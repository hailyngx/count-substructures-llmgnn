Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 8

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with degree less than 3: 2, 3, 4

Nodes with degree 3 or more:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8)>
<6, (1, 9)>
<7, (1, 5)>
<8, (5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
