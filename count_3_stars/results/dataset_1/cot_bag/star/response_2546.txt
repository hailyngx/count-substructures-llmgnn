Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first list out the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, we will look at nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0, having 3 neighbors, forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1, having 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2, having 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3, having 4 neighbors, forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4, having 5 neighbors, forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7, having 5 neighbors, forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9, having 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 27 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 4, 7>
- <2, 0, 7, 9>
- <3, 1, 4, 7>
- <4, 0, 1, 7>
- <7, 0, 1, 2>
- <7, 0, 1, 3>
- <7, 0, 1, 4>
- <7, 1, 2, 3>
- <7, 1, 2, 4>
- <7, 2, 3, 4>
- <9, 2, 3, 5>
