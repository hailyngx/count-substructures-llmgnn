Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The 3-stars in this graph are:
[6]
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 1)>
<7, (2, 5, 1)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
