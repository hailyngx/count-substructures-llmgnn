Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 1), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3)

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {2, 5, 6}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 9}
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: {1, 7}
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {1, 2}
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {5, 8}
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: {3, 7}
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>
