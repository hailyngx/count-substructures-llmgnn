Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 62 \).

So, the final answer is [62] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>.
