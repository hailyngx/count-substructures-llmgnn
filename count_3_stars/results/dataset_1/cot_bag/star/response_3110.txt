Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars in the graph. 

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 1, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 0)>, <1, (0, 9, 8)>, <1, (9, 8, 0)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 1)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>, <4, (3, 2, 1)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 2)>, <8, (2, 1, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 1)>, <8, (3, 1, 2)>, <8, (3, 2, 1)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 5)>, <8, (5, 7, 1)>, <8, (5, 1, 7)>, <8, (7, 1, 5)>, <8, (7, 5, 1)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 2, 7)>, <8, (7, 2, 5)>, <8, (7, 5, 2)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 5)>.
