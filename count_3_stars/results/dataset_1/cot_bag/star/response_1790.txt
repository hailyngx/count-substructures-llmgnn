Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 5, 7
- 1 is connected to 3, 5, 9
- 2 is connected to 5, 6, 9
- 3 is connected to 1, 5, 9
- 4 is connected to 9
- 5 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- 6 is connected to 2, 5, 7
- 7 is connected to 0, 5, 6, 8
- 8 is connected to 7
- 9 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Applying the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, we see that they do not form any additional 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
