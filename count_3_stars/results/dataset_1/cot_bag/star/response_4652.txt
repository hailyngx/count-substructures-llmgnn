Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 18 edges in the graph. Let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of [7] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
