Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
   1 -- 8 -- 0 -- 7
         |    |  /
         9    5 4
         |    | /
         2 -- 6
```

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 4, 6

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars from these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3, giving us the final result: [3].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>.
