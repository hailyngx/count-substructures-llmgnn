Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 8

So, there are 8 3-stars in total:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <6, (2, 1, 5)>, <6, (3, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 6, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
