Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 0, 8
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} =  4\)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 0, 1
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>
