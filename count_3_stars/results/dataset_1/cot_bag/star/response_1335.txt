Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( {1 \choose 3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( {1 \choose 3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9.

So, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars are: 
  - <0, 1, 6, 9>
  - <7, 1, 2, 6>
  - <7, 1, 6, 8>
  - <7, 2, 6, 8>
  - <7, 6, 8, 4>
  - <7, 6, 8, 5>
  - <8, 4, 6, 7>
  - <8, 5, 6, 7>
  - <8, 6, 7, 1>
