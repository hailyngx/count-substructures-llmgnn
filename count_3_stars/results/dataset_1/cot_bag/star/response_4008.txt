Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph doesn't have any 3-stars. Let's calculate it:  

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7  
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 6, 8  
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 2  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9  
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7  
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:  
\[ [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [10] \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 10, and they are as follows:  
<0, (1, 2, 9)>,  
<1, (0, 3, 5)>,  
<1, (0, 3, 8)>,  
<1, (0, 5, 8)>,  
<1, (3, 6, 7)>,  
<2, (0, 5, 7)>,  
<3, (1, 6, 7)>,  
<6, (3, 4, 9)>,  
<7, (2, 3, 8)>,  
<8, (1, 4, 7)>.
