Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 7

So, the central nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding all of these up, we get a total of 48 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [48]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>.
