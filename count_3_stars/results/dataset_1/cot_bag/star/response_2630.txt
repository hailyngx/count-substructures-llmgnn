Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars using the mentioned method:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of 6 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, and <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
