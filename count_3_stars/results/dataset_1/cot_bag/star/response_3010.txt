Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 1 = 15 \).

Inside brackets, we have [15].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 0, 4>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <3, 1, 0>
- <3, 1, 5>
- <3, 2, 9>
- <3, 5, 0>
- <4, 0, 7>
- <5, 0, 8>

Putting the final number inside brackets and listing the unique 3-stars, we get:
[15]
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 7, 4>, <0, 8, 5>, <0, 8, 9>, <1, 0, 4>, <1, 3, 5>, <3, 1, 0>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 2, 9>, <3, 5, 0>, <4, 0, 7>, <5, 0, 8>
