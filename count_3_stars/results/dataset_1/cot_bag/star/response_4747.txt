Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 4, 8
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 6, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
