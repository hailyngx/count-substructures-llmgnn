Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 1: 4, 5
Node 2: 0, 3, 6
Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 6
Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 7: 8
Node 8: 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 5, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing up these values: \(4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 31\)

Therefore, there are [31] unique 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
