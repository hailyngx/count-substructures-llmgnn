Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can construct the following graph:

The 3-star centered at node 0 is <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (6, 4, 8)>, <0, (8, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>.

The 3-star centered at node 2 is <2, (0, 4, 3)>.

The 3-star centered at node 4 is <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 0, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.

The 3-star centered at node 6 is <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>.

The 3-star centered at node 7 is <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars is [14].
