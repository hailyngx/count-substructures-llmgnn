Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the graph are as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 6), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3)}

Now, we will determine the 3-stars in the graph:
For node 0: has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 2: has 2 neighbors (0, 7) => [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
For node 3: has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 8, 9) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For node 4: has 2 neighbors (3, 6) => [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
For node 6: has 1 neighbor (4) => [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars
For node 7: has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 8: has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 9: has 2 neighbors (1, 3) => [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3, 8>
<3, 0, 8, 7>
<3, 0, 9, 1>
<3, 4, 6, 4>
<7, 2, 3, 8>
