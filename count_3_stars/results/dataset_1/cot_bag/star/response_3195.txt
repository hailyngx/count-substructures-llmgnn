Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
4. Node 9 has 8 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 4 + 4 + 56 = 65

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (8, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 4)>
