Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8), so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 9), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (6, 8, 9), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9), so it forms 1 3-star. 
Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 7), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
