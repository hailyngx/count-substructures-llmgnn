Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

For Node 0, it has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 2, it also has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 4, it has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
For Node 5, it has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
For Node 7, it has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 8, it has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 9, it has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 5)>
