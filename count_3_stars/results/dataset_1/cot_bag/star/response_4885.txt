Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in this graph, numbered from 0 to 9, and 24 edges connecting them, as provided. 

Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4}

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: 1 3-star
2. Node 1: 3 3-stars
3. Node 2: 1 3-star
4. Node 3: 1 3-star
5. Node 4: 3 3-stars
6. Node 5: 1 3-star
7. Node 6: 1 3-star
8. Node 7: 1 3-star
9. Node 8: 0 3-stars
10. Node 9: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [11]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 2, 0)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<10, (3, 6, 0)>
<11, (4, 5, 1)>
