Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see which nodes are directly connected to it, and then determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, 6: <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 7)>.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 4, 8: <3, (1, 0, 5)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>.
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 8, 9: <7, (2, 3, 4)>.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 9: <8, (3, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2 + 3 + 1 + 1] = [7].

The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 0, 5)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>.
