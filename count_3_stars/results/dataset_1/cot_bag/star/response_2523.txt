Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
