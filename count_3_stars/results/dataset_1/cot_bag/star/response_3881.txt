Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star. [1]
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors so it can form 4 3-stars. [1 + 4 = 5]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors so it can form 1 3-star. [1 + 4 + 1 = 6]
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors so it can form 10 3-stars. [1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16]
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor so it cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 16, and they are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
