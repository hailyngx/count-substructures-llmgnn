Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbor {7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbor {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

In total, there are \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 \) 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (4, 9, 0)>
- <5, (4, 9, 3)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].
