Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 6)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore,  the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
