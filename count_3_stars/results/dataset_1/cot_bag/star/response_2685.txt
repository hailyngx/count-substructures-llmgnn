Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: 
- It has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6).
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 3 = 1 3-star.

For node 1: 
- It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7).
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 2: 
- It has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5).
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 3 = 1 3-star.

For node 5: 
- It has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 7, 8).
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 5 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>.
