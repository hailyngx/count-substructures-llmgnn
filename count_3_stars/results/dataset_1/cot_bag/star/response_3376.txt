Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4] \]

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, 8, 6, 1>
<1, 6, 8, 0>
<2, 7, 8, 0>
<8, 7, 2, 3>
