Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 24 \)

So, in total, there are 24 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:

\[ [24] \]

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (5, 2, 7)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>

<3, (1, 9, 3)>
<5, (0, 7, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 0)>
<5, (3, 7, 2)>
<7, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (0, 5, 3)>
