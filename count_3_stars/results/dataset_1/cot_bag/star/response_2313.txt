Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the edge list, let's represent the graph:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: (0, 7), (2, 9), (3, 7), (4, 5), (5, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 9), (9, 2), (9, 7)  

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 4 and Node 5 have 1 neighbor each, so they cannot form 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 2, 3 have 1 or 2 neighbors, so they also cannot form 3-stars.

Now calculate the number of 3-stars:  
By considering the node with 4 neighbors:
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

By considering the node with 3 neighbors:
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 0)>
<9, (2, 7, 3)>
<9, (2, 7, 0)> 
<9, (2, 7, 3)>
