Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1] = 28 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 6)>
