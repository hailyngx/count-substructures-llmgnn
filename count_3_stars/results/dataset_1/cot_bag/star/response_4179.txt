Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9. 

For node 0: It has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 1: It has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 2: It has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: It has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 5), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 9: It has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 33, gives the total number of 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
