Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
