Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph based on the provided edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.

Following the approach described earlier, let's compute the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <0, (2, 4, 5)>

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>

- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>

- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
  <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, 
  <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, 
  <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 9)>, 
  <6, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 33. Hence, the final answer is [33].
