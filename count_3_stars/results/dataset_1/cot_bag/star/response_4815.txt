Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8 (degree: 4)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 8 (degree: 2)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6 (degree: 3)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 3, 8 (degree: 3)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3 (degree: 2)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 7 (degree: 2)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 6, 9 (degree: 3)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 7, 8 (degree: 2)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with a degree of 3 or more:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <3, (4, 5, 6)>
  
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <4, (0, 3, 8)>
  
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <7, (2, 6, 9)>
  
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 11.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>.
