Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 2, Node 5, and Node 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 2:
Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 6 neighbors of Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For Node 5:
Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 8 neighbors of Node 5: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)

For Node 8:
Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5 neighbors of Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 56 + 10 = 86 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [86].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>

<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>

The final answer is [86].
