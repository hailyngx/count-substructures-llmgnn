Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (it has 5 neighbors)
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9 (it has 3 neighbors)
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 5, 7 (it has 3 neighbors)
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 8 (it has 2 neighbors)
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 3, 9 (it has 3 neighbors)
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 7 (it has 2 neighbors)
Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9 (it has 4 neighbors)
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 4, 9 (it has 3 neighbors)
Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8 (it has 4 neighbors)

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 22 \)

Therefore, there are 22 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [19].
