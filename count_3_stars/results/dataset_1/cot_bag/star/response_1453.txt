Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 5)}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 6. It forms 1 3-star. <0, 4, 6>
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 9. It forms 1 3-star. <1, 6, 9>
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 4. It forms 1 3-star. <2, 3, 4>
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 2. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 2 (note that 2 is counted twice due to the double edge). It forms 1 3-star. <4, 0, 2>
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 9. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, and 8. It can form 4 3-stars. <6, 0, 4>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 7, 0>, <6, 8, 0>
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 6. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 6. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 5. It forms 1 3-star. <9, 1, 6>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10.
Hence, the final answer is [10].
