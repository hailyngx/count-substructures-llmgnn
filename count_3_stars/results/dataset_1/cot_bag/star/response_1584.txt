Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3 and node 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 3 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 5: Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars centered at node 5 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 20] = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
