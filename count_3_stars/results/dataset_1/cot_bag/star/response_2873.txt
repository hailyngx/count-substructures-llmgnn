Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 6)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 6)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (1, 3)

Using the formula \(  \binom{n}{3} \), the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors is:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 \]

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>

So, the final answer is: [8]
