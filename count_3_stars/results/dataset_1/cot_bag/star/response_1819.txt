Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 3 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 3 neighbors
Node 8 has 5 neighbors
Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 20

So, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in this graph. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
