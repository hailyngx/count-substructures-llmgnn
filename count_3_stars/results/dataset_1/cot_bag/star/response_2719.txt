Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 7}

Looking at the list, we see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors. Let's count the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
