Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will first construct the graph based on the given edges. Then, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors to count the 3-stars.

The graph based on the given edges is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 5), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 9), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 9: 5, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 9 can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 6.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
