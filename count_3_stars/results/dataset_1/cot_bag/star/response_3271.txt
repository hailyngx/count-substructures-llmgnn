Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors first.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9, 0
Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 20 = 30.  

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

[30]

<4, (5, 7, 8)>  
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
