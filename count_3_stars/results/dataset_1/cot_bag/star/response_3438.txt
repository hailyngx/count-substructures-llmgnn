Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 69 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 8)>,
