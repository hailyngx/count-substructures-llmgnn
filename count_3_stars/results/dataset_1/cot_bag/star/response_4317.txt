Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8)]

Now, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
