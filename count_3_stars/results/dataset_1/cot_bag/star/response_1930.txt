Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes that have at least 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
