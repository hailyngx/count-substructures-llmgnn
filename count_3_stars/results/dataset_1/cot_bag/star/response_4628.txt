Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
With 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 3: 4, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 4
Node 8: 1, 4, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 20 = 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [71].

Unique 3-stars:
