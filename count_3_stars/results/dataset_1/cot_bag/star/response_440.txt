Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To start, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

This completes the analysis of the 3-stars in the graph.
