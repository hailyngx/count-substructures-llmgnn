Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9\)

Therefore, the final answer is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
