Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has 7 neighbors.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors.
Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 all have less than 3 neighbors.

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

So there are 35 + 20 = 55 3-stars in total. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (7, 3, 9)>, <1, (8, 0, 9)>, <1, (8, 2, 5)>, <1, (8, 6, 9)>, <1, (9, 0, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (2, 1, 5)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 2, 1)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)> 

So the final answer is [55].
