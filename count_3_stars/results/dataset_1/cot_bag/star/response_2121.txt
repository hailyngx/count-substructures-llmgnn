Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's find the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9. So, it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, and 8. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8. So, it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, and 6. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
