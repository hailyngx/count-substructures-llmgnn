Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

The edges are: 
(2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9)
(3, 5)
(4, 2), (4, 7)
(5, 3), (5, 8)
(6, 7), (6, 8)
(7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6)
(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9)
(9, 2), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors : 4, 7, 9
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 5 has 2 neighbors
Node 6 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 3 neighbors : 2, 4, 6
Node 8 has 3 neighbors : 5, 6, 9
Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
