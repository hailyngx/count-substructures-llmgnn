Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up: 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 37

So, there are 37 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 3)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 0)>
- <7, (3, 9, 0)>
- <7, (3, 9, 4)>
- <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 4)>
- <9, (7, 4, 8)>
- <9, (7, 4, 6)>
