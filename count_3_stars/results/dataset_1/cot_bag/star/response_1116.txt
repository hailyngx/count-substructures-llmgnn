Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the node list based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Next, let's denote the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula explained earlier:
Number of 3-stars = [ (3 choose 3) + (4 choose 3) + (4 choose 3) + (4 choose 3) ] = [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [13]

Therefore, there are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
