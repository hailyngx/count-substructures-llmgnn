Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: This node has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 2: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, and 9) which form 1 3-star each with node 2 as the center. So, node 2 forms 3 3-stars in total.
- Node 3: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, and 5) which form 1 3-star each with node 3 as the center. So, node 3 forms 3 3-stars in total.
- Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, and 6) which form 1 3-star each with node 4 as the center. So, node 4 forms 3 3-stars in total.
- Node 5: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, and 4) which form 1 3-star each with node 5 as the center. So, node 5 forms 3 3-stars in total.
- Node 6: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, and 8) which form 1 3-star each with node 6 as the center. So, node 6 forms 3 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3] = [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>.

So, the answer is [12]. Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>.
