Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

```
        0 -- 1 -- 4
           / | \   
          9  5  8
             | / 
             9
             |
             5
             |
             8
             |
             7
             |
             2
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 4, 9)>
- <1, (9, 5, 4)>
- <1, (9, 4, 5)>
- <1, (9, 5, 8)>
- <1, (9, 8, 5)>
- <1, (5, 1, 9)>
- <1, (9, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 9, 8)>
- <5, (1, 9, 4)>
- <5, (8, 1, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 4)>
