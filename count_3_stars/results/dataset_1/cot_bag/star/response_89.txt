Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 9  
Node 1: 2, 5  
Node 2: 1, 7, 9  
Node 3: 6  
Node 4: 5, 8, 9  
Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9  
Node 6: 3, 5, 7  
Node 7: 2, 6, 8  
Node 8: 4, 7  
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5  

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For node 1, there is 1 3-star. 
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there is 1 3-star.
- For node 7, there is 1 3-star.
- For node 8, there is 1 3-star.
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:   
\[ [18] \]
