Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 15 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 6. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 4. Not enough neighbors for any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 7. Not enough neighbors for any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 6. Only 1 3-star possible with node 4 as the center.
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. So, there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8. Only 1 3-star possible with node 9 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>,
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (6, 7, 8)>
