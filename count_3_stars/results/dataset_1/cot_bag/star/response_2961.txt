Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 3, 4, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

So there are a total of \(1 + 4 + 4 = 9\) 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (4, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

So the final answer is [9].
