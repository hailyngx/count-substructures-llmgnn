Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 
Here is the list of nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 5
Node 1: 4, 7, 9
Node 2: 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 7
Node 4: 1, 9
Node 5: 0, 7, 8
Node 6: 2, 7, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 2, 5
Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

Node 0: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)
Node 1: \({inom{3}{3}} = 1\)
Node 2: \({inom{3}{3}} = 1\)
Node 3: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)
Node 4: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)
Node 5: \({inom{3}{3}} = 1\)
Node 6: \({inom{3}{3}} = 1\)
Node 7: \({inom{6}{3}} = 20\)
Node 8: \({inom{2}{3}} = 0\)
Node 9: \({inom{3}{3}} = 1\)

Adding these up, we have a total of 25 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
