Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 6)
(1, 3), (1, 9)
(2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9)
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 9)
(5, 6)
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 9)
(7, 9)
(8, 2)
(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, we need to identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Looking at the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 0
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 6

Nodes with 3 or more edges are: 2, 3, 6, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 9, 2)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 2, 3)>, <3, (9, 3, 6)>, <3, (9, 6, 0)>, <3, (9, 7, 1)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (6, 0, 3)>, <6, (6, 5, 9)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 7, 1)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 9, 3)>, <9, (2, 9, 6)>, <9, (3, 0, 6)>, <9, (6, 0, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 9)>, <9, (6, 5, 9)>, <9, (9, 1, 3)>, <9, (9, 1, 7)>, <9, (9, 2, 3)>, <9, (9, 2, 6)>, <9, (9, 3, 6)>, <9, (9, 6, 0)>, <9, (9, 6, 7)>
