Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3}   
Node 1: {0, 2}   
Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}   
Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 9}   
Node 4: {3, 8}   
Node 5: {7}   
Node 6: {2}   
Node 7: {2, 3, 5, 8}   
Node 8: {2, 4, 7}   
Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, let's go through each node to find the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- For Node 0: [](Total 3-stars: [1])   
- For Node 1: [](Total 3-stars: [1])   
- For Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 3, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>[](Total 3-stars: [21])   
- For Node 3: [](Total 3-stars: [0])   
- For Node 4: [](Total 3-stars: [0])   
- For Node 5: [](Total 3-stars: [0])   
- For Node 6: [](Total 3-stars: [0])   
- For Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>[](Total 3-stars: [6])   
- For Node 8: [](Total 3-stars: [0])   
- For Node 9: [](Total 3-stars: [0])   

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 21 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 0] = [29].
