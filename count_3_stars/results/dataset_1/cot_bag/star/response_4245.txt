Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

So, there are a total of 18 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>.
