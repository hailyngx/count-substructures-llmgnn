Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
0: 5, 9
1: 7
2: 6
4: 6, 7
5: 0, 7, 8
6: 2, 4, 8, 9
7: 1, 4, 5, 9
8: 5, 6
9: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0, there are 2 3-stars: <0, (5, 7, 9)> and <0, (5, 7, 8)>
For node 4, there are 2 3-stars: <4, (6, 7, 9)> and <4, (6, 7, 5)>
For node 5, there are 2 3-stars: <5, (0, 7, 8)> and <5, (0, 7, 9)>
For node 6, there are 5 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>, and <6, (8, 5, 7)>
For node 7, there are 2 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)> and <7, (1, 4, 5)>
For node 9, there is 1 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [2 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 1] = 14 3-stars.
