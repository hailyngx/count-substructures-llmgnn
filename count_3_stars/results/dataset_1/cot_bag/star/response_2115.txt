Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

For Node 0: It has 2 neighbors (8, 9) => we can form 1 3-star with this node
For Node 1: It has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 8) => we can form 1 3-star with this node
For Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (6, 7, 8, 9) => we can form 1 3-star with this node
For Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8) => we can form 1 3-star with this node
For Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8) => we can form 1 3-star with this node
For Node 6: It has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 7, 8) => we can form 1 3-star with this node
For Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 9) => we can form 1 3-star with this node
For Node 8: It has 7 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9) => we can form 3 3-stars with this node
For Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 7, 8) => we can form 1 3-star with this node

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 3, 5>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 1, 6>
<4, 5, 6>
<6, 2, 7>
<7, 3, 9>
<8, 0, 1>
<8, 0, 2>
<8, 0, 3>
