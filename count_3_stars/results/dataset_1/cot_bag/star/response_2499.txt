Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 4, and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
  - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
  - Number of 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For node 4:
  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
  - Number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars for node 4: <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 7:
  - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
  - Number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars for node 7: <7, (3, 4, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1] = [5]
