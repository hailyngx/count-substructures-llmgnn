Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

1. Node 1:
   There are 4 neighbors of node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7.
   The number of 3-stars centered at node 1 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

2. Node 2:
   There are 2 neighbors of node 2: 1, 9.
   As node 2 does not have at least 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

3. Node 6:
   There are 4 neighbors of node 6: 0, 1, 7, 8.
   The number of 3-stars centered at node 6 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

4. Node 7:
   There are 3 neighbors of node 7: 1, 6, 1.
   The number of 3-stars centered at node 7 = 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

5. Node 8:
   There is only 1 neighbor of node 8: 6.
   As node 8 does not have at least 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars from each applicable node gives a total of 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
