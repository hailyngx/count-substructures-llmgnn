Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
    1 --- 5 --- 3 --- 7
   /|    /|        /|
  6 |   0 |       / |
   \|  /  |      /  |
    8 --- 2 --- 4 --- [9]
```

Based on the given edges, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows: 
- Node 0: (1, 2, 8, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 2: (0, 4, 6)
- Node 3: (5, 7)
- Node 4: (2, 7)
- Node 5: (1, 3, 6)
- Node 6: (1, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 6, 7)
- Node 9: (0)

Now, we'll determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph by checking each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: No 3-star (not enough neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-star (not enough neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star (not enough neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-star (not enough neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: No 3-star (not enough neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17

So, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 8, 6)>
- <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (6, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 0, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 0)>
- <6, (1, 8, 5)>
- <6, (2, 1, 0)>
- <6, (2, 1, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 1)>
- <6, (8, 0, 1)>
- <6, (8, 1, 0)>
- <6, (8, 1, 5)>
- <6, (8, 5, 1)>
