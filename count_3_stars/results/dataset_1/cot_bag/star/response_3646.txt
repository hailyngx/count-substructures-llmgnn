Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7 => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8 => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7 => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>
 
Putting it all together, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
