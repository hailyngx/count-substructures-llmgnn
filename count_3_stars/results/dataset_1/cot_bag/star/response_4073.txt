Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 have at least three neighbors each. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 7, 8). Hence, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
2. Node 1: Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7). Hence, there is only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center.
3. Node 3: Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9). Hence, there is only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.
4. Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6). Hence, there is only 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
5. Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6). Hence, the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
6. Node 8: Node 8 has 2 neighbors (0, 5) which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed with node 8.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [17] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 0)>, <7, (1, 0, 6)>
