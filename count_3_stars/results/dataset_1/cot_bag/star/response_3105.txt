Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 6}
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 7}
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: {5, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up, there are a total of 7 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>
