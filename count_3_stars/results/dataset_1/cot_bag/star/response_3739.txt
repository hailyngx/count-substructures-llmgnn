Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's first list the graph in a visual format:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Edges: (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 8)>

- Node 8: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <8, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <8, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12, and they are: 
<1, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
