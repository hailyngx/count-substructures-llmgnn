Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's determine the total number of 3-stars and identify them:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed at each node:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [17]

Unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
