Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10 \)

Therefore, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is 10.

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (8, 9, 4)>
- <6, (9, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
