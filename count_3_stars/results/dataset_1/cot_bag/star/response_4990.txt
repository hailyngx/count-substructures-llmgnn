Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6] \]

So, there are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 0, 3>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <3, 1, 8>
- <5, 0, 7>
- <6, 0, 9>
