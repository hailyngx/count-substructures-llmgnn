Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way:

```
    1 - 9 - 0 - 3
        |
    4 - 6 - 8 - 7
    |     |
    5     1
```

From the graph, we can see the following connections:
- Node 0 has neighbors 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 1 has neighbors 9.
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 6 has neighbors 4, 8.
- Node 8 has neighbors 6, 7.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by applying the formula mentioned earlier:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 2.

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 3, 4, 9>
- <4, 0, 5, 6>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
