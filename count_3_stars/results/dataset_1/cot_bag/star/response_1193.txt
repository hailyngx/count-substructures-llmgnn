Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
Total = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 9, 8>
- <5, 2, 8>
- <5, 4, 8>
- <8, 0, 1>
- <8, 0, 2>
- <8, 0, 3>
- <8, 0, 5>
- <8, 0, 9>
- <8, 1, 0>
- <8, 2, 3>
- <8, 2, 5>
- <8, 2, 7>
- <8, 3, 2>
- <8, 5, 2>
- <8, 5, 4>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <8, 9, 4>
