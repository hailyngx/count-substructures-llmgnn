Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 9, 2
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
