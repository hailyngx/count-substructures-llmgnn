Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7).
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
3. Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
4. Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
5. Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
6. Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9).
8. Node 8 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 9).
9. Node 9 has 6 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7, 8).

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars formed: 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
