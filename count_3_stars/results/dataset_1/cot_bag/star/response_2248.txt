Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8. So, it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>.
