Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: It has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 8, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

2. Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7). There is only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center, i.e., <3, (2, 5, 7)>.

3. Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8). There is only 1 3-star with node 4 as the center, i.e., <4, (0, 2, 8)>.

4. Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9). There is only 1 3-star with node 5 as the center, i.e., <5, (3, 6, 9)>.

5. Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

6. Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

7. Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25.

Putting this final number inside brackets [] gives us [25].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>.
