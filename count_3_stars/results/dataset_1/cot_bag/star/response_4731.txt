Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes, we will first analyze each node's connections:

Node 0: {2, 7}
Node 1: {5, 6, 7}
Node 2: {0, 4, 9}
Node 3: {5, 6}
Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6}
Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 7: {0, 1}
Node 8: {4, 6}
Node 9: {2, 4}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these together: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
