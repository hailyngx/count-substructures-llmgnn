Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 34

So, there are 34 3-stars in total. 

Unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<5, 7, 9>  

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.
