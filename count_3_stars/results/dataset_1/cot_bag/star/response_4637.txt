Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edge list, we can deduce the following neighbor counts for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 26 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [26].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 3)>
<1, (2, 1, 8)>
<1, (2, 1, 9)>
<1, (3, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
