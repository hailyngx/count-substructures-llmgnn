Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8). Possible 3-stars = 1. 
	<0, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8). Possible 3-stars = 1. 
	<1, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4). Possible 3-stars = 0. 
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9). Possible 3-stars = 1. 
	<3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7). Possible 3-stars = 1. 
	<4, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 5: (5, 8). Possible 3-stars = 0. 
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9). Possible 3-stars = 0. 
- Node 7: (7, 4). Possible 3-stars = 0. 
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9). Possible 3-stars = 1. 
	<8, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8). Possible 3-stars = 1. 
	<9, (3, 6, 8)>
   
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].   
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>.
