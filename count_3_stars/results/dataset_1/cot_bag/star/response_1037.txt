Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors along with their neighbors:

Node 0: 4, 5, 7
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 6: 4, 5, 7
Node 7: 0, 6, 9

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7. 
Thus, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
