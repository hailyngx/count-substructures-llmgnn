Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges: (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 5), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 6)

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 2: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 6: 4 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 7: 2 neighbors
Node 8: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 1 neighbor

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
