Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes in the graph with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 8
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 8)>

For node 1: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, and 5
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [30]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>
