Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 6, 7), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 9), so there is 1 3-star with node 1.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 7, 9), so there is 1 3-star with node 2.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 6, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 5), so there is 1 3-star with node 9.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 31
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
