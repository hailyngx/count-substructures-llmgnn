Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 3
    |    | 
    5    2 -- 9
         |    |
         4 -- 7
         |    |
         6 -- 8
```

Next, let's list the nodes with their neighbors for easy reference:
- 0: 1, 2, 5, 8
- 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- 3: 1
- 4: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- 5: 0, 4, 6
- 6: 4, 5, 8
- 7: 1, 2, 4
- 8: 0, 1, 2, 6
- 9: 2, 4

Let's determine the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 48

Inside brackets [], we have: [48]

And the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 4, 6>
