Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

There are a total of 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
