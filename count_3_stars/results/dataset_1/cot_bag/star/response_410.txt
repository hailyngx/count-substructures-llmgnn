Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>
