Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 4 cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16 \).

So the total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 9, 3)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 3, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
<9, (4, 7, 5)>
<9, (7, 1, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 3)>
<9, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (9, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 9, 3)>
<0, (9, 7, 4)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
