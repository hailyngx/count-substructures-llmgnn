Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 5
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2

There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0 and 2.

For node 0:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Total number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: 10

For node 2:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Total number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: 10

Total number of 3-stars: 10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 2) = 20 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 4, 2)>
- <0, (7, 2, 8)>
- <2, (4, 3, 5)>
- <2, (5, 8, 3)>
- <2, (7, 8, 3)>
- <2, (8, 5, 0)>
- <2, (9, 5, 0)>
