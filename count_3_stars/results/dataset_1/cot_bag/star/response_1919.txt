Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
Node 1 is connected to node 5.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 = 8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
