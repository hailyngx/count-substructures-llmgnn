Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: node 0 and node 9.
Calculating for node 0:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10
\]
Calculating for node 9:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10
\]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>

The final answer is [20].
