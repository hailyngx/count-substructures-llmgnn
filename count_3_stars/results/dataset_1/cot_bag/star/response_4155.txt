Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>.
