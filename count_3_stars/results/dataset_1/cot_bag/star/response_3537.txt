Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:

- Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 3, 7)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 5, 8)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 8)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 3, 9)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 2)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 3, 6)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 10] = 12 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (6, 9, 0)>, 
<3, (6, 9, 1)>, 
<3, (6, 9, 5)>, 
<3, (9, 6, 0)>, 
<3, (9, 6, 1)>
