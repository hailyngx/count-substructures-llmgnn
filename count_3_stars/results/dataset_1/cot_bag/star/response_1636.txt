Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9. 

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it can form.

- For node 0: There are 2 neighbors (8, 9), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- For node 3: There are 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8). This node can form 1 3-star.
- For node 4: There are 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7). This node can form 1 3-star.
- For node 5: There are 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8). This node can form 1 3-star.
- For node 7: There are 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9). This node can form 1 3-star.
- For node 8: There are 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 6). This node can form 4 3-stars.
- For node 9: There are 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7). This node can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (2, 7, 4)>
