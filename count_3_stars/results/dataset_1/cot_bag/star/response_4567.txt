Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9 has neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5,7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 5:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Adding these up:
\[ [10 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [25] \] 

Therefore, there are 25 total 3-stars. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 3, 9)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 5)>
<9, (7, 4, 5)>
<9, (7, 5, 9)> 

Thus, there are 25 total 3-stars in the given graph.
