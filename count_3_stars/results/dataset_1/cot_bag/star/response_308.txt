Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:  
Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8  
Node 1: 0, 3, 7  
Node 2: 3, 6, 8  
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 4: 0, 3, 9  
Node 5: 0, 3  
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8  
Node 7: 1  
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6  
Node 9: 3, 4  

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 1: 0  
Node 2: 0  
Node 3: 1  
Node 4: 0  
Node 5: 0  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19

So, the final answer is [19].  
Now, listing the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 3, 9)>
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (8, 2, 6)>
<0, (8, 3, 6)>
<0, (8, 6, 2)>
<0, (8, 6, 3)>
<(1, 7, 3)>
<(6, 2, 8)> 
<(6, 3, 8)> 
<(6, 8, 2)> 
<(6, 8, 3)>
