Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
3. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
4. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
5. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
6. <2, (1, 6, 7)>
7. <3, (1, 2, 9)>
8. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
9. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
10. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
11. <6, (0, 2, 5)>
12. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
13. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
14. <6, (4, 5, 7)>
15. <7, (2, 4, 6)>
16. <7, (2, 5, 8)>
17. <7, (2, 6, 9)>
18. <7, (4, 5, 9)>
19. <7, (5, 6, 9)>
20. <9, (3, 5, 7)>
