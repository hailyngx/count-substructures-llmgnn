Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's determine how many 3-stars can be formed from each node:

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [0]

Summing up all the possible 3-stars: 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
