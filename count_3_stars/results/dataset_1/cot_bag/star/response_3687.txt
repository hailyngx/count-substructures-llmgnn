Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph described:

                        0
                       / \
                      1   3
                     /|\   |\
                    2 5 6  4 8 
                       |     |\
                       9     7 5 
                                 

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:

Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 1, 8)>, <1, (8, 5, 9)>, <1, (9, 7, 8)> (total 6)
Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 1, 8)>, <5, (4, 1, 8)>, <5, (8, 1, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 1)>, <5, (9, 1, 8)> (total 8)
Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 5)>, <9, (5, 1, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (7, 1, 9)>, <9, (8, 1, 5)>, <9, (8, 5, 1)> (total 8)

Hence, [6 + 8 + 8] = [22] total 3-stars can be formed in this graph.
