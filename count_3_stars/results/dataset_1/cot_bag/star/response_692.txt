Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star:
<4, (2, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
