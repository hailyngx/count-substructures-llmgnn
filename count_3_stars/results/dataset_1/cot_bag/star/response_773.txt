Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars for each suitable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 26

So, there are [26] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (8, 9, 5)>
- <0, (8, 9, 6)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (7, 3, 5)>
- <9, (7, 3, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
