Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: neighbors 6, 7
- Node 1: neighbors 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: neighbors 4, 8
- Node 3: neighbors 5, 8
- Node 4: neighbors 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: neighbors 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: neighbors 0, 1
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: neighbors 4, 5

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars originating from each node:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [3]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [2]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [2]
- Node 9: [1]

Adding them up, we get a total of [13] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 3)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 0)>, <4, (5, 3, 1)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (0, 7, 1)>, <6, (1, 0, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 1)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (5, 3, 8)>
