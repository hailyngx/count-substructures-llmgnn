Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the connections to determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [7].
