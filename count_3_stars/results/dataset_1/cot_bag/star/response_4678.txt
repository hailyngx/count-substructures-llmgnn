Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
  
  - Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
  - Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 3
  - Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
  - Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8
  - Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 20 + 4 = 25 \)

Therefore, there are [25] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
