Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 4, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 4)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <3, (1, 6, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 0, 8)>, <4, (6, 3, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 0, 8)>, 
  <6, (4, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 3)>, <6, (7, 0, 8)>, <6, (8, 4, 0)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 1, 5)>, <8, (3, 6, 4)>, <8, (4, 0, 6)>, 
  <8, (4, 6, 0)>, <8, (5, 1, 3)>, <8, (6, 0, 4)>, <8, (6, 4, 0)>, <8, (6, 4, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 29.
