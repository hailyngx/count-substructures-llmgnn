Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 2: 1 3-star formed with nodes (3, 5, 6) 
Node 3: 1 3-star formed with nodes (2, 5, 6)
Node 5: 1 3-star formed with nodes (3, 4, 7)
Node 6: 1 3-star formed with nodes (2, 3, 7)

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
