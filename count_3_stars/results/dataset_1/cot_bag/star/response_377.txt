Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now let's find the total number of 3-star graphs:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-star graphs.
Node 5 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-star graphs.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star graph.

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 3-star graphs. 

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-star graphs are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>

<0, (1, 5, 7)>

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (6, 0, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 1)>

<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 9, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (6, 9, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (6, 9, 7)>
<9, (1, 0, 5)>
