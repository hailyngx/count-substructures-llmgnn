Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9. 

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at nodes with at least 3 neighbors. 
Let's find the 3-stars: 

For node 2, it has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7), so there is 1 3-star <2, (3, 5, 7)>.
For node 3, it has 2 neighbors (2, 4), not enough for a 3-star.
For node 4, it has 2 neighbors (3, 6), not enough for a 3-star.
For node 5, it has 2 neighbors (2, 6), not enough for a 3-star.
For node 6, it has 2 neighbors (4, 5), not enough for a 3-star.
For node 7, it has 1 neighbor (2), not enough for a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <2, (3, 5, 7)>.
