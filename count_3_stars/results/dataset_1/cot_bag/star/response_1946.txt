Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8 is connected to node 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 9, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
