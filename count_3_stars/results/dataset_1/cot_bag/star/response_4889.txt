Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4, as denoted by [4].

Thus, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
