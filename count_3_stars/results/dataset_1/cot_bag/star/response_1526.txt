Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.

For node 1, we have 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 9). So, there is only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 5, 9)>.

For node 3, we have 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 6). So, there is only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (2, 5, 6)>.

For node 4, we have 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 8, 9). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>.

For node 9, we have 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 6). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 9) = 10. 
So, in brackets [] we have the total number of 3-stars as [10].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 6)>,
<4, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 9)>.
