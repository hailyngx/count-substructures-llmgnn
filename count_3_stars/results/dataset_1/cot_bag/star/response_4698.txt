Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
