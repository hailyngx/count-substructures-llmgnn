Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 24. 

So, the final result is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
