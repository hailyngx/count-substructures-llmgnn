Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Applying the method described:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5)>
