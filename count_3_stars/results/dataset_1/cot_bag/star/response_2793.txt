Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed. 

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 18.

Therefore, the answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
