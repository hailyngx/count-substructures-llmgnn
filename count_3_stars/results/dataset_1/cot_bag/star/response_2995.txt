Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors with 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors that can form 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors that can form 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors that can form 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors that can form 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors with 3 or more neighbors.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( \binom{2}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
