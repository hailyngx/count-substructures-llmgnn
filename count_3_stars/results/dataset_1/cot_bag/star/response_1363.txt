Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9.

For node 0, there are 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5. So, there are \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
For node 1, there are 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8. So, there are \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
For node 4, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2. So, there are \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
For node 7, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 9. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7. So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.

In total, there are \(1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24\) 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
