Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in the given graph, we first list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({2 \choose 3} = 0\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 6  \]

So, there are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, 1, 2, 9>
- <2, 0, 3, 7>
- <3, 1, 2, 9>
- <3, 0, 2, 9>
- <3, 0, 1, 9>
- <3, 0, 1, 2> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
