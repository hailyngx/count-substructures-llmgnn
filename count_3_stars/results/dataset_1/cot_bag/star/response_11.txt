Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 3, 8
Node 5: 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 6
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Let's identify the possible 3-stars based on the nodes:

From Node 0:
- 1 3-star can be formed since Node 0 has exactly 3 neighbors: <0, 3, 4, 8>
  
From Node 1:
- 1 3-star can be formed since Node 1 has exactly 3 neighbors: <1, 5, 6, 9>
  
From Node 3:
- 1 3-star can be formed since Node 3 has exactly 3 neighbors: <3, 0, 4, 8>
  
From Node 4:
- 1 3-star can be formed since Node 4 has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, 0, 3, 8>
  
From Node 5:
- No 3-star can be formed as Node 5 has only 4 neighbors.

From Node 6:
- 1 3-star can be formed since Node 6 has exactly 3 neighbors: <6, 1, 5, 9>
  
From Node 8:
- 1 3-star can be formed since Node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, 0, 3, 4>
- 1 3-star can be formed since Node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors: <8, 5, 6, 9>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [6].
