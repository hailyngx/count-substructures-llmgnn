Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
Node 1: No 3-star can be formed since it only has 2 neighbors.
Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8. <2, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 5: No 3-star can be formed since it only has 2 neighbors.
Node 6: No 3-star can be formed since it only has 2 neighbors.
Node 7: No 3-star can be formed since it only has 4 neighbors.
Node 8: No 3-star can be formed since it only has 3 neighbors.
Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4. <9, (1, 2, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars is 3. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, and <9, (1, 2, 4)>. Therefore, the final result is [3].
