Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's go through each node to see if they are part of a 3-star and if so, how many 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: Connected to 4 other nodes (6, 7, 8, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 1: Connected to node 2
  - No 3-star is formed with node 1
  
- Node 2: Connected to node 1
  - No 3-star is formed with node 2

- Node 3: Connected to 2 other nodes (6, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 4: Connected to node 8
  - No 3-star is formed with node 4
  
- Node 5: Connected to 2 other nodes (7, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 6: Connected to 2 other nodes (0, 3)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 7: Connected to 2 other nodes (0, 5)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

- Node 8: Connected to 4 other nodes (0, 3, 4, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>

- Node 9: Connected to 3 other nodes (0, 5, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Correction:
There is a mistake in the calculation for node 9. It is actually connected to 4 nodes (0, 5, 8). Thus, the correct number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), and the correct unique 3-stars are <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 8, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 8)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9, and the unique 3-stars found are:
\[ [~, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)> ~] \]
