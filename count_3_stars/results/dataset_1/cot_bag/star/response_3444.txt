Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms 3-stars with its neighbors 3, 5, and 9. So, there are 1 3-star with node 2 at the center.
Node 5 forms 3-stars with its neighbors 2, 4, and 8. So, there are 1 3-star with node 5 at the center.

Putting this information together, we have:

- Total number of 3-stars: [2]
- Unique 3-stars: <<2, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>
