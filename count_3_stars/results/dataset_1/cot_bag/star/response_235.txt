Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- 1: 0, 6
- 2: 5, 9
- 3: 6, 7
- 4: 0, 7, 8
- 5: 0, 2, 6, 8
- 6: 1, 3, 5, 9
- 7: 0, 3, 4
- 8: 4, 5
- 9: 0, 2, 6

Nodes 0, 5, and 6 have 5 neighbors each, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \), which we represent as [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 9, 4)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
