Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 9: 4

We'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>.
