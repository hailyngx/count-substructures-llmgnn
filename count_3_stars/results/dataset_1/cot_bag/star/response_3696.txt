Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 7) => [1] 3-star
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (2, 7) => No 3-star
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (1, 8) => No 3-star
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (4) => No 3-star
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (3, 5, 8, 9) => [1] 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9) => [1] 3-star
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (0, 3) => No 3-star
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (0, 1) => No 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4) => [1] 3-star
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (4, 5) => No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
