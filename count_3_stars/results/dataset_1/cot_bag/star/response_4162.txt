Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 6, 7

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (0, 1, 6)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 4, 5)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (2, 8, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <8, (3, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 16. 

Thus, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>,
<6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>,
<6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>,
<7, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>
