Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8} (6 nodes)
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to node 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with 3 or more neighbors.

Calculations:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
