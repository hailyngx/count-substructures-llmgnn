Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine the potential 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
