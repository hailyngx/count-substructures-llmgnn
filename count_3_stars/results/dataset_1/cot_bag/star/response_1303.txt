Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph following the method described:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9
   In this case, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0. 
   Therefore, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>.

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5
   There's only 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (2, 3, 5)>.

3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
   There's only 1 3-star with node 2: <2, (0, 1, 8)>.

4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 6
   There's only 1 3-star with node 3: <3, (1, 4, 6)>.

5. Nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 do not have at least 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7.  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>.
