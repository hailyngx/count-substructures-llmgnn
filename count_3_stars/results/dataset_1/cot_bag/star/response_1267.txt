Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 7 and 9
- 1 is connected to 5 and 6
- 2 is connected to 6 and 7
- 3 is connected to 8
- 4 is connected to 5
- 5 is connected to 1, 4, and 9
- 6 is connected to 1 and 2
- 7 is connected to 0, 2, and 8
- 8 is connected to 3 and 7
- 9 is connected to 0 and 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 7: 1 3-star

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is 2.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (7, 9)> 

This analysis includes all possible 3-stars based on the given graph structure.
