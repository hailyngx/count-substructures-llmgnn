Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 2, node 3, and node 4.

For node 2:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 for node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars formed with node 2: [4]
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   <2, (4, 5, 8)>
   <2, (5, 7, 8)>
   <2, (4, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 3 for node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars formed with node 3: [1]
   <3, (0, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 for node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars formed with node 4: [4]
   <4, (0, 2, 6)>
   <4, (0, 2, 6)>
   <4, (0, 2, 6)>
   <4, (0, 2, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4] = [9]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
