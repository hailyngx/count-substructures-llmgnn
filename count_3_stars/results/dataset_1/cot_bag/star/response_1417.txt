Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes could potentially form 3-stars.

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
