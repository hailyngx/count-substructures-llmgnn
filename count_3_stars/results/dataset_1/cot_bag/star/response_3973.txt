Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (with neighbors 2, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 1 (with neighbors 2, 8, 9)
- Node 2 (with neighbors 0, 1, 9)
- Node 4 (with neighbors 5, 6)
- Node 6 (with neighbors 3, 4, 7)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 7, which gives [7].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
