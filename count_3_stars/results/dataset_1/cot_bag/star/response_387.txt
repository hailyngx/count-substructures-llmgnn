Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 7 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 9)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (4, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [74] \]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>
