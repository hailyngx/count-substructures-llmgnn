Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented visually as follows:

```plaintext
      0
     /|\
    / | \
   9--1--2
       | /
       |/
       4--3
       |  |\
       |  | \
       8--7--5
            |
            6
```

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <1, (0, 9, 2)>
    - <1, (0, 9, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 8, 4)>
    - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 3)>
    - <1, (4, 3, 5)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (7, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
