Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 6 ([]).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
