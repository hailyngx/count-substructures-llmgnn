Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. Let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors first.  

- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 5, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 1
- Node 5 neighbors: 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 7 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10 3-stars in the graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- \( <1, 2, 8> \)
- \( <7, 2, 8> \)
- \( <7, 3, 6> \)
- \( <7, 8, 9> \)
