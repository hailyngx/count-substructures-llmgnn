Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (8, 5), (9, 2)]

Now, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 2: 3, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 0, 1 (2 neighbors)
- Node 5: 8 (1 neighbor)
- Node 6: 0, 1 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 5 (1 neighbor)
- Node 9: 2 (1 neighbor)

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the 3-stars formed by each node: 4 + 10 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 3-stars in this graph.
Putting the final number inside brackets: [15]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 0)>
<1, (3, 7, 4)>
<1, (4, 0, 6)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 0, 4)>
