Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars associated with nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star (with nodes 6, 9, 7)
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star (with nodes 0, 7, 5)
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star (with nodes 1, 2, 9)
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star (with nodes 0, 6, 8)

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<2, 6, 9>
<4, 0, 7>
<6, 1, 2>
<9, 0, 8>
