Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph based on the criteria mentioned earlier.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
This results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>

Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5
No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 6, 8
No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 3, 7
No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 4
No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8
This results in \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 7 as the center.
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8
This results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
<8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 8)>, <8,(2, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>

Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 0
No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 8)>, <8,(2, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>.
