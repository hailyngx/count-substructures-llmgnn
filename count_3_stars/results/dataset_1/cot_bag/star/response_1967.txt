Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
