Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
