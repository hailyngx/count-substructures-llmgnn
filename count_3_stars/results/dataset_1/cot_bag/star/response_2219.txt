Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to represent this graph visually so we can identify the 3-stars. Let's draw the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), ( 4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

For node 0: (0, 4, 7), (0, 4, 9) -> 2 3-stars
For node 1: No 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not forming a 3-star)
For node 2: No 3-star (has 3 neighbors but not forming a 3-star)
For node 3: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
For node 4: (4, 0, 7) -> 1 3-star
For node 5: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
For node 6: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors)
For node 7: (7, 0, 4) -> 1 3-star
For node 8: No 3-star (has only 1 neighbor)
For node 9: No 3-star (has 2 neighbors)

Putting the total count inside brackets: [3]  
Unique 3-stars found: <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 9>, <7, 0, 4>
