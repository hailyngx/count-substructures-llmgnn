Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes in this graph with at least 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 23 \) 3-stars. So, the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<0, (1, 8, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 3)>
<1, (2, 7, 5)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>
<2, (7, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 3, 9)>
