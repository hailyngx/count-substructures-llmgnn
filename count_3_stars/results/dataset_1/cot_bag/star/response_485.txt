Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6, 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8, 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10] = 40

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
