Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>,
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (8, 9, 1)>, 
<5, (2, 6, 1)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<8, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 8)>.
