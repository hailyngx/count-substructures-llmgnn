Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors.

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
So, Node 0 contributes 1 3-star.

For Node 1: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, Node 1 contributes 4 3-stars.

For Node 2: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
Node 2 contributes 1 3-star.

For Node 6: 
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
Node 6 contributes 20 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is calculated by summing up these individual contributions:
\[ 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 26 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 0)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>

<1, (6, 8, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
