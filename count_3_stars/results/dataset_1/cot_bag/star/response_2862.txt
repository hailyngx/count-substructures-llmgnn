Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 9 neighbors
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 0 and Node 6 have 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Nodes 0 and 6 have exactly 3 neighbors each, so they each form only 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 84 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 2 = 135 \).

So, the answer is [135] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
