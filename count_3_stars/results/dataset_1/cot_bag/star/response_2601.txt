Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we find there are \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 58 \) total 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 1, 4)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 0, 3)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
