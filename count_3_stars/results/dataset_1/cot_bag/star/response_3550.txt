Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 5

We can see that nodes 0 and 9 have a degree of 5, which means they have at least three neighbors and can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 0:
- \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

For node 9:
- \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

So the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 = 20. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
