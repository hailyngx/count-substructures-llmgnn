Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 6, 8

By calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have three or more neighbors, we find:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

In total, there are [4] 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
