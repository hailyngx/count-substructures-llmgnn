Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 0, 6)>

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = 0 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = 0 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 2)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = 0 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38
