Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 1.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 2.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 10] = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>,
<2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>,
<3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>.

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
