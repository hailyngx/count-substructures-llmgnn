Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors in the graph are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 6, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Let's list the 3-stars now:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 can form 3 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Summing these up, we get a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
