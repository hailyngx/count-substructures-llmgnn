Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

0: 4, 8  
1: 7, 8, 9  
2: 3  
3: 2, 4, 8, 9  
4: 0, 3, 6  
5: 7  
6: 4, 7  
7: 1, 5, 6  
8: 0, 1, 3, 9  
9: 1, 3, 8  

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \):

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [12]. The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (7, 8, 9)>  
<3, (2, 4, 8)>  
<3, (2, 4, 9)>  
<3, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (4, 7, 6)>  
<4, (0, 3, 6)>  
<7, (1, 5, 6)>  
<8, (0, 1, 3)>  
<8, (0, 1, 9)>  
<8, (1, 3, 9)>  
<8, (0, 3, 9)>  
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
