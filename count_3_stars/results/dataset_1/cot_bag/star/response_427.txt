Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph using the given information:

```
         1
         |
0 - 5 - 7 - 9 - 2
|       |     |
4       8     |
|             |
3 - 6 - 9 --- 3
```

Next, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors and can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 3) + 20 (from node 9) = 21. 

Therefore, the answer is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (6, 9, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
