Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each such node.
  
Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, but one of them is not connected back, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (2, 5, 6, 9). It can form 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5, 7). It can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (1, 2, 3, 7, 8). It can form 1 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 7)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (3, 5, 6, 8). It can form 1 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (0, 4, 5, 7). It can form 1 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 5)>.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor and cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <1, (2, 5, 6)>.
