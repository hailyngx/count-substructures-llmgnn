Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
