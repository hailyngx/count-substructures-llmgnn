Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph and their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 4

Let's analyze each node to see if they can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 4, 5>, <2, 3, 4, 7>, <3, 0, 2, 4>, <3, 4, 8, 9>, <4, 0, 2, 3>, <5, 0, 3, 6>, <5, 0, 3, 4>, <5, 3, 4, 6>, <5, 3, 4, 8>, <5, 3, 4, 9>.
