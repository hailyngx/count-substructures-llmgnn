Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (3, 5), (4, 8), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 7), (7, 9), (8, 4), (9, 7)]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
