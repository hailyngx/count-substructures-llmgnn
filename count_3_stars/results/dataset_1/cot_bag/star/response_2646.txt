Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are no 3-stars originating from nodes 3, 5, and 8 because they have less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [35 + 4 + 4] = [43] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
