Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3-stars formed with 0 as the center: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: 3-stars formed with 1 as the center: [inom{1}{3}] = 0
- Node 2: 3-stars formed with 2 as the center: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars formed with 3 as the center: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 4: 3-stars formed with 4 as the center: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: 3-stars formed with 6 as the center: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: 3-stars formed with 7 as the center: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: 3-stars formed with 8 as the center: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars formed with 9 as the center: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (8, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (8, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
