Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the nodes and their connections in the graph are as follows:

Node 0 is connected to node 5.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, hence can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 +1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 28 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows: 

<1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 1)>, <5, (6, 9, 3)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>.
