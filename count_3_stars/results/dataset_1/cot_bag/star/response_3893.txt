Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 7
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 7

Nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up.

For node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Adding these up: 35 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 8) + 35 (from node 9) = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 78, and they are:
<[1, (0, 3, 9)]>, <[1, (2, 4, 6)]>, <[1, (2, 4, 8)]>, <[1, (2, 4, 9)]>, <[1, (2, 6, 9)]>, <[1, (3, 0, 9)]>, <[1, (3, 2, 8)]>, <[1, (3, 8, 9)]>, <[1, (4, 1, 9)]>, <[1, (6, 1, 9)]>, <[3, (0, 1, 9)]>, <[3, (1, 2, 9)]>, <[3, (8, 1, 9)]>, <[8, (1, 3, 9)]>, <[9, (1, 3, 8)]>.
