Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
Node 0 and node 7 have only 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: 1 3-star (as it only has 3 neighbors)
For node 4: 1 3-star (as it only has 3 neighbors)
For node 6: 1 3-star (as it only has 3 neighbors)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 0: 1 3-star (as it only has 3 neighbors)
For node 7: 1 3-star (as it only has 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 19

So, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
