Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5, 7)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 9)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44]. 

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
