Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

Nodes with at least three neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5

1. Node 0:
   - Neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
   - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - Neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8
   - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 6)>

3. Node 3:
   - Neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 9
   - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 9)>

4. Node 5:
   - Neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
   - Total 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 38 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [38]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>.
