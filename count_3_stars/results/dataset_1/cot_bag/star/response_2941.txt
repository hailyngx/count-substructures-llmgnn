Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 5. It forms 1 3-star. 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 6. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, and 8. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, and 8. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 6. It doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 3. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 7. It forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 6. It doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 3. It doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 9 doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12 \).

So, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, and <6, (1, 4, 7)>.
