Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
There are 5 neighbors of node 0, which results in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 8: 
There are 4 neighbors of node 8, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 9: 
There are 6 neighbors of node 9, which results in \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 3)>
<0, (8, 9, 4)>
<0, (8, 9, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
