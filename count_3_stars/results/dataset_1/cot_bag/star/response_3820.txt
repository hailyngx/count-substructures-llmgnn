Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, there are a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 24 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
