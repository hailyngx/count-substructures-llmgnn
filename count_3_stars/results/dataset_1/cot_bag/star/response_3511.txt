Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list those nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 7
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>

So, the final answer is [7].
