Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34]. 

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 3, 8>
- <1, 0, 2, 7>
- <1, 0, 3, 6>
- <1, 0, 4, 7>
- <1, 2, 5, 8>
- <1, 2, 5, 6>
- <1, 2, 7, 6>
- <1, 3, 7, 0>
- <2, 1, 5, 8>
- <2, 1, 7, 6>
- <5, 2, 6, 8>
- <7, 1, 3, 0>
- <8, 0, 5, 9>
- <8, 0, 9, 2>
- <8, 2, 5, 9>
- <9, 0, 4, 8>
