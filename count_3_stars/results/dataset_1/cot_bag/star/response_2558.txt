Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will look for nodes with three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8

For node 0: This node has neighbors 6, 7, 8. So, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 0. 
For node 1: This node has neighbors 3, 4, 7. So, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 1. 
For node 3: This node has neighbors 1, 2, 5, 7. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3. 
For node 4: This node has neighbors 1, 5, 6, 8, 9. So, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4. 
For node 8: This node has neighbors 0, 2, 4. So, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 8. 

Adding all the 3-stars formed with nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 8 together, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 17 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.
