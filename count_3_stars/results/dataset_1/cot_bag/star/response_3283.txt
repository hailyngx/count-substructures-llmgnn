Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: In this case, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 1: In this case, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 2: In this case, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 3: In this case, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 4: In this case, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 8: In this case, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 9: In this case, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 3-stars.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 4)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
