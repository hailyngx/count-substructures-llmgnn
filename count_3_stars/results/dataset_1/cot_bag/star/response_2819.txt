Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 5, 7, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9} (degree 6)
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4} (degree 4)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 32. So, the final answer is [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 9)>
