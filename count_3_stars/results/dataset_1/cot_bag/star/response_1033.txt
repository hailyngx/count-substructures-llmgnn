Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9)
Node 2: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8)
Node 4: 2 neighbors (6, 8)
Node 6: 2 neighbors (2, 4)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9)
Node 9: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: No 3-star
Node 6: No 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>.
