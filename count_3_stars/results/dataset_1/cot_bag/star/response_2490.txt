Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their respective neighbors are:
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 1 neighbor
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 6 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 56\)

Putting the final number inside brackets: [56]
