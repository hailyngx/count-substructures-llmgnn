Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars within it.

Let's list the nodes with their neighbors to make it easier to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [14]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
