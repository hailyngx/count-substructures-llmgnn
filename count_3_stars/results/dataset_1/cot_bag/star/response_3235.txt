Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, node 5, node 8, and node 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, and 9.
- There is only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 7, 9)>.

Now, let's consider node 5:
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 8.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. It's not necessary to list them all, but the count is 20.

Moving on to node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, and 9.
- There is only 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (5, 7, 9)>.

Lastly, node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, and 8.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated:
4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 30.

Therefore, there are a total of 30 3-stars in this graph. So the final result is [30].
