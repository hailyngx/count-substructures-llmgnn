Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7)
Node 3: 3 neighbors (6, 8)
Node 4: 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9)
Node 6: 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7, 9)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 4)
Node 8: 2 neighbors (3, 5)
Node 9: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6)

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 3 3-stars
Node 6: 6 3-stars
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 14 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 7)>
<3, (6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 5, 2)>
