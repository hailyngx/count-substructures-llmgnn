Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the neighbors of each node to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
  - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: $ \binom{7}{3} = 35 $

- Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 8
  - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
  - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5
  - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
  - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $

- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5
  - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
  - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9
  - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 8
  - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: $[35 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [45]$

Unique 3-stars present in the graph: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>
