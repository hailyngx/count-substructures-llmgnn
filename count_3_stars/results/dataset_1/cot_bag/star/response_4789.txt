Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <1, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (7, 4, 2)>

- Node 2: No 3-stars formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (1, 6, 0)>
  - <3, (1, 8, 2)>
  - <3, (6, 0, 3)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (1, 2, 4)>
  - <7, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <7, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <7, (4, 2, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (1, 2, 3)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <8, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <8, (3, 6, 0)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16, which should be written inside brackets as [16].
