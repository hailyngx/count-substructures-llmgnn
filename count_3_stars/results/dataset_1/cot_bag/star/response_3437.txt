Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 4 choose 3 = 4)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 4 choose 3 = 4)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 4 choose 3 = 4)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 4 choose 3 = 4)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (3-stars: 5 choose 3 = 10)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3-stars: 4 choose 3 = 4)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
