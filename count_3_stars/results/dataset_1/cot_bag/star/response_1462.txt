Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

1: 2, 4, 5
2: 1, 6, 7, 8
3: 6
4: 1
5: 1, 9
6: 2, 3, 7
7: 2, 6
8: 2, 9
9: 5, 8

Node 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9 have more than 3 neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>

Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>

Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 8 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Node 9 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the 3-stars found, we get a total of [1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 6 3-stars in the graph.
