Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 1, node 3, node 4, node 5, node 8, and node 9.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 1.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 3.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars around node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 5.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 8.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star around node 9.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 49 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
