Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, we will find the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 16 \).
So, the answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
