Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the total number of 3-stars and identify them.

First, let's list the nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3} + inom{2}{3} + inom{2}{3}] = [1 + 0 + 0] = 1
- Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [inom{2}{3} + inom{2}{3}] = [0 + 0] = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1, and the unique 3-star is <6, (2, 3, 9)>.

Putting this final number inside brackets: [1].
