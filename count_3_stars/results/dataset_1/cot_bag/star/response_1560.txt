Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors, as these are the nodes that can form 3-stars.

The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up:
Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 58

So, there are a total of 58 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<[1, 4, 9], [4, 1, 2], [6, 0, 7], [8, 3, 5], [9, 6, 7]> 

Therefore, the final answer is [58].
