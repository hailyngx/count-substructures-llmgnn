Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2

Let's now find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 4: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 4, and 8: <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 6, and 7: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3]
