Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9.

For node 0, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
For node 3, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 4, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 6, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 9, there are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = 33.

The unique 3-stars are:
