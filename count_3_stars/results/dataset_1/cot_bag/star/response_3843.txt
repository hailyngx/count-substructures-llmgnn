Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: C(2, 3) = 1
- Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1

Thus, there are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<(2, 5, 6), 4>
<(2, 5, 6), 7>
<(2, 5, 6), 8>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<(6, 7, 8), 4>
<(6, 7, 8), 2>
<(6, 7, 8), 5>
<(6, 7, 8), 9>
