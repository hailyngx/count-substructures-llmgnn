Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, there are a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 7>
<3, 0, 7>
<7, 2, 8>
<9, 1, 6>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <0, 5, 7>, <3, 0, 7>, <7, 2, 8>, and <9, 1, 6>.
