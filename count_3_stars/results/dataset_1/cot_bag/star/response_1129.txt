Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9  
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 6, 9  
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 9  
Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9  
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6  

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:  
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23 \) 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [23].  

Let's list out the unique 3-stars found:  
<1, (4, 5, 7)>  
<1, (4, 5, 9)>  
<1, (4, 7, 9)>  
<1, (5, 7, 9)>  
<1, (4, 7, 9)>  
<1, (2, 4, 7)>  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>  
<1, (2, 5, 7)>  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>  
<3, (2, 6, 9)>  
<4, (6, 5, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 5, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 7)>  
<6, (3, 4, 9)>  
<6, (3, 5, 9)>  
<6, (3, 4, 5)>  
<6, (3, 4, 9)>  
<9, (1, 4, 6)>  
<9, (1, 3, 6)>  
<9, (1, 3, 4)>  
<9, (1, 3, 9)>
