Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
2. Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
3. Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
4. Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 5, 9)>

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
