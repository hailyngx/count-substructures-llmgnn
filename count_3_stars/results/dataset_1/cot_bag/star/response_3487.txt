Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. 

For each of these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars formed:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
3. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star)
4. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star)
5. Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
6. Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are a total of 2 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>

Putting this final count inside brackets, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
