Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9)
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (5, 8)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 7)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [16]

Unique 3-stars:

<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
