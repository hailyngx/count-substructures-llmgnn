Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
