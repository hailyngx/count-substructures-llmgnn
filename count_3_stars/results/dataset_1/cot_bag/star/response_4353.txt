Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a few nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors.

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8).
For node 2, there are 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7, 9).
For node 5, there are 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8, 9).
For node 8, there are 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7).
For node 9, there are 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28

So, there are 28 3-stars in this graph, represented by the unique sets of nodes:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
