Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 8.

For node 0:
It has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

For node 1:
It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 4:
It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 5:
It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 8:
It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are [42] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 5, 8>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <7, 6, 8>
