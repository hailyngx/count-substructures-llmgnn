Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 \)

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>
