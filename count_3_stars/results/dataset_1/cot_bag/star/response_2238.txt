Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 29 \).
