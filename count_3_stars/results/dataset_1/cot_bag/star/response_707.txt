Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 1: Since it has 2 neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.
2. Node 2: It forms 1 3-star with itself as the central node: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. Node 3: Since it has only 1 neighbor, it does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 4: Since it has 2 neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 6: It forms 1 3-star with itself as the central node: <6, (2, 4, 8)>
6. Node 7: It forms 1 3-star with itself as the central node: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
7. Node 8: It forms 1 3-star with itself as the central node: <8, (2, 6, 9)>
8. Node 9: Since it has 2 neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1] and the unique 3-star is <2, (1, 3, 6)>.
