Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph using the given nodes and edges:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|    |    |
9 -- 3    5
     |    |
     6 -- 8
     |
     7
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [19] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <1, 0, 2>
- <1, 0, 3>
- <1, 0, 4>
- <1, 0, 8>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <3, 2, 5>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 8>
- <8, 4, 5>
- <9, 0, 3>
