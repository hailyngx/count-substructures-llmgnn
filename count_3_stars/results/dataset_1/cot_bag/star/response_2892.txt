Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 60

So, there are [60] total 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
