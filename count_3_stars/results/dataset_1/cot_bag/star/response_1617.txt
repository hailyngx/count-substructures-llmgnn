Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first analyze each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 8, 9).
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7).
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8).
- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9).
- Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (3, 8, 9).
- Node 5: It has 2 neighbors (1, 9).
- Node 6: It has 1 neighbor (7).
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors (1, 6).
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4).
- Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5).

Now let's count the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: 1 3-star.
- Node 3: 1 3-star.
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
