Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on the given edges:
Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 7
Node 1: 4, 8
Node 2: 0, 4
Node 3: 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 8
Node 5: 3, 9
Node 6: 0, 3
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 1, 4, 9
Node 9: 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. Hence, the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 4)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
