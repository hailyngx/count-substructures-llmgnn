Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 4. 

For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 6, 7)>

For node 1:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3] and they are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, and <4, (5, 8, 9)>.
