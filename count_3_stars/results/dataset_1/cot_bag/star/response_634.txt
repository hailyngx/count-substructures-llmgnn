Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we can first identify which nodes have at least 3 neighbors. Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 8, and Node 7 have 7, 6, 5, 4, 6, and 3 neighbors respectively, meeting the criteria to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 35 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 90

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [90].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

So, the unique 3-stars in this graph are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
