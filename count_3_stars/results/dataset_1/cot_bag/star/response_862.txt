Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- From Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 5)>

- From Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 7)>

- From Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <4, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 5)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 4] = 12. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
