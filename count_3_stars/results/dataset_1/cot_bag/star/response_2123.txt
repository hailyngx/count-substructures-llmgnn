Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars each such node can form. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [11].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 0, 8)>
- <3, (5, 1, 8)>
- <3, (5, 8, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <5, (3, 8, 6)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
