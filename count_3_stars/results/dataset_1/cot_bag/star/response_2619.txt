Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {8}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 10 + 4] = 18.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>
