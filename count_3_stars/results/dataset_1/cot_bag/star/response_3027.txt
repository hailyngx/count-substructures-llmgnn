Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (6, 7, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 14.

So, the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
