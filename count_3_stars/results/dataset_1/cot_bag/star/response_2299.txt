Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the given information.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
- As Node 2 has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star with node 2 as the center.

Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
- As Node 3 has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.

Node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
- As Node 6 has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9] \)

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)> 

So, the final result is: \([9]\)
