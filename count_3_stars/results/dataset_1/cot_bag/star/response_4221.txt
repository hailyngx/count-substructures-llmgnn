Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the specified edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 3), (8, 3), (9, 1), (9, 3)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 6
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 5
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 3
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
For Node 4: Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed
For Node 6: Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed
For Node 9: Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
