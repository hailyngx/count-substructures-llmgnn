Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are given as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:  
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: [ ] inom{3}{3} = 1 
- Node 2: [ ] inom{4}{3} = 4 
- Node 3: [ ] inom{5}{3} = 10 
- Node 4: [ ] inom{5}{3} = 10 
- Node 5: [ ] inom{4}{3} = 4 
- Node 7: [ ] inom{5}{3} = 10 
- Node 8: [ ] inom{4}{3} = 4 

Now, we add up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 43

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
