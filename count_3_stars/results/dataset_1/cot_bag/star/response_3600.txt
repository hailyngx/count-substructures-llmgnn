Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's check each node to see if it can form any 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 3: Forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 4: Forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 5: Forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 7: Forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 9: Forms 2 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [1 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2] = 16.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 8, 0)>, 
<1, (2, 1, 3)>,
<1, (4, 1, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<3, (6, 3, 7)>, 
<4, (7, 1, 9)>, 
<5, (6, 8, 5)>, 
<7, (4, 1, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (4, 7, 8)>.
