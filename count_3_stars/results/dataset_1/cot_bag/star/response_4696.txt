Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the 3-stars, we first need to determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here is the list of nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 17.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>
