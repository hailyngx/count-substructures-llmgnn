Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 20 \]

So, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>
