Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the edges are given. Let's construct the graph first:

```
     1 -- 4 -- 6
     |    | /  /|
     5 -- 3 -- 8
    /|    |    |
   9 2    0    7
```

We have the following nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5 has neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6 has neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7 has neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 9 has neighbors {5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with the above nodes:
- For Node 4: 1 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
