Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 8

We see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors and hence can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<1, (0, 9, 7)>

Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<3, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 11.
