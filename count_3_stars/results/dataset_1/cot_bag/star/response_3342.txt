Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 7
Node 1: 7, 9
Node 2: 4, 5, 6
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2, 7
Node 6: 2, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
Node 8: 7
Node 9: 1, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [0 3-stars]
- Node 1: [0 3-stars]
- Node 2: [(2, 4, 5)]
- Node 3: [0 3-stars]
- Node 4: [0 3-stars]
- Node 5: [0 3-stars]
- Node 6: [0 3-stars]
- Node 7: [(7, 1, 5)], [(7, 6, 2)]
- Node 8: [0 3-stars]
- Node 9: [0 3-stars]

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 7)>
