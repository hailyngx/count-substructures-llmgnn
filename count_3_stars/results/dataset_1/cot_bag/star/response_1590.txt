Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:  
Node 0: 3, 8  
Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 8  
Node 2: 4, 5, 6  
Node 3: 0, 1, 4  
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9  
Node 5: 2, 7, 9  
Node 6: 2  
Node 7: 1, 5  
Node 8: 0, 1  
Node 9: 4, 5  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (3, 4, 7)>  
<1, (3, 4, 8)>  
<1, (3, 7, 8)>  
<1, (4, 7, 8)>  
<2, (4, 5, 6)>  
<4, (1, 2, 3)>  
<4, (1, 3, 9)>  
<4, (2, 3, 9)>  
<4, (3, 9, 5)>  
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
