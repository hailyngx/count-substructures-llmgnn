Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 35 + 0 + 10 + 4 = 67  

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [67].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<1, (3, 5, 8)>  
<1, (4, 5, 7)>  
<1, (5, 7, 8)>  
<1, (5, 8, 9)>  
<(3, 5, 7), 1>  
<(3, 5, 8), 1>  
<(4, 5, 7), 1>  
<(4, 5, 8), 1>  
<(5, 7, 8), 1>  
<(5, 7, 9), 1>  
<(5, 8, 9), 1>  
<5, (7, 8, 9)>  

(The order of nodes in a 3-star doesn't matter, so some combinations may appear multiple times in different orderings.)
