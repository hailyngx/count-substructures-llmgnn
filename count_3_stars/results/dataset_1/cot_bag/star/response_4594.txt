Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 35 + 4 = 68

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
