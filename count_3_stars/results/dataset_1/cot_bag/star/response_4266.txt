Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list them:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 5, 9} => [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars]
<0, (2, 4, 5)> <0, (2, 4, 9)> <0, (2, 5, 9)> <0, (3, 4, 5)> <0, (3, 4, 9)> 
<0, (3, 5, 9)> <0, (4, 5, 9)> <0, (2, 5, 3)> <0, (4, 6, 9)> <0, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8} => [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars]
<2, (0, 5, 6)> <2, (0, 5, 7)> <2, (0, 6, 7)> <2, (0, 7, 8)> <2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)> <2, (5, 7, 8)> <2, (6, 7, 8)> <2, (3, 5, 6)> <2, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 6} => [Only 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 6)>]

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 6, 9} => [Only 1 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 9)>]

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 6} => [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
<5, (0, 2, 3)> <5, (0, 2, 6)> <5, (0, 3, 6)> <5, (2, 3, 6)>

- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} => [\( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20 3-stars]
<6, (2, 3, 4)> <6, (2, 3, 5)> <6, (2, 3, 7)> <6, (2, 3, 9)> <6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)> <6, (2, 4, 9)> <6, (2, 5, 7)> <6, (2, 5, 9)> <6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)> <6, (3, 4, 7)> <6, (3, 4, 9)> <6, (3, 5, 7)> <6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)> <6, (4, 5, 7)> <6, (4, 5, 9)> <6, (4, 7, 9)> <6, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 6} => [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars]
<9, (0, 4, 6)> <9, (4, 6, 2)> <9, (4, 6, 5)> <9, (6, 2, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4] = 50
