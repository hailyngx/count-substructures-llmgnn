Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 45

So, there are 45 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>.

Putting the final count in brackets: [45]
