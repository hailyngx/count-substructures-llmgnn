Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: node 0, node 2, and node 7.

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 7:
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
