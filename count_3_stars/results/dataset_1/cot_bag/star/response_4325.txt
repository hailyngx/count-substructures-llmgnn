Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Let's check how many neighbors each node has:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- For node 0, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 2, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 5, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up these results, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 7, 9>
