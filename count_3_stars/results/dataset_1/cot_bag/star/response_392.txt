Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

From the given edges, we can determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up:
1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
