Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
    0 --- 6
    |     |
    |     |
    6 --- 4
     \   /
      2 
     / \
    1   5
     \ / 
      9
```

We can see that nodes 2, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors, making them potential centers of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2:
There are 4 possible combinations of 3 neighbors out of its 4 neighbors. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
These 3-stars are: <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>.

For node 6:
There are 5 possible combinations of 3 neighbors out of its 5 neighbors. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.  
These 3-stars are: <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>.

For node 9:
There are 5 possible combinations of 3 neighbors out of its 5 neighbors. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.  
These 3-stars are: <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 4)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [24]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>,
<6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>,
<9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 4)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>.
