Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0 and 5.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 20 = 30].
