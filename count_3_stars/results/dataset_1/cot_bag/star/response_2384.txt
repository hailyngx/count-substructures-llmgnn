Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 5, and 9.

For node 1, it has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8, 9), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 1 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>.

For node 5, it has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), so only 1 3-star is formed with node 5. The unique 3-star is <5, (4, 7, 9)>.

For node 9, it has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). The unique 3-stars are <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 = 15. Thus, the answer is [15].
