Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 7} (degree 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is  [22]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
