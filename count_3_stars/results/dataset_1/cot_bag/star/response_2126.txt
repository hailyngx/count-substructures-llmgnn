Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8 since they have three or more neighbors:

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 6)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 8, 6)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (7, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 6, 5)>, <4, (7, 6, 8)>

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 6)>, <7, (4, 8, 1)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 1)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [19].
