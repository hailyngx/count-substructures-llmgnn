Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 22

So, there are 22 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [22].
