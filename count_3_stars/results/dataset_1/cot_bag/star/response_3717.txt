Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, there are 11 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[0, 6, 8], [4, 2, 7], [4, 2, 8], [4, 2, 9], [4, 7, 8], [4, 7, 9], [4, 8, 9], [6, 0, 3], [6, 0, 5], [6, 3, 7], [6, 5, 7]> 

So the final answer is [11].
