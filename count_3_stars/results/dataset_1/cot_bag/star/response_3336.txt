Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 38 edges in the graph. Let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: Has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 1: Has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars  
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 2)>

Node 3: Has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 4: Has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars  
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<4, (9, 5, 2)>
<4, (9, 5, 8)>

Node 8: Has 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars  
<8, (1, 9, 2)>
<8, (2, 9, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
<8, (9, 5, 2)>
<8, (9, 5, 4)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 9)>

Node 9: Has 6 neighbors -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars  
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
<9, (5, 2, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (8, 5, 2)>
<9, (8, 5, 4)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>
<9, (8, 5, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20] = 68.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
