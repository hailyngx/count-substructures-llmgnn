Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star
- Node 2: Only 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: Only 1 3-star
- Node 9: Only 1 3-star

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 32 \)

So, there are 32 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (8, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 5, 0)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (8, 1, 2)>
<6, (8, 2, 1)>
<6, (2, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (5, 0, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)> 

So, the final answer is [32].
