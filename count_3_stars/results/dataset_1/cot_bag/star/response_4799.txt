Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (with neighbors 2, 4, 9)
- Node 2 (with neighbors 0, 1, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 4 (with neighbors 0, 8, 9)
- Node 5 (with neighbors 1, 2, 3, 8)
- Node 8 (with neighbors 2, 4, 5, 7)

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 20

So, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 5)>
<2, (8, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 1, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 2, 1)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<8, (5, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 2, 7)>
<8, (7, 5, 2)>
