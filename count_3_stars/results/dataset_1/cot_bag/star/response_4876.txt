Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula mentioned earlier:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star formed
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: No 3-star formed
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: No 3-star formed
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10]

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 47

So, the final answer is [47].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
