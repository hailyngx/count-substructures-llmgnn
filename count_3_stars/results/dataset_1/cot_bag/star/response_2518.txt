Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 7, 8)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (2, 5, 9)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 3, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (7, 8)>, <2, (5, 9)>, <4, (3, 9)>.
