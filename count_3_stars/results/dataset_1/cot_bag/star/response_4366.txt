Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:  
Node 0: 1, 8  
Node 1: 0, 9  
Node 2: 6  
Node 4: 6, 9  
Node 5: 9  
Node 6: 2, 4  
Node 8: 0, 9  
Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 8  
Node 3, 7: No neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars:  
Total = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 4  

Thus, there are 4 3-stars in the given graph.  

<1, 4, 9>, <6, 4, 9>, <8, 9, 1>, <9, 4, 6>
