Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We first construct the graph:

```
    0 -- 2
    |    | \
    |    |  4
    |    |  |
    3 -- 7  5
          \ |
            6
            |
            1
            |
            8 -- 9
```

Looking at the nodes, node 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we have a total of 12 3-stars. So, the answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 9, 7)>
- <8, (9, 7, 1)>
