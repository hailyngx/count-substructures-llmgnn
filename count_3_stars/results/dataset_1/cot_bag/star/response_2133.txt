Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors.

For this graph, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 4, 6, 7)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 13 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 4)>
