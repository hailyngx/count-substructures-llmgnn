Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph. Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed with it:

- Node 1: Only 2 neighbors (2 neighbors < 3), so no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 2: Only 1 neighbor (1 neighbor < 3), so no 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, thus 1 3-star can be formed. [1]
   - <3, (5, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, thus 1 3-star can be formed. [1]
   - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, thus 4 3-stars can be formed. [4]
   - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
   - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, thus 1 3-star can be formed. [1]
   - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, thus 1 3-star can be formed. [1]
   - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, thus 4 3-stars can be formed. [4]
   - <8, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <8, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <8, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, thus 4 3-stars can be formed. [4]
   - <9, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (7, 8, 5)>
   - <9, (6, 8, 5)>
   - <9, (6, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].  
The unique 3-stars are: <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 5)>, <9, (6, 8, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 5)>.
