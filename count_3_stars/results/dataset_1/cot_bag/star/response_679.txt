Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7  
Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8  
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8  
Node 3: 2, 9  
Node 4: 0  
Node 6: 1, 2, 8  
Node 7: 0, 1  
Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 9  
Node 9: 3, 8  

We will now count the number of 3-stars using the method described earlier.

For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)> → 2 3-stars  
For Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)> → 3 3-stars  
For Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)> → 3 3-stars  
For Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)> → 4 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars: [2 + 3 + 3 + 4] = [12]  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>,  
<1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>,  
<2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>,  
<8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>
