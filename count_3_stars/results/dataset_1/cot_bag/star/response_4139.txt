Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 1, 4, 6, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up these counts, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 37 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is represented as [37].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
