Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>
