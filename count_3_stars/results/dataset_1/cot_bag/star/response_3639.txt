Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's find the total number of 3-stars.

We will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:    
Node 0 has 2 neighbors.    
Node 1 has 1 neighbor.    
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.    
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.    
Node 4 has 5 neighbors.    
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.    
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.    
Node 7 has 3 neighbors.    
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.    
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.    

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:    
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star    
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars    
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars    
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star    
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars    
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star    
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars    

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:    
1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 31    

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:    
<2, (4, 6, 9)>    
<3, (4, 6, 9)>    
<4, (3, 6, 9)>    
<4, (5, 6, 8)>    
<6, (3, 4, 9)>    
<6, (4, 5, 7)>    
<6, (4, 7, 9)>    
<6, (5, 7, 9)>    
<6, (7, 8, 9)>    
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
