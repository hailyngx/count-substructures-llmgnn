Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 0: There are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 1: There are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 2: There are 2 neighbors.
For node 3: There are 2 neighbors.
For node 6: There are 2 neighbors.
For node 8: There are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 9: There are 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>
