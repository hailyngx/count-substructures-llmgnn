Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first build the graph structure based on the provided edges. 

The graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.

Now, we will find the 3-stars in this graph by checking each node with three or more neighbors.

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 6, 7)>.
2. Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
3. Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
4. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
5. Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 
   <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, and <6, (1, 7, 9)>.
7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center: 
   <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, and <7, (1, 6, 9)>.
8. Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
9. Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) = 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
