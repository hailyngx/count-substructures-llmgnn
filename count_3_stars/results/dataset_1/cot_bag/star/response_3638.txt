Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8  
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1  
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 2 - we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>

For Node 3 - we have 1 3-star
<3, (0, 1, 2)>

For Node 6 - we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>

Adding these up, we have a total of 15 3-stars:
[15]  
<2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>
