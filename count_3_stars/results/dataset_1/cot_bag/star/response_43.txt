Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>.
