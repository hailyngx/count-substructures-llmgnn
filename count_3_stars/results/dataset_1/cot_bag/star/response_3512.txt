Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \( 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
