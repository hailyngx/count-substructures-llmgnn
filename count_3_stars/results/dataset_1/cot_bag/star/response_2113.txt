Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
