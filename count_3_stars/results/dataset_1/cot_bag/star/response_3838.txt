Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Now, let's calculate 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1]
- Node 2: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1]
- Node 7: [\[ \binom{4}{3} \] = 4]
- Node 8: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
