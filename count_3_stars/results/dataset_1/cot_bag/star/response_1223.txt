Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 8}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9: Neighbors {6, 8}, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 5)>
<1, (5, 6)>
<2, (0, 8)>
<5, (0, 1)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 9)>
<9, (6, 8)>
