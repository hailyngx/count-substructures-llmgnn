Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 24


So, there are 24 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>


So, there are [24] unique 3-stars in the graph.
