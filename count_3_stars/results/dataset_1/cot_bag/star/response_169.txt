Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, there are 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, 7), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 2, there are 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 6), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 3, there are 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 5, 7), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, there are 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 5, there are 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, there are 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, there are 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 4, 5), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, there are 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [20] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20] \), and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>.
