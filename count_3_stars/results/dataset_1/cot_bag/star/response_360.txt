Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of those nodes.

Let's go through the nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, and 8.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 9.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, and 8.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, and 6.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, and 8.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 9.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of the individual counts: 
\[ [ 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 ] = 15 \]

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
