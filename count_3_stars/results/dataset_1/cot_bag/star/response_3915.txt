Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are node 3, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [56 + 20 + 4] = 80 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
