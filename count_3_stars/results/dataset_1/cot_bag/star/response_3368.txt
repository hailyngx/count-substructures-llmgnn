Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Edges:
- 1 is connected to 4
- 2 is connected to 4 and 9
- 3 is connected to 4 and 6
- 4 is connected to 1, 2, 3, and 9
- 5 is connected to 6 and 7
- 6 is connected to 3, 5, 7, and 9
- 7 is connected to 5, 6, and 8
- 8 is connected to 7 and 9
- 9 is connected to 2, 4, 6, and 8

To find the total number of 3-stars, we look at each node:
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
  - <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
  - <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we have [12].
