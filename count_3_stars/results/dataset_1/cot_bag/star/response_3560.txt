Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:  

- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least three neighbors or more:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up, we get a total of [4] 3-stars.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
