Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, here is the analysis to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors (6, 9)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (7, 9)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (7, 8)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (1, 5)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node and then find the total count of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Putting it all together, we have a total of [5] 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
