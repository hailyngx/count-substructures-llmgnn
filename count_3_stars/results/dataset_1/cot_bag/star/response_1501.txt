Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 0, 3)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (5, 0, 4)>
- <0, (5, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
