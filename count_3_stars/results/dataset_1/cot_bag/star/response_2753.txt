Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Considering the given information, the graph can be illustrated as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: Forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: Forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Other nodes have less than 3 neighbors and do not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node: \( 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].        

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
