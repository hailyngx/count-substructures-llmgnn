Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first list out the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors (1, 2, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 1: Neighbors (0, 6)
- Node 2: Neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 3: Neighbors (7, 8)
- Node 4: Neighbors (0, 8, 9)
- Node 5: Neighbors (2)
- Node 6: Neighbors (1, 2)
- Node 7: Neighbors (0, 3)
- Node 8: Neighbors (2, 3, 4)
- Node 9: Neighbors (0, 4)

Now, let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

For node 0, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 2, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, we can form 1 3-star.
For node 8, we can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>
