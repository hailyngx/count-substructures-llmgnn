Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25 \)

Therefore, there are 25 3-stars in the given graph. 

Hence, the answer is [25].

Unique 3-stars:

<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 1, 9)>
<1, (3, 1, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (8, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<3, (5, 0, 8)>
<5, (7, 4, 8)>
<7, (8, 5, 9)>
<8, (7, 4, 5)>
<8, (7, 4, 9)>
<8, (7, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (7, 4, 3)>
<9, (7, 3, 1)>
