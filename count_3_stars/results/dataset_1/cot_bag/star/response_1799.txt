Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8)

Now, let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be constructed:

- Node 0: inom{3}{0} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{2}{0} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{3}{1} = 3 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 0, 2)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (3, 8, 6)>
<6, (7, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (8, 8, 8)>
