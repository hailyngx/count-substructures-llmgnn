Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].
Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
