Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes mentioned:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>
