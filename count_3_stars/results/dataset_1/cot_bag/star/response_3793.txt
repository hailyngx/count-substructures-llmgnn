Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 11.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 9)> 
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

So, the final answer is [11].
