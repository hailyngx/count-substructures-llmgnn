Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 possible 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 possible 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
