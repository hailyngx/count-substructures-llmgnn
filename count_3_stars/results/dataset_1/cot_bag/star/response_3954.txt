Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 6), (3, 7), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 8)]

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 5: <0, (1, 5)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, 8: <6, (2, 5, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 7, 9: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
