Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

For node 0:
There are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors from its 4 neighbors, so [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)] 3-stars are formed.  
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 2:
There are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors from its 5 neighbors, so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)] 3-stars are formed.  
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 4)>

For node 4:
There are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors from its 5 neighbors, so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)] 3-stars are formed.  
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 0)>
<4, (3, 8, 0)>
<4, (2, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 2)>
<4, (2, 0, 3)>

For node 6:
There are 3 ways to choose 3 neighbors from its 3 neighbors, so [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)] 3-stars are formed.  
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 8:
There are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors from its 5 neighbors, so [\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)] 3-stars are formed.  
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 0, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 0)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>

Adding up all the 3-stars formed from each node, we have a total of [\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 35 \)] 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [\[35\]].
