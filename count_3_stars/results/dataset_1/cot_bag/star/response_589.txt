Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 35 + 10 = 53
So, there are 53 3-stars in total.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [53].
