Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 10 = 69

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [69].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are:
