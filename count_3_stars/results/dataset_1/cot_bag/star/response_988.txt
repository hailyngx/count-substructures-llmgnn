Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 9).
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7).
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8).
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 7, 9). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

Unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>.
