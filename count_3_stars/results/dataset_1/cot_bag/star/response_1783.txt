Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 5

We can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will check for 3-stars around these nodes. 

Calculating the 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 8, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding them up, we have a total of [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>
