Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: There are 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
- For node 6: There are 4 neighbors (0, 3, 9, 7), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- For node 7: There are 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- For node 8: There are 6 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5, 7), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38 \]

Putting the final number inside brackets: [38]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
