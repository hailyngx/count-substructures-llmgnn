Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7. 

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, node 5 has 6 neighbors, and node 7 has 6 neighbors. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 61 \) 

Therefore, there are [61] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 2, 3, 5>
- <0, 2, 7, 8>
- <0, 3, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 7, 8>
- <1, 0, 7, 8>
- <5, 4, 6, 7>
- <5, 4, 7, 9>
- <7, 4, 6, 5>
- <7, 4, 6, 0>
- <7, 4, 6, 1>
