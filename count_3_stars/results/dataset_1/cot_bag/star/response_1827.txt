Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with 3 different sets of neighbors: (4, 6, 9), (4, 5, 6), and (6, 7, 9).
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with the set of neighbors (2, 5, 6).
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with the set of neighbors (2, 4, 7).
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with the set of neighbors (4, 8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5. Putting this number inside brackets gives us [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
