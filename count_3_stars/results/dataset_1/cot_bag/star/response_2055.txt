Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 0, 9)>
<4, (1, 0, 2)>
