Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {2, 7, 9}
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {2, 5, 9}
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 6}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 7}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 8}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 7}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15

Thus, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
