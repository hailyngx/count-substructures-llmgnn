Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 25 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>
