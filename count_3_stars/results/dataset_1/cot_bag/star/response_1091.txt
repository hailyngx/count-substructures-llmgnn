Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 8

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
  
For Node 1, there are no 3-stars formed as it has exactly 3 neighbors.

For Node 2, there are 1 possible 3-star: 
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>

For Node 5, there are 1 possible 3-star: 
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>

For Node 8, there is 1 possible 3-star:
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [5].
