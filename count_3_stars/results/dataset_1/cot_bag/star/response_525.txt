Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the information, we construct the following graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0,4), (0,5), (0,7), (0,9), (1,3), (1,6), (1,7), (2,9), (3,1), (3,6), (4,0), (4,6), (5,0), (5,7), (6,1), (6,3), (6,4), (6,8), (7,0), (7,1), (7,5), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (9,0), (9,2)

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming C(4,3) = 4 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming C(4,3) = 4 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 8), <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>

Summing up the 3-stars formed: 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>.
