Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 8, 9)>.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <6, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <9, (2, 3, 5)>
  - <9, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (3, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20 \), so the final answer is [20].
