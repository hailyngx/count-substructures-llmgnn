Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
For each node that has three or more neighbors, we can form a 3-star with that node as the center. 

- Node 1 has neighbors 3, 9 → 1 3-star
- Node 2 has neighbors 3, 6, 7 → 1 3-star
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 2, 5, 8 → 1 3-star
- Node 4 has neighbors 5, 9 → 1 3-star
- Node 5 has neighbors 3, 4, 8 → 1 3-star
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 9 → 1 3-star
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, 7 → 1 3-star

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 9>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 3, 6>
<3, 1, 8>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 3, 8>
<7, 2, 9>
