Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 0: C(3, 3) = 1

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 1: C(3, 3) = 1

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 8. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 2: C(3, 3) = 1

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 3: C(3, 3) = 1

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 4: 0

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 5: C(3, 3) = 1

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 6: C(5, 3) = 10

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 7: C(3, 3) = 1

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 8: 0

- Node 9 has 2 neighbors. 
  Number of 3-stars centered at node 9: 0

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [16]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
