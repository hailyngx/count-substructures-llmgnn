Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
