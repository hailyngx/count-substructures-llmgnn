Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8  
Node 1: 4, 7, 8  
Node 2: 3, 6  
Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8  
Node 4: 0, 1  
Node 5: 0, 9  
Node 6: 2, 3, 7  
Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9  
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9  
Node 9: 5, 7, 8  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 35  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (4, 5, 8)>  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<0, (3, 7, 8)>  
<0, (4, 7, 8)>  
<1, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (6, 7, 8)>  
<3, (7, 8, 9)>  
<7, (8, 9, 5)>  
<8, (9, 7, 5)>  
<8, (9, 7, 0)>
