Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
