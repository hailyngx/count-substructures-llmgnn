Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.

Node 1: (3, 6, 9)
Node 2: (4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
Node 3: (1, 4)
Node 4: (2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
Node 5: (2, 4, 8)
Node 6: (1, 2, 7)
Node 7: (2, 4, 6)
Node 8: (2, 4, 5)
Node 9: (1, 4)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
