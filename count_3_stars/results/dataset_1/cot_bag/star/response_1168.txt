Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we need to first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 7, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<10, (2, 5, 9)>
<11, (4, 3, 5)>
<12, (2, 6, 7)>
<13, (1, 7, 5)>
<14, (0, 1, 8)>
