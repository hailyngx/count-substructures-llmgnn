Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graphs in the given scenario, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, and 7)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 2)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 9, and 2)

We can now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: $inom{3}{3} = 1$
- For node 4: $inom{5}{3} = 10$
- For node 8: $inom{4}{3} = 4$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is $1 + 10 + 4 = 15$.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [15].
