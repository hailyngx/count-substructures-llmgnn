Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 33 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 7, 5)>
- <9, (7, 0, 1)>
