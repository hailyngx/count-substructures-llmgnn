Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4}

Based on the criteria mentioned earlier, we can identify the following 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms 3-star with {2, 7, 8}: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms 3-star with {1, 7, 9}: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 3-star with {3, 7, 9}: <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 3-star with {1, 5, 8}: <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 3-star with {2, 5, 8}: <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 3-star with {2, 8, 9}: <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 3-star with {1, 4, 7}: <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 8 forms 3-star with {5, 7, 8}: <8, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
