Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars from each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Now, summing up the 3-stars from all these nodes, we get \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
