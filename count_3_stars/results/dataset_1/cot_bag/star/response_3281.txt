Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 7

Node 0 has 1 neighbor, node 3 has 1 neighbor, and node 9 has 1 neighbor, so they do not form 3-stars.
Node 1, node 5, and node 9 have 2 neighbors, so they also do not form 3-stars.

Node 2, node 4, node 6, and node 8 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars for node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of 3-stars for node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

So, the final answer is [13].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
