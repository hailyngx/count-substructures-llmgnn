Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 2, 6
Node 1: 0, 3, 9
Node 2: 0, 5
Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 3, 5
Node 5: 2, 4
Node 6: 0, 3
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 1

Let's analyze each node to determine if they form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6. <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3: Forms 2 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, 6 and 1, 4, 8. <3, (1, 4, 6)> and <3, (1, 4, 8)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 2] = 4. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, and <3, (1, 4, 8)>.
