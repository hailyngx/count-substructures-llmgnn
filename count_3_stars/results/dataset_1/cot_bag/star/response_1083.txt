Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4

For the nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 43 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43], and they are: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 0, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (8, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 1, 9)>, <4, (3, 9, 4)>, <4, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>
