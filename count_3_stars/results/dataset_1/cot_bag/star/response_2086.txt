Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7
  Total 3-stars with node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5
  Total 3-stars with node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
  Total 3-stars with node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 10 = 18.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 5, 7>
<0, 3, 5, 8> 
<3, 0, 2, 5>
<3, 0, 4, 5>
<3, 2, 4, 5>
<5, 0, 2, 8>
<5, 0, 3, 8>
<5, 2, 3, 8>
<5, 2, 4, 8> 
<5, 3, 4, 8>
