Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Edges: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 5)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8 (degree: 5)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2 (degree: 2)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 7, 8 (degree: 3)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 5, 6 (degree: 2)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 5 (degree: 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with degree 3 or more:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 = 11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
