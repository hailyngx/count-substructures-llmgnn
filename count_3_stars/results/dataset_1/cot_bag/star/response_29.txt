Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 is connected to: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 1 is connected to: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2 is connected to: {0, 3, 7}
Node 3 is connected to: {0, 1, 2, 8, 9}
Node 4 is connected to: {0, 8}
Node 5 is connected to: {8}
Node 6 is connected to: {0, 1}
Node 7 is connected to: {1, 2}
Node 8 is connected to: {1, 3, 4, 5}
Node 9 is connected to: {1, 3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0: 
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes {2, 3, 4} and {2, 3, 6} -> Total: 2

For Node 1: 
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes {3, 6, 7}, {3, 6, 8}, and {3, 6, 9} -> Total: 3

For Node 3: 
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes {0, 1, 2} and {0, 1, 8} -> Total: 2

Adding these up, we have a total of [2 + 3 + 2] = 7 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
