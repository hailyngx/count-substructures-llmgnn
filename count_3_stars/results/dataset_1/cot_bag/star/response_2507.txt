Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors
- Node 10 has 0 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 27 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [27].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>.
