Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To begin, we can represent the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 9), (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the node degrees to determine which nodes could potentially form 3-stars with three or more neighbors:

Node degrees:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 5

From the degrees, we see that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors, making them candidates for forming 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each candidate node:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final result is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, and <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
