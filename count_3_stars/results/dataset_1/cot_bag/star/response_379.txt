Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
