Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.

Let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9, forming the 3-star configuration <4, (3, 5, 9)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4, forming the 3-star configuration <5, (0, 3, 4)>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6, forming the 3-star configuration <9, (2, 4, 6)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
