Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9) ==> Total 3-stars = [1]
- Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5) ==> Total 3-stars = [0]
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 9) ==> Total 3-stars = [1]
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 8) ==> Total 3-stars = [0]
- Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8) ==> Total 3-stars = [1]
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 9) ==> Total 3-stars = [2]
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 7) ==> Total 3-stars = [0]
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9) ==> Total 3-stars = [1]
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 4) ==> Total 3-stars = [0]
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7) ==> Total 3-stars = [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 6, 7>
<0, 5, 9>
<2, 0, 6, 7>
<4, 1, 7, 9>
<5, 0, 1, 9>
<9, 0, 2, 7>
