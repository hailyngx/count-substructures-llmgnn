Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 7, 6)>, <0, (5, 8, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 5)>, <0, (6, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 9, 7)>, <0, (5, 8, 6)>, <0, (7, 9, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>
