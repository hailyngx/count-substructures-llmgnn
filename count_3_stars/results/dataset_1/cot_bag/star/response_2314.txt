Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7

Now, we'll find the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
