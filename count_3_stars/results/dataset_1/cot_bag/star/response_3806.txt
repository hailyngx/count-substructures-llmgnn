Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 1: 2 neighbors -> no 3-star formed
- Node 4: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 6 neighbors -> \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: 7 neighbors -> \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 35 + 1 = 66

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66]. 

The unique 3-star configurations are: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<4, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 4)>.
