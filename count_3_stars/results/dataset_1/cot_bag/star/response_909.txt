Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's find the 3-stars.

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 14\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14], and they are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>
