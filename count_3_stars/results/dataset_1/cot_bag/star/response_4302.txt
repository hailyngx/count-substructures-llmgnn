Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first note the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with degree 3 or more:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 9, 8)>
