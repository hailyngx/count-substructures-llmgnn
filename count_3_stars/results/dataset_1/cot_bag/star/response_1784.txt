Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes. 

Nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
