Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.  

The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 5), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8) 

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars within the graph.  

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (0, 4), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9)  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (4, 7), (6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 9)  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (4, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 4)  

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find that node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars, and node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars within the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)> 
<7, (4, 9, 8)> 
<7, (6, 4, 9)> 
<7, (6, 9, 8)> 
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
