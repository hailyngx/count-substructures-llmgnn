Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1] = 1
- Node 2: [\[ \binom{3}{3} \] = 1] = 1
- Node 3: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10] = 10
- Node 7: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10] = 10
- Node 9: [\[ \binom{5}{3} \] = 10] = 10

Adding these up gives: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 32

So, there are 32 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 3>
- <2, 7, 6>
- <3, 4, 2>
- <3, 7, 0>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 9, 5>
- <3, 9, 7>
- <7, 0, 9>
- <7, 2, 3>
- <7, 3, 0>
- <7, 3, 9>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <7, 9, 3>
- <9, 0, 3>
- <9, 3, 7>
- <9, 5, 1>
- <9, 7, 0>
- <9, 7, 3>
- <9, 8, 3>
