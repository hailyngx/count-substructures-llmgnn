Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 5, node 6, and node 8.

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 5: 0, 3, 6, and 8. Applying the formula, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5. 
<5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>

For node 6:
There are 2 neighbors connected to node 6: 0 and 5. There's only one 3-star with node 6.
<6, (0, 5, 8)>

For node 8:
There are 3 neighbors connected to node 8: 2, 5, and 9. Applying the formula, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 8. 
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 = 6].
