Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in the graph. Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \( 4 + 35 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 93 \).
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [93].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
