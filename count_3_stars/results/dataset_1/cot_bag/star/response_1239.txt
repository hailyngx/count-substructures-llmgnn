Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the nodes and edges in the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1: (0, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 1), (6, 1), (9, 1) -> Total 1 3-star
Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4) -> Total [inom{4}{3}] 3-stars
Node 7: (2, 7), (4, 7), (6, 7), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8) -> Total [inom{4}{3}] 3-stars
Node 8: (0, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 8) -> Total [inom{5}{3}] 3-stars
Node 9: (1, 9), (4, 9), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8) -> Total 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{4}{3}] + [inom{5}{3}] + 1 = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
