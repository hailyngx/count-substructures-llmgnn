Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 7 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 35 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 55 \)

Therefore, inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 55.
The unique 3-stars found inside <> are: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 3, 8)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (6, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (8, 3, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 2)>
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
