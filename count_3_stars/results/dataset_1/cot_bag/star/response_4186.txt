Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 1
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 4

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <0, (6, 5, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. So, the final answer is [4] with the unique 3-stars being <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (6, 5, 8)>.
