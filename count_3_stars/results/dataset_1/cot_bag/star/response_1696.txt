Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
