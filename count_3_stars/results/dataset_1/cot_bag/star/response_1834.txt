Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to node 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.

Now we'll determine the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 6)>.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 8)>.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
