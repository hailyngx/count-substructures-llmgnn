Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. We will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 3)>

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (0, 7, 8)>

For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars is 17. Therefore, the final answer is [17].
