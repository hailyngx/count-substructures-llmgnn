Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6), (9, 1)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 5, and 9
- Node 2 has neighbors 1 and 4
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 3, and 6
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 5, and 7

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

Number of 3-stars from Node 1 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Number of 3-stars from Node 2 = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
Number of 3-stars from Node 5 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Number of 3-stars from Node 6 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3  [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
