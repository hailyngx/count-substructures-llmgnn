Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
