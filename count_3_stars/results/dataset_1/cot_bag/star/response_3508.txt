Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we first find the nodes with three or more neighbors: 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 20 + 10 = 34 \]

So, there are 34 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
\[ <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)> \]

Putting the final number inside brackets []:
\[ [34] \]
