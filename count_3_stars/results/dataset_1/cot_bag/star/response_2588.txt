Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of this graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)]

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, and 6. So, we have 3 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 4. So, we have 3 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>

Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 6, and 7. So, we have 1 3-star:
<2, (1, 6, 7)>

Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 5, and 9. So, we have 1 3-star:
<3, (0, 5, 9)>

Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 7, and 9. So, we have 1 3-star:
<4, (1, 7, 9)>

Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 4. So, we have 2 3-stars:
<9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
