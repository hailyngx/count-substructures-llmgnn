Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, node 3, node 6, node 7, and node 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around each of them:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<3, (0, 4, 8)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<7, (0, 6, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

Summing up all the 3-stars from each node, we have a total of [17] 3-stars.
