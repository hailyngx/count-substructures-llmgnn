Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
Graph: 
0 — 6 — 1 — 4 — 7
Ʌ   Ʌ \  |  /  Ʌ   |
9 — 5   9 — 3 — 8
```

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 3 3-stars: <3, (5, 8, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, and <3, (5, 9, 0)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (7, 1, 6)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (8, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
