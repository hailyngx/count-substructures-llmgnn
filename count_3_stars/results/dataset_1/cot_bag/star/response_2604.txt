Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 and Node 4 both have 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars form with each of them.
- Node 5, Node 7, and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars form with them.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 4) = 20

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [20]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>.
