Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 26 edges in this graph. 

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 8)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 9)

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 25 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (3, 5, 9)>.
