Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they can potentially form 3-stars. Then we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each such node.

The nodes with three or more neighbors in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For node 1: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
For node 2: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
For node 3: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
For node 6: C(2, 3) = 0 3-stars
For node 9: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
