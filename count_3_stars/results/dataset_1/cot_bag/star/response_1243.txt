Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
Node 1: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
Node 5: \({2 \choose 3} = 0\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(10+1+4+4+1+0 = 20\), which we will put inside brackets as [20].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 2)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
