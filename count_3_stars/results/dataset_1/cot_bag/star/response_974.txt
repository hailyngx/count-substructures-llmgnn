Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 9} (degree 4)
Node 7 has neighbors: {0, 6, 8, 9} (degree 4)
Node 9 has neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 8} (degree 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 9) = 12

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, and <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
