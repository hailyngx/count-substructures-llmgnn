Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. Therefore, the answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
