Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [10] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 4, 7>
- <0, 3, 6, 9>
- <0, 4, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 7, 9>
- <3, 6, 8, 9>
