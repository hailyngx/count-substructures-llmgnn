Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with exactly three neighbors: nodes 0 and 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: Node 0 is neighbors with nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars from node 0:
  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  So, there are 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

- For node 2: Node 2 is neighbors with nodes 1, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars from node 2:
  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  So, there is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 = 5. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
