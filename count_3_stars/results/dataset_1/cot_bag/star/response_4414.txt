Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to node 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

Now, we will check each node to see which ones can form 3-stars:

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For the remaining nodes, they have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 = 24.
