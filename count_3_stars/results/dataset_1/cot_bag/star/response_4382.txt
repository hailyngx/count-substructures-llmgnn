Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3 and Node 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Adding these up: \( 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60 \).

Thus, there are 60 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final answer inside brackets: [60].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>,
<8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>,
<3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 4, 9)>.
