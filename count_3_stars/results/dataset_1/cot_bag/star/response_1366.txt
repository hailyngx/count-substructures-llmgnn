Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 3, 5, and 7. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For node 5:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 7:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 10 = 21.

Therefore, the answer is [21].
The unique 3-stars formed are: 
<3, (2, 5, 8)> 
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 4, 9)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
