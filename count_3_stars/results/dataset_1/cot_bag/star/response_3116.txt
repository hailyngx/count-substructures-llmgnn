Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
