Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 7.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 0 as center: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 1 as center: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, and 7.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 3 as center: <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>

For nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
- These nodes have 3 neighbors each, so each forms only 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 23.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>,
<1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>,
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>,
<4, (0, 5, 6)>,
<5, (0, 6, 7)>,
<6, (0, 2, 7)>,
<7, (2, 6, 8)>,
<8, (5, 6, 8)>,
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
