Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 43 \)

Therefore, there are 43 3-stars in this graph, and the list of unique 3-stars is:
[<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 2, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>]
