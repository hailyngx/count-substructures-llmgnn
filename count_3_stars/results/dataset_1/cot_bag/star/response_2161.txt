Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 7

We can observe that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7 have three or more neighbors, thus they have the potential to form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - {0, (2, 3, 6)}
  - {0, (2, 3, 9)}
  - {0, (2, 6, 9)}
  - {0, (3, 6, 9)}

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - {1, (4, 5, 7)}

- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - {5, (1, 2, 3)}

- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - {7, (4, 1, 9)}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [7] \). The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (4, 1, 9)>
