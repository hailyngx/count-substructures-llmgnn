Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 9. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 0.
Node 1 has 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars formed with node 1.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 9.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 70 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>.
