Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
