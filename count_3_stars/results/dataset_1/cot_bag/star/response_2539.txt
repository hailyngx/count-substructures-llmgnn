Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's write down the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors: Nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)

Adding these up, we get a total of 14 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 3, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 3)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (8, 4, 1)>, <3, (8, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <8, (2, 7, 1)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 1, 7)>, <8, (4, 9, 3)>. 

Note: Some combinations may not form valid 3-stars if they share common nodes with other combinations.
