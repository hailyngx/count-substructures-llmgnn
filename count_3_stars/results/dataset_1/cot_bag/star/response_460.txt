Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 7) = 11

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
