Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 4 = 15. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>
