Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 8)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>

So, the final answer is [13].
