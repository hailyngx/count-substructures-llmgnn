Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

For node 0:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Number of 3-stars for node 0: 1
- Unique 3-star: <0, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Number of 3-stars for node 4: 1
- Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars for node 6: 4
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 4)>

For node 7:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars for node 7: 4
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 6)>

For node 9:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors for node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Number of 3-stars for node 9: 4
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
