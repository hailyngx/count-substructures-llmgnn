Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Next, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 9) = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 6, 5)>
- <3, (5, 0, 9)>
- <3, (5, 9, 1)>
- <9, (1, 7, 3)>
- <9, (3, 0, 7)>
- <9, (3, 0, 4)>
- <9, (3, 0, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 0)>
- <9, (3, 5, 1)>
- <9, (3, 7, 1)>
- <9, (5, 0, 3)>
- <9, (5, 3, 1)>
- <9, (6, 0, 4)>
- <9, (7, 1, 3)>
  
These are the unique 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph.
