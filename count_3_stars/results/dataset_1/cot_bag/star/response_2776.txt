Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8. 
   There are 1 3-star formed with node 0: <0, (3, 7, 8)>.

2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
   Node 1 does not form any 3-star.

3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5.
   There are 1 3-star formed with node 2: <2, (3, 4, 5)>.

4. Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.
   There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.
   <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, 
   <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>.

5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5.
   There are 1 3-star formed with node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>.

6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6.
   There are 1 3-star formed with node 5: <5, (2, 3, 6)>.

7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
   Node 6 does not form any 3-star.

8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8.
   There are 1 3-star formed with node 7: <7, (0, 1, 8)>.

9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 7.
   There are 1 3-star formed with node 8: <8, (0, 1, 7)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 25 3-stars.
