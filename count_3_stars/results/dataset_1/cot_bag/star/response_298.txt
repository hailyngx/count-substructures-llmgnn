Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 9
- 1 is connected to 7
- 2 is connected to 6, 7, 9
- 4 is connected to 7
- 6 is connected to 2
- 7 is connected to 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- 8 is connected to 7
- 9 is connected to 0, 2, 7

Now, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, thus it can form a 3-star. There are C(3, 3) = 1 way.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, thus it can form C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, thus it can form a 3-star. There are C(3, 3) = 1 way.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 1] = 12

Unique 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 9, 8)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 2)>
