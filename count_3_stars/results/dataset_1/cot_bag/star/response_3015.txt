Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Here, node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form 4 3-stars. Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with these nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars that can be formed using node 4:

- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (3, 2, 9)>

Thus, there are 4 3-stars in total. So, the final answer is [4].
