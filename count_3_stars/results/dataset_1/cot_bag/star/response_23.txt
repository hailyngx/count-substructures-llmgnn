Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (2, 5, 8)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<5, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, we have:
\[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [20] \]
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
