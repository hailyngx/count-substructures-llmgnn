Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 59 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 9, 3)>, <0, (9, 3, 4)>, <0, (9, 3, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <0, (9, 7, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 0, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>
