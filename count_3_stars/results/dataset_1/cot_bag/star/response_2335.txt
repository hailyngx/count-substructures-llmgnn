Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the provided information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 1 and 5
- 1 is connected to 0, 2, 6, 8
- 2 is connected to 1, 8
- 3 is connected to 5
- 4 is connected to 7
- 5 is connected to 0, 3, 7, 8
- 6 is connected to 1, 8
- 7 is connected to 4, 5, 8
- 8 is connected to 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (6, 8, 5)>
  - <1, (8, 5, 7)>

- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <5, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (7, 8, 1)>
  - <5, (8, 1, 6)>

- Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
  - <8, (1, 2, 5)>
  - <8, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (1, 7, 4)>
  - <8, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (5, 7, 4)>
  - <8, (6, 7, 4)>
  - <8, (7, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 10] = [18].  
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 5)>, <1, (8, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 1)>, <5, (8, 1, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 4)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 4)>, <8, (6, 7, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 5)>.
