Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the given edges:

0: 1
1: 0, 3, 4
2: 8
3: 1, 7
4: 1, 6
5: 6
6: 4, 5, 9
7: 3, 9
8: 2
9: 6, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Hence, there are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in this graph: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>. 
That gives the final count as [2].
