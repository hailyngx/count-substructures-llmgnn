Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 14

So, the total number of 3-stars is [14].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
