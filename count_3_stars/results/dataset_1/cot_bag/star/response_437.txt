Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 7, 9
Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 2: 5, 6
Node 3: 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 3
Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 9
Node 6: 2, 3, 5
Node 7: 0, 1, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 7

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
