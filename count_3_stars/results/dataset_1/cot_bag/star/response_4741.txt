Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's construct the 3-star graph:

- Node 1 has neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7}. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 7}. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9}. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has neighbors {1, 5, 8}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors {4, 7, 9}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has neighbors {3, 6, 8}. It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 25.

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 4, 5)>
- <1, (6, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (6, 1, 4)>
- <5, (6, 1, 7)>
- <5, (6, 2, 4)>
- <5, (6, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
