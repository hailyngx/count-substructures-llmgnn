Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges described form the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 4), (6, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$
  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (0, 7, 8, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
  
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (2, 5, 7)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $20 + 4 + 1 = 25$.

So, the final answer is [25].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
