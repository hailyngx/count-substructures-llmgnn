Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [26].

And the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
