Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes.

- Node 0: 5 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (4, 6)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 9)
- Node 6: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 9)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 55

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
