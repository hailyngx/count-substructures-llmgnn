Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's go through each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
