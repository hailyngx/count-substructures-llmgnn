Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph using the formula mentioned earlier.

For node 2:
- It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is given by: \[ [4] = 4 \]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
