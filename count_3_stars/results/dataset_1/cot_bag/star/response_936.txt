Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9)
Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 2 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9)
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9)
Node 5 has 6 neighbors: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9)
Node 6 has 1 neighbor
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8)
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7)
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
