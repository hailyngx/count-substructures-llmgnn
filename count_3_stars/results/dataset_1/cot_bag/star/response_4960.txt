Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 1 neighbor (7)
Node 1: 1 neighbor (5)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 9)
Node 3: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8)
Node 4: 1 neighbor (3)
Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9)
Node 6: 1 neighbor (8)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9)
Node 9: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the degrees of the nodes:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [12], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>
