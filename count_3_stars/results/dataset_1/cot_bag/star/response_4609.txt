Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 5, 8). Thus, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: (0, 8). Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5, 6). It can form 1 3-star.
  <3, (0, 5, 6)>

- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: (0, 3). It cannot form any 3-star due to not having enough neighbors.

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (3, 7, 9). It can form 1 3-star.
  <6, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 6, 8, 9). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (0, 2, 7). It can form 1 3-star.
  <8, (0, 2, 7)>

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (4, 6, 7). It can form 1 3-star.
  <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 11.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>.
