Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3 is connected to node 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. We will ignore any node that has less than 3 neighbors.

- For node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- For node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 6, 8>
- <0, 4, 6, 9>
- <0, 1, 4, 6>
- <0, 1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 6, 8>
- <1, 4, 6, 9>
- <2, 4, 6, 5>
- <2, 4, 6, 7>
- <4, 5, 6, 7>
- <6, 0, 1, 8>
- <6, 0, 1, 9>
- <6, 0, 2, 5>
- <6, 0, 2, 7>
- <6, 1, 2, 5>
- <6, 1, 2, 7>
- <9, 0, 1, 5>
