Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will determine which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each such node.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12 \)

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
