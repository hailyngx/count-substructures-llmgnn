Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed around it:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - <1, (2, 5, 8)>
  
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - <2, (1, 9, 7)>
  
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
  
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
  
- Node 5: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
  
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
  
- Node 7: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
  
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - <8, (1, 5, 9)>
  
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - <9, (2, 7, 8)>
   
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 9, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, and <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
