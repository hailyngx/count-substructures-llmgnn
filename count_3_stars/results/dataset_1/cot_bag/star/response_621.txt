Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges in this graph are: {(0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 9), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)}

Based on the given graph, we can find the 3-stars and count them.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, and 9, so [\(\color{red}{\binom{3}{3}}\)] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, and 7, so [\(\color{red}{\binom{4}{3}}\)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 5, so [\(\color{red}{\binom{3}{3}}\)] = 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 9, so [\(\color{red}{\binom{3}{3}}\)] = 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, and 9, so [\(\color{red}{\binom{4}{3}}\)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, and 7, so [\(\color{red}{\binom{4}{3}}\)] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15
