Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<6, (9, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
