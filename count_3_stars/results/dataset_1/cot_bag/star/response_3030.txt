Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
0: 3, 4, 6, 8
1: 2, 3, 7, 9
2: 1, 4
3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
4: 0, 2, 3, 9
5: 3, 8
6: 0, 7
7: 1, 6, 8
8: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
9: 1, 4, 8

Node 0 forms a 3-star with 3, 4, and 8.
Node 1 forms a 3-star with 2, 7, and 9.
Node 3 forms a 3-star with 1, 4, and 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
