Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 1: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 2: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 3: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 4: C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- For node 5: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 6: No 3-stars
- For node 7: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 8: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- For node 9: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

So, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 9, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>
