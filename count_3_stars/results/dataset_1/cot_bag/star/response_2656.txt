Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 44 edges, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 8, 9).
- Total 3-stars with Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for Node 0: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8).
- Total 3-stars with Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars for Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 7, 8).
- Total 3-stars with Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>

For Nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9:
- These nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with them.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
