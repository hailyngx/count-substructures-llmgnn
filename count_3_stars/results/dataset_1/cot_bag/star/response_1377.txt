Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38 \).

So there are 38 3-stars. Listing out the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 5)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 0, 7)>, <6, (2, 0, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 0, 9)>, <6, (8, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
