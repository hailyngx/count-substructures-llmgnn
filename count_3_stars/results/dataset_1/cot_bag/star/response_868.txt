Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the edges are given as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8.

Now, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star with any of its neighbors:

1. Node 0 has two neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has two neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
3. Node 2 has two neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 has two neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has four neighbors: (0, 6, 7, 8). It forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 5 has three neighbors: (1, 3, 8). It forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 6 has four neighbors: (1, 2, 4, 7). It forms 1 3-star.
8. Node 7 has three neighbors: (4, 6, 9). It forms 1 3-star.
9. Node 8 has four neighbors: (2, 4, 5, 9). It forms 1 3-star.
10. Node 9 has four neighbors: (0, 3, 7, 8). It forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
