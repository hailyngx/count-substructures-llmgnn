Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, and <8, (3, 4, 5)>.
