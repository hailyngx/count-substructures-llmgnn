Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 4
 /  \   | \
9 -- 1--8 3
|    /|   
|   / |   
2 -  7--5
       |
       6
```

Let's go through each node to count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <1, (8, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <4, (0, 8, 3)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 0, 8)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <9, (1, 0, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 0)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4] = 9. The unique 3-stars are <1, (8, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 3)>, <4, (8, 0, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 0, 8)>, <9, (1, 0, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 0)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>.
