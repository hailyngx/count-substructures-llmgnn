Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
With 10 nodes, there are potential 3-stars involving nodes with at least 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 possible 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 4)>, <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <2, (6, 4, 0)>
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 possible 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 2, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 2, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 2)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 possible 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 4)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 possible 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 4)>, <6, (4, 2, 5)>, <6, (5, 2, 4)>
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 possible 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 4)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 1)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 8)>, <7, (8, 1, 4)>, <7, (8, 4, 1)>, <7, (8, 4, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 4)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Summing up the total number of possible 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [34].
