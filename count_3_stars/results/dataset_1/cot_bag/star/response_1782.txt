Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9 and the edges are given. Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 6, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, and 6, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, and 9, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.  
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 8, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9, forming 3 3-stars.  
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.  
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, and 7, forming 1 3-star.

In total, we have formed 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 8 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, and <9, (2, 6, 7)>.
