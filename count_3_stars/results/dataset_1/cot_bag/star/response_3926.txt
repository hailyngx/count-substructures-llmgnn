Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

0: 2, 5  
1: 2, 8  
2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9  
3: 4, 5, 8, 9  
4: 3, 7  
5: 0, 2, 3  
6: 2, 7, 8  
7: 2, 4, 6, 9  
8: 1, 3, 6  
9: 2, 3, 7  

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

From node 2:  
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed  

From node 3:  
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed  

From node 7:  
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed  

From node 9:  
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars formed  

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [19] \).

The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (0, 1, 6)>  
<2, (0, 1, 7)>  
<2, (0, 1, 9)>  
<2, (0, 5, 6)>  
<2, (0, 5, 7)>  
<2, (0, 5, 9)>  
<2, (0, 6, 7)>  
<2, (0, 6, 9)>  
<2, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<2, (1, 5, 7)>  
<2, (1, 5, 9)>  
<2, (1, 6, 7)>  
<2, (1, 6, 9)>  
<2, (1, 7, 9)>  
<2, (5, 6, 7)>  
<2, (5, 6, 9)>  
<2, (5, 7, 9)>  
<3, (4, 5, 8)>  
<3, (4, 5, 9)>  
<3, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (5, 8, 9)>  
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
