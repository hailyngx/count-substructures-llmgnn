Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 4
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 7
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 5
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 1
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 6
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 7
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 9
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 7

Only node 7 has three or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Hence, there is only one 3-star centered at node 7. 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [1]

Therefore, the unique 3-star found in this graph is: <7, (1, 6, 9)>
