Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, let's first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>.
