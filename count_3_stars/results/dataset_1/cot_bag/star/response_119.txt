Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 5, 6 and 9. So, [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, 6 and 9. So, [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2 and 3. So, [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 3 and 4. So, [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5 and 7. So, [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 5 and 6. So, [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 18.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are: <<0, 3, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 6, 9>, <1, 3, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 6, 9>, <1, 4, 6, 9>, <4, 1, 2, 3>, <6, 0, 1, 3>, <6, 0, 1, 4>, <6, 0, 3, 4>, <6, 1, 3, 4>, <8, 2, 5, 7>, <9, 0, 1, 5>, <9, 0, 1, 6>, <9, 0, 5, 6>, <9, 1, 5, 6>>.
