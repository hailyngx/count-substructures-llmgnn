Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 6
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 3

We can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <0, (1, 5, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 5)>, 
  <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 2)>, <2, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (3, 9, 2)>, <2, (4, 9, 2)>, <2, (9, 6, 2)>, <2, (6, 5, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 2)>, <2, (6, 7, 2)>, <2, (7, 9, 2)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 9, 8)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <5, (0, 2, 6)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <6, (2, 5, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <8, (0, 1, 4)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars: 1 (from Node 0) + 20 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 9) = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
