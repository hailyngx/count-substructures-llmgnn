Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Node 1, Node 5, and Node 9 fit this criteria.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- We can form 1 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 5, 6)>.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- We can form 1 3-star with Node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 4, 9)>.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- We can form 1 3-star with Node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, and <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
