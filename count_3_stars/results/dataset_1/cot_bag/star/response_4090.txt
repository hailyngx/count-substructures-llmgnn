Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the breakdown of the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
  The 3-stars are: 
  <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>.

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. 
  The 3-star is:
  <3, (2, 7, 9)>.

- Node 6 also has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
  The 3-stars are: 
  <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>.

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 9), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
  The 3-stars are: 
  <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>.

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2, 6), so no 3-star is formed with this node.

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7), so it can form 1 3-star. 
  The 3-star is:
  <9, (0, 3, 7)>.

Putting all the unique 3-stars found together we get: 
[<2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>].
