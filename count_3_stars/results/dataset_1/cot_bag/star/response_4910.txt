Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's analyze each node to see if it forms part of a 3-star.

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 1: Degree 2
Node 2: Degree 3
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 1
Node 5: Degree 5
Node 6: Degree 3
Node 7: Degree 1
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
Node 0: $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
Node 2: $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
Node 5: $\binom{5}{3}$ = 10
Node 6: $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
Node 9: $\binom{5}{3}$ = 10

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10] = 23

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
