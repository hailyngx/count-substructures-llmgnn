Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3 forms \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(20 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 51\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (3, 2, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].
