Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 5>
- <2, 0, 5>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 0>
- <3, 5, 2>
- <3, 5, 4>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 7, 1>
- <3, 8, 4>
- <4, 3, 8>
- <5, 0, 2>
- <5, 2, 0>
- <5, 3, 4>
