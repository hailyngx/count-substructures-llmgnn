Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
