Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
     1 --- 2
    /      |
   0       3
   |       |
   4 --- 5

   6
   |
   7
   |
   8

   9
```

From the provided information, we see that node 0 has 6 neighbors, node 2 has 4 neighbors, node 3 has 5 neighbors, and the rest of the nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so we won't consider them further for 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes 0, 2, and 3:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, and <3, (4, 5, 8)>.
