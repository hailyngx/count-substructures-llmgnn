Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

The edges are: 
(1, 3), (1, 6), 
(2, 6), (2, 8), 
(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), 
(4, 3), (4, 6), 
(5, 7), 
(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), 
(7, 3), (7, 5), 
(8, 2), 
(9, 3)

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph: 

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 6)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (6, 8)>
Node 3 forms four 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 7)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 11)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
