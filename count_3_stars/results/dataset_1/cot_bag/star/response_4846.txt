Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
   <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
   <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
   <8, (4, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 4] = 22
The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, and <8, (4, 7, 9)>.
