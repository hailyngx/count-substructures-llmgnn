Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph in a more visual way:

```
    0 --- 4 --- 7
    |     |   / |
    |     |  /  |
    |     | /   |
    7 --- 6 --- 3
         |     |
         |     |
         8 --- 1
         |
         5 --- 9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbor
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Only nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 4:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
