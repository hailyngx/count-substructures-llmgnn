Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph to visualize it and identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 8, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 2, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 4 (2 neighbors)

Based on the number of neighbors, we see that the following nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 (5 neighbors)
- Node 1 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8 (4 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
