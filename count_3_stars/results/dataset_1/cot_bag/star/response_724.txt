Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.  
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.  
Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.  
Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.  
Node 7 is connected to node 2.  
Node 8 is connected to node 1.  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

From the list of edges, node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
From the list of edges, node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
From the list of edges, node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
From the list of edges, node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [16]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 9, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 2, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (6, 4, 5)>, <9, (6, 5, 4)> 

So, the final answer is: [16]
