Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as pairs of nodes that are connected by an edge. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
   So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
   The 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>.

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
   It can form 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 6)>.

3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
   It can form 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>.

4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
   It can form 1 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 7)>.

5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
   It cannot form any 3-star.

6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
   So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
   The 3-stars are: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>.

7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
   So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
   The 3-stars are: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>.

8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
   It can form 1 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 8)>.

9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
   It can form 1 3-star: <8, (0, 7, 8)>.

10. Node 9 has 1 neighbor.
    It cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of [16].
