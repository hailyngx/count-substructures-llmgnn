Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list those nodes and the number of neighbors they have:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars from the nodes together, we get a total of 48 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
- <1, 2, 3, 6>
- <2, 4, 0, 5>
- <2, 4, 6, 9>
- <2, 4, 7, 9>
- <2, 4, 8, 9>
- <2, 5, 7, 9>
- <2, 5, 8, 9>
- <4, 8, 2, 5>
- <4, 9, 6, 2>
- <6, 1, 3, 2>
- <7, 9, 2, 5>
- <8, 9, 2, 4>
