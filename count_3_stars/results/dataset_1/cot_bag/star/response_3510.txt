Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their connected neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 32

So, the final answer is [32]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (9, 8, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
