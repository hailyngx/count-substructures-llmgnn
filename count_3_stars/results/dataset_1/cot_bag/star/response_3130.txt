Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph: 
<Graph image>

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with the number of neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>
<9, (7, 4, 0)>
<9, (7, 0, 4)>
