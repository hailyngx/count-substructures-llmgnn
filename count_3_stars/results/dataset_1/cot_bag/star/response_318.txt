Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 8, 5, and 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0:
\({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars

Node 1:
\({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars

Node 3:
\({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars

Node 8:
\({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars

Node 5:
Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors: <5, (0, 1, 4)>

Node 4:
\({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star

Adding up, we have a total of \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42\) 3-stars. So, \([42]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>.
