Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Adding these up gives us a total of 14 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [14].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
