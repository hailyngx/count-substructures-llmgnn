Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {2}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8}

Considering only the nodes with three or more neighbors, we observe that nodes 2, 5, and 9 have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1] = 9 \).

Unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 9)>
