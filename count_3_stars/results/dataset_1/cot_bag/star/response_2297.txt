Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
There are 4 edges connected to node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9).
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we get \( \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4 \).
So, there are 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>.

For node 2:
There are 6 edges connected to node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9).
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we get \( \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 \).
So, there are 20 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 4:
There are 5 edges connected to node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9).
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we get \( \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10 \).
So, there are 10 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

For node 6:
There are 4 edges connected to node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9).
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we get \( \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4 \).
So, there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 3)>.

For node 9:
There are 6 edges connected to node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 6).
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we get \( \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!} = 20 \).
So, there are 20 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 58.
Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in this graph.
