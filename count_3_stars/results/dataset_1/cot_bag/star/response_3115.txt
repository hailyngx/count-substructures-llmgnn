Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 9, and 4.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three neighbors:
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The unique 3-stars involving node 3 are <3, (4, 8, 9)> and <3, (4, 8, 4)>.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - The unique 3-stars involving node 7 are <7, (1, 2, 8)> and <7, (1, 8, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 = 8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 8)>.
