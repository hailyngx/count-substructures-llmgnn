Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given above. Let's go ahead and find the total number of 3-stars in this graph following the method described earlier:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars from node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (3, 7, 9)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9
Number of 3-stars from node 2 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6
Number of 3-stars from node 3 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 8
Number of 3-stars from node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 8)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 9
Number of 3-stars from node 5 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<5, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8
Number of 3-stars from node 6 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<6, (1, 3, 8)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars from node 8 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 25. 
Therefore, the final answer is [25].
