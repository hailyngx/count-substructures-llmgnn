Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
To solve this, we first need to identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>
