Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The node connections can be illustrated as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7.

The possible 3-stars and their count are:
- For Node 0: [<0, (3, 5, 8)>]
- For Node 3: [<3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>]
- For Node 6: [<6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>]
- For Node 7: [<7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>]

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars present in the graph is [7].
