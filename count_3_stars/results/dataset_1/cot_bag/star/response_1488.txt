Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
From the given information, we construct the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges.

The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 \).

Therefore, the answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
