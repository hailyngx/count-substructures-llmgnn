Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 8, 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 6
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 3, 6
Node 8: 1, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 8

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<9, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<9, (3, 8, 9)>.
