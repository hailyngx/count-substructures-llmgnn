Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will follow the steps outlined earlier.

Let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [C(3,3)] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors -> [C(3,3)] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: 4 neighbors -> [C(4,3)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 4: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 6: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 7: 2 neighbors -> No 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 neighbor -> No 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 neighbor -> No 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) = 6.

Therefore, the final answer is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 3)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>.
