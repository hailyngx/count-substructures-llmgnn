Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{10}{3} = 120 \) ways to choose 3 nodes out of 10. Let's now determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $[4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 10$.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 0, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
