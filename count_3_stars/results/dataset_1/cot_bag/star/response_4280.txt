Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 6)>
