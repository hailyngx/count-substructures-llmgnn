Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 1, 6, 9
- 1 is connected to 0, 5, 6, 8
- 2 is connected to 7
- 3 is connected to 6, 7
- 4 is connected to 5
- 5 is connected to 1, 4
- 6 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 8
- 7 is connected to 2, 3, 9
- 8 is connected to 1, 6
- 9 is connected to 0, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- 0 has 3 neighbors
- 1 has 4 neighbors
- 6 has 4 neighbors
- 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Number of 3-stars from node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Number of 3-stars from node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Number of 3-stars from node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Number of 3-stars from node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these together: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
