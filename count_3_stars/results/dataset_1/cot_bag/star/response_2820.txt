Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's analyze each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <3, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 7, 6)>
  - <3, (4, 7, 6)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (4, 7, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <7, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <7, (2, 3, 5)>
  - <7, (0, 1, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <9, (1, 2, 8)>

By summing up the 3-stars, we get a total of [15].
