Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node that has three or more neighbors. 
Here are the nodes with their neighbors: 

Node 0: 2, 4
Node 1: 5, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 3: 2, 8
Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 4, 5
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (formed with nodes 2, 4, 5)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (formed with nodes 0, 3, 9)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (formed with nodes 0, 5, 9)
- Node 5: 1 3-star (formed with nodes 1, 4, 6)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (formed with nodes 1, 3, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
