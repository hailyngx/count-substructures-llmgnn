Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: [1].
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: [1].
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: [4].
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: [4].
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: [4].
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: [4].

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 9, 0)>
<2, (0, 7, 5)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
