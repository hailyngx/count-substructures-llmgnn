Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 5, 6
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 1, 5
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 4, 5

Now let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 3: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star with <3, (5, 6)>
Node 5: 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars with <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>

Put the total number of 3-stars inside brackets []:
[5]

List of unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 6)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
