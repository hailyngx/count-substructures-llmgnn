Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 9.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 5.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 5)>
