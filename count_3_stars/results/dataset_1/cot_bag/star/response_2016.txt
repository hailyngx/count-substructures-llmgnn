Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes connected to at least three other nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 11 3-stars. So, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>.
