Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 9
2. Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7
4. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
5. Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 20] = 46.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 9, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>
