Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8.

For node 0:
- It has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
- Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 5)>

For node 2:
- It has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
- Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 7)>

For node 4:
- It has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 5:
- It has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>

For node 8:
- It has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
