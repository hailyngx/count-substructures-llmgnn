Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 5, 8)>.
