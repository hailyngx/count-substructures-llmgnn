Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 9)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 6)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8)
- Node 6: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47]. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
