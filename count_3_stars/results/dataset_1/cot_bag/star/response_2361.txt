Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 5).
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, and 5).
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8).
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, and 8).
5. Node 4 has 1 neighbor (node 9).
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9).
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 8, and 9).
8. Node 7 has 2 neighbors (nodes 8 and 9).
9. Node 8 has 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9).
10. Node 9 has 5 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29

Therefore, there are 29 3-stars in this graph. 

Inside brackets [], we put 29: [29]
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 2)>,  <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>,  <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>
