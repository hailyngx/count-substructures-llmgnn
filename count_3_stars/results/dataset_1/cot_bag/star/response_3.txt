Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, and 7. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 7. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, and 9. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, 
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (5, 6, 9)>.
