Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list down the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 (neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 6)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: \( 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 60 \)

So, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>
