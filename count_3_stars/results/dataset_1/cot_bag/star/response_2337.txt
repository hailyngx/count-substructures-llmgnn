Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Note: Node 1 does not have 3 or more neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6, so the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 4)>
- <3, (1, 7, 5)>
- <3, (5, 7, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
