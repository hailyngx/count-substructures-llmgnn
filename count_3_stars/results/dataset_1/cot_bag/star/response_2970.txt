Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 2
    |         |
    5 -- 4    |
    |      \   |
    9       3--6--8
                |
                7
```

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. We will iterate through each node to see if it forms any 3-stars with its neighbors:

1. Node 0 has neighbors 1 and 2, so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has only 1 neighbor.
3. Node 2 has only 1 neighbor.
4. Node 3 has neighbors 6 and 7, so it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 4 has only 1 neighbor.
6. Node 5 has neighbors 4 and 9, so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 6 has neighbors 3 and 8, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 7 has only 1 neighbor.
9. Node 8 has only 1 neighbor.
10. Node 9 has only 1 neighbor.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2)>
<3, (6, 7)>
<5, (4, 9)>
