Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9).
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 9).
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8).
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 1

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 9).
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4).
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: 1

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5).
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node: 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40]. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>
