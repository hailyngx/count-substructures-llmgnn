Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
Looking at the list of edges, we can see that nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 1, there are edges to nodes 2, 4, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 4, 7)>.

2. For node 3, there are edges to nodes 6, 7, and 9. So, there is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (6, 7, 9)>.

3. For node 4, there are edges to nodes 1, 6, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 6, 7)>.

4. For node 6, there are edges to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7. So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>.

5. For node 7, there are edges to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, there are inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars with node 7 as the center: 
<7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>.

6. For node 9, there are edges to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8. So, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4] = [31] 3-stars.
