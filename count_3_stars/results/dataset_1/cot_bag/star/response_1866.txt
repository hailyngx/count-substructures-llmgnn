Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors first. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {0, 6, 7, 8}
   - Number of 3-stars around node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars around node 1: <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 6)>

2. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 9}
   - Number of 3-stars around node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-stars around node 3: <3, (0, 4, 9)>

3. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: {3, 8}
   - Node 4 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

4. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {1, 9}
   - Node 6 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

5. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {1, 5}
   - Node 7 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

6. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {1, 4, 9}
   - Number of 3-stars around node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-stars around node 8: <8, (1, 4, 9)>

7. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 6, 8}
   - Number of 3-stars around node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars around node 9: <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>.
