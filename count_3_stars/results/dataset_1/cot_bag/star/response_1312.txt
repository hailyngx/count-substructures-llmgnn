Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9)
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5)
(2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 9)
(3, 1)
(4, 0), (4, 7), (4, 9)
(5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 9)
(7, 4), (7, 9)
(8, 5), (8, 9)
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 1 and 6: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 0 and 9: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 1 and 9: <5, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 0 and 9: <6, (0, 2, 9)>
Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
