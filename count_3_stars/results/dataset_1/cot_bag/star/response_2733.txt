Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors 2 and 8 (2 edges), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has neighbor 3 (1 edge), not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 2 has neighbors 0 and 4 (2 edges), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 7, and 9 (3 edges), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 7, and 8 (3 edges), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has neighbor 6 (1 edge), not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbor 5 (1 edge), not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors 3, 4, and 9 (3 edges), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 4 (2 edges), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has neighbors 3, 7 (2 edges), forming 1 3-star.

By applying the formula, there are a total of $ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 6 + 10 = 16 $ 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, and <4, (2, 7, 8)>.
