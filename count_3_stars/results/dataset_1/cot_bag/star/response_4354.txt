Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have degree 3 or more as these could potentially form the center of a 3-star. From the list of edges you provided, the degree of each node is as follows:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1

Only Node 3 in this graph has degree 3, which means it can form a 3-star. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center node:

For Node 3, the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <3, (0, 4, 5)>.
