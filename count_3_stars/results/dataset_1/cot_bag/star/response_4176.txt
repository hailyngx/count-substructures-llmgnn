Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:
```
         1 -- 2 -- 3
        /|    |  
      5 |    6
        \|  /
         7 -- 8 
              |
              9
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7), so there are 1 3-star possible.
- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6), so there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars possible.
- Node 3: It has 2 neighbors (2, 5), which is less than 3, so no 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 1 neighbor (6), which is less than 3, so no 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 7), so there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars possible.
- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (2, 4), which is less than 3, so no 3-stars.
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 9), so there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars possible.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7), so there are 1 3-star possible.
- Node 9: It has 1 neighbor (7), which is less than 3, so no 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 14.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
