Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: { 1, 8 }
- Node 1: { 0, 4, 6 }
- Node 2: { 4, 5, 8 }
- Node 3: { 8 }
- Node 4: { 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 }
- Node 5: { 2, 4, 6 }
- Node 6: { 1, 4, 5, 8 }
- Node 7: { 9 }
- Node 8: { 0, 2, 3, 6 }
- Node 9: { 4, 7 }

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars. These are: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 2, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars. These are: <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Let's list them:
   - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <4, (1, 5, 9)>
   - <4, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <4, (2, 5, 9)>
   - <4, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Adding these up, we have a total of 3 + 3 + 10 = 16 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [16].
