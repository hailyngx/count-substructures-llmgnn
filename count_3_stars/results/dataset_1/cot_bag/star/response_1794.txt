Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Next, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 29 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
