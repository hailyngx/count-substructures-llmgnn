Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's examine each node to determine how many 3-stars can be formed and then find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 7, 8, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: (5, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as center: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (4, 5, 7, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 6)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 1] = [15]
