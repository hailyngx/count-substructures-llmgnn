Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with the number of their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(6, 3) = 20
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4] = [42]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 1, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
