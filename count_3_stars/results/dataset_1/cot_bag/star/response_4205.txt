Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors - (0, 7) and (9, 6).
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 0 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors - (3, 9) and (9, 7).
Node 7 has 2 neighbors - (0, 7) and (9, 7).
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors - (3, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (9, 3), and (9, 6).

Node 9 has more than 3 neighbors and can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars: 10.

Hence, the answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
