Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12

Thus, there are 12 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number in brackets we get [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

So, the final answer is [12]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, and <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
