Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To start, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33]. The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>
