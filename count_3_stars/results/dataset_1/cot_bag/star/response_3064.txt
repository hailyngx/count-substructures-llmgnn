Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

For node 0: 
There are 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5
From node 0, we can form 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>

For node 3: 
There are 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
From node 3, we can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 4: 
There are 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
From node 4, we can form 1 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 5: 
There are 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
From node 5, we can form 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 6)>

For node 6: 
There are 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5
From node 6, we can form 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 5)>

For node 7: 
There are 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
From node 7, we can form 1 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 4)>

Thus, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars. This number should be inside brackets []. 
So, the total number of 3-stars = [6].
