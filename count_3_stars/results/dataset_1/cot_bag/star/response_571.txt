Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {4, 5}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 6}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, *)> (where * denotes the missing node)
