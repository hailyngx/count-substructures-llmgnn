Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph by checking each node:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3 so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- Nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors so they don't form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [4 + 20] = 24 \).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
