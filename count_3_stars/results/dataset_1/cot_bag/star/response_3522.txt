Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<0, (4, 9, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 5)>
<4, (2, 6, 5)>
<4, (9, 6, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 6, 9)>
