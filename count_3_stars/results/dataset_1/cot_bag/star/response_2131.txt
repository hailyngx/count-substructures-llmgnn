Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, there are a total of 17 3-stars in the given graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 9, 6)>, <5, (3, 9, 6)>, <5, (1, 9, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
