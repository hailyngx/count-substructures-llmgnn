Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
