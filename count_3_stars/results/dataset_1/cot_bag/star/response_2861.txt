Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0 and node 4.
For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 = 14
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
