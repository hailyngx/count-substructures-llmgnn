Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars associated with them. Let's go through the nodes:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors. So, there is 1 3-star.
Node 4 and Node 5 both have 6 neighbors each. Thus, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars for each of them.

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 1 + 20 + 20 = 41 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
