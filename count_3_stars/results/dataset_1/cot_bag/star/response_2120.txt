Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.

For node 0:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 9, *)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars: <3, (1, 9, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [7] \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
