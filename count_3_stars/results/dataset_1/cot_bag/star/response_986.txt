Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

We'll now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 7.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <2, (3, 8, 9)>
2. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
6. <8, (2, 3, 9)>
7. <9, (3, 8, 2)>
