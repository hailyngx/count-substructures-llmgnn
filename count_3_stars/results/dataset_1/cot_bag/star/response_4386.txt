Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

The graph has 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
The edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 47.

So, the final answer is [47].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
