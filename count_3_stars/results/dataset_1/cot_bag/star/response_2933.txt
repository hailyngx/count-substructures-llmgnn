Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 8, 9
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 8
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 3

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>.
