Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars for each node.
- For nodes 0 and 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 5 \times 20 + 2 \times 4 = 100 + 8 = 108 \]

So, there are 108 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found: 

<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [108].
