Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
Node 0: 2, 6, 9
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 0, 7, 9
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 5, 6
Node 5: 4, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 4, 7
Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 9
Node 8: 5
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>

<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
