Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:  
0: 4  
1: 5, 8  
2: 4, 6  
3: 5, 6  
4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9  
5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8  
6: 2, 3, 5, 8  
7: 4  
8: 1, 5, 6, 9  
9: 4, 8  

Now we will determine the 3-stars in the graph:  

For node 4:  
- inom{5}{3} = 10  
<4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 5, 9)>  

For node 5:  
- inom{5}{3} = 10  
<5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (6, 4, 8)>  

For node 8:  
- inom{4}{3} = 4  
<8, (1, 9, 5)>, <8, (1, 9, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (9, 5, 6)>  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 4] = [24].
