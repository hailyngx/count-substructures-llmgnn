Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 1: 6 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 4)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 2)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (7, 8)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7, 8)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 also forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 20 = 60.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 8, 9)>.
