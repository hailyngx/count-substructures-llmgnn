Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges:

```
     0
    /|\
   5 6 7
   | | |
   4 | 1
    \| |
      2
     /|\
    9 3 8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 35 + 10 + 35 + 10 = 91 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [91].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
