Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {1, 3, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For node 0, there is 1 3-star.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5, there is 1 3-star.
- For node 6, there is 1 3-star.

Adding these up:  
Total number of 3-stars = \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7] \)

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>
