Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 3
Node 1: 0, 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 8
Node 3: 0, 7
Node 4: 6, 7
Node 5: 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 4, 8
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 2, 6, 7
Node 9: 5

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 3: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 4: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 5: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars (1 3-star from each combination of 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: Does not have 3 neighbors
- Node 9: Does not have 3 neighbors

In total, there are [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 3-stars in the graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 7)>
<7, (4, 8, 6)> 

So, the final answer is [6].
