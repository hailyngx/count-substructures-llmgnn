Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 4 neighbors: 3, 5, and 7.  
Using \( \binom{4}{3} \) for each of these nodes, we find that there are 4 3-stars formed from node 3, 4 3-stars formed from node 5, and 4 3-stars formed from node 7.  
This results in a total of [12] 3-stars.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<3, (0, 7, 9)>  
<3, (6, 7, 9)>  
<5, (2, 4, 8)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  
<7, (0, 3, 4)>  
<7, (0, 4, 5)>  
<7, (3, 4, 5)>  
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
