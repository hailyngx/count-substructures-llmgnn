Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: 3, 6

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 1: forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 2: forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 3: forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-star
- Node 5: forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 6: forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-star
- Node 7: forms [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-star
- Node 8: forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <8, (0, 1, 5)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 18.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
