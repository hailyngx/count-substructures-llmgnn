Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9.

For node 0: There are 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
For node 2: There are 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 3: There are 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 7: There are 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: There are 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 9: There are 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up, we get a total of 1 (from node 0) + 20 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 55 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
