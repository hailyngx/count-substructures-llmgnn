Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 14 nodes with three or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
  - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, and 9.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
For node 4:
  - Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 9, and 5.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 5:
  - Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, and 8.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7:
  - Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, and 9.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9:
  - Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, and 7.
  - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \).

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 1)>, <9, (0, 7, 1)>. 

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
