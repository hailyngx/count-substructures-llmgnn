Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes with their respective neighbors:

0: 5, 9
1: 5, 9
2: 6
3: 7
4: 9
5: 0, 1, 6
6: 2, 5
7: 3
8: 9
9: 0, 1, 4, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
