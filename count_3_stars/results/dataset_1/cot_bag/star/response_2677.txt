Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we'll construct the graph based on the provided information. 

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are as described. 

Now, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 22 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 7)>
- <8, (0, 3, 2)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 6, 4)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (5, 4, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 6, 4)>
- <8, (2, 0, 5)>
