Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-star graphs in this network:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 4. Applying \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) gives 4 3-stars:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9, 1. Applying \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) gives 10 3-stars:
<5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 9, 4)>, <5, (2, 9, 4)>, <5, (3, 9, 4)>.

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7. Applying \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) gives 10 3-stars:
<6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>.

Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 8 has no neighbors.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of [4 + 10 + 10] = 24 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 9, 4)>, <5, (2, 9, 4)>, <5, (3, 9, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>.
