Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The number of neighbors for each node is:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Number of 3-stars attached to each node:
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
