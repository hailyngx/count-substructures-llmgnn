Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.

We observe that nodes 2 and 7 have 7 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

However, since node 7 is part of the 3-star centered at node 2, we need to subtract the duplicate 3-stars formed:
1. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
4. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
5. <2, (4, 7, 9)>

Adding all the unique 3-stars, we get:
\[ [35 + 10 - 5] = [40] \] 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>
