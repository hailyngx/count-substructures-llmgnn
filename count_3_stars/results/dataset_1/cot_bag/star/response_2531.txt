Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 1), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding them up: [1]

Therefore, there is 1 unique 3-star: <<1, (2, 5, 9)>>.
