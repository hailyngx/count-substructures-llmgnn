Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The number of neighbors for each node is:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
For nodes 0, 7, and 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \]

So, there are 12 3-stars with nodes 0, 7, or 9 as the center.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [12]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 4)>
<7, (8, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
