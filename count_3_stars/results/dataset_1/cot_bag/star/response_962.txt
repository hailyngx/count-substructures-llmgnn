Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will examine the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. We will also check if any of these nodes are connected to each other to form a 3-star.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: Total 3-Stars = ${10 \choose 3} = 120$
  - Only the 3-star <0, (1, 5, 6)> is formed.

- Node 1: Total 3-Stars = ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
  - Only the 3-star <1, (0, 8, 9)> is formed.

- Node 9: Total 3-Stars = ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
  - 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is $[1 + 1 + 4] = 6$.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>
