Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 3, 4, 6.

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (3, 6), so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (4, 5), so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, there are a total of 4 3-stars in this graph. 

Thus, the answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars are: <3, (2, 4, 8)>.
