Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6

Now we calculate the 3-stars for these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>

- For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 20 = 50 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
