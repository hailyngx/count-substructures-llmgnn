Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges based on the provided information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 9), (3, 5), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: Node 0 has neighbors 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
Possible 3-stars involving node 0: [1]

For node 2: Node 2 has neighbors 0 and 9.
Possible 3-stars involving node 2: [0]

For node 3: Node 3 has neighbors 0, 1, 5, and 9.
Possible 3-stars involving node 3: [2], <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>

For remaining nodes with 2 or fewer neighbors: Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 have 1 or 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed involving these nodes.

Summing up all possible 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] total 3-stars in the graph.
