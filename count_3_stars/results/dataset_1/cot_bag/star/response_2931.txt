Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 8  
Node 1: 5, 9  
Node 2: 7, 8  
Node 3: 6, 7  
Node 4: 6, 8  
Node 5: 1, 6  
Node 6: 3, 4, 5  
Node 7: 2, 3  
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 9  
Node 9: 1, 8  

Now, we will identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>
