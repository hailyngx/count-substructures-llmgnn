Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the above nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, we found a total of 1 + 10 + 1 = 12 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>
