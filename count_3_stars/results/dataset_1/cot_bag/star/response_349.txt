Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To begin, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
