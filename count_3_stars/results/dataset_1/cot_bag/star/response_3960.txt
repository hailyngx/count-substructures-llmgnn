Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, we'll check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), and (0, 4, 5). [3]
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (2, 3, 4) and (2, 4, 8). [2]
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (3, 7, 9). [1]
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with (4, 7, 9). [1]

Combining all the 3-stars found, we have:
\[ [3 + 2 + 1 + 1] = [7] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 9)>
