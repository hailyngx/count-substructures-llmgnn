Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 1: 3-stars formed are <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, and <1, (4, 5, 6)>.
- For node 4: 3-stars formed are <4, (0, 1, 5)> and <4, (1, 5, 6)>.
- For node 5: 3-stars formed is <5, (1, 4, 6)>.
- For node 6: 3-stars formed is <6, (0, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, and <6, (0, 5, 7)>.
