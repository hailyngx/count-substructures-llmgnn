Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Let's list the nodes with three or more neighbors along with their neighbors:
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [19] \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
