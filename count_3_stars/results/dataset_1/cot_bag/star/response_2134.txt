Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We observe that nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, providing $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, providing $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, providing $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, providing $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, providing $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 61

Therefore, the final answer is [61].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
