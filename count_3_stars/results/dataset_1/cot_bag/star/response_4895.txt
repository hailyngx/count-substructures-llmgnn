Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 8}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't participate in forming any 3-stars.
- Node 4, Node 6, and Node 8 have 2 neighbors. They also don't participate in forming any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't participate in forming any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't participate in forming any 3-stars.
- Node 5 and Node 9 have 1 neighbor each, so they also don't participate in forming any 3-stars.
- Node 2 is the only node with 1 neighbor, but it can form a single 3-star.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is: <2, 1>
