Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
With the given information, we can draw the following graph:

                           0 -- 2 -- 1
                            \   |   /
                              8 | 5
                                \|/
                                 9
                                 |
                                 3 -- 4 -- 6
                              
We can see that only nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 1 = 12. So, we write this as [12].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, (2, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<2, (6, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 0, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
