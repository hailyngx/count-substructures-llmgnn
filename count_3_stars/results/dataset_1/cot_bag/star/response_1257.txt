Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the graph to find the total number of 3-stars.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 4.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 9.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, and 7.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 9.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 5.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, and 9.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
