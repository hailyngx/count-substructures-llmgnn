Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 3, node 4, and node 6. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \[ 10 + 1 + 4 = 15 \]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<3, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 7)>,
<6, (0, 8, 9)>.
