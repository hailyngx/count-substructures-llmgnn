Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 5, 8}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) (with neighbors {4, 8, 9})
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (with neighbors {5, 6, 8}, {5, 7, 9}, {6, 7, 8}, {7, 8, 9})
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (with neighbors {5, 7, 9}, {5, 7, 6}, {5, 9, 8}, {7, 8, 9})
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (with neighbors {2, 3, 7}, {2, 7, 6}, {3, 6, 9}, {6, 7, 9})
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (with neighbors {1, 2, 7}, {2, 8, 6}, {3, 7, 6}, {7, 8, 6})
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (with neighbors {2, 6, 8}, {3, 9, 8}, {6, 7, 8}, {7, 9, 8})
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (with neighbors {0, 3, 5}, {0, 5, 8}, {3, 5, 7}, {5, 7, 8})

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25\)

Therefore, there are a total of 25 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 6)>
<6, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (7, 8, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 9, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)> 

Therefore, the answer is [25].
