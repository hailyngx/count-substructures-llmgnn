Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with at least three neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 5 neighbors. Therefore, the number of 3-stars formed with node 0 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

2. Node 1: Node 1 has 3 neighbors. Only 1 3-star is formed with node 1.

3. Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors. Only 1 3-star is formed with node 4.

4. Node 6: Node 6 has 3 neighbors. Only 1 3-star is formed with node 6.

5. Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors. Therefore, the number of 3-stars formed with node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

6. Node 8: Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with node 8.

Summing up the 3-stars formed with each of the nodes, we get a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
