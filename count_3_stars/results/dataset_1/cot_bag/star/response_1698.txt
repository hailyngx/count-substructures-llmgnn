Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 19 \)

Putting this final number inside brackets: [19]

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
