Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
Node 0 with 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7  
Node 1 with 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8  
Node 2 with 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7  
Node 3 with 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9  
Node 4 with 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8  
Node 5 with 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7  
Node 6 with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8  
Node 7 with 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8  
Node 8 with 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7  
Node 9 with 1 neighbor: 3  

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
