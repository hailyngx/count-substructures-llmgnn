Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first draw the graph by listing the nodes with their neighbors connected by edges.

- Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 5 and Node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 0, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 6 and Node 7.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 1, Node 2, and Node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 1, Node 4, and Node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 2 and Node 7.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed in this graph by following the method described earlier.

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars.

For the nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>.
