Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we can represent the graph with its nodes and connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 5

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more connections:
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 4 has 3 connections
- Node 5 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 3 connections

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 connections
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 connections
- Node 6: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 connections

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17 \)

Therefore, in total there are [17] 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
