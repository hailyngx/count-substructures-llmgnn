Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the total number of 3-stars, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors 
- Node 2: 6 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 7)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars is [41], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>.
