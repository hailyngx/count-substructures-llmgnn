Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4}

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 1] = 15 \).

List of unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>
