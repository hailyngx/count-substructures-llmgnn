Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node, let's determine its neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (0, 4, 1)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (5, 8, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <6, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (8, 5, 8)>, <6, (8, 5, 4)>, <6, (9, 7, 2)>, <8, (1, 4, 0)>, <9, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (4, 0, 2)>
