Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first construct the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges.  

The graph can be described as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 5.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors, so it can only form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 30 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
