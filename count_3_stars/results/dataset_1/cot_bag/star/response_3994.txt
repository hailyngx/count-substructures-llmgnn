Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Total number of 3-stars: inom{10}{3} = 120

Inside brackets: [20]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9, 2)>
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 2)>
<6, (0, 9, 5)>
<6, (0, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 5, 2)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>
<2, (6, 0, 5)>
<2, (6, 0, 9)>
