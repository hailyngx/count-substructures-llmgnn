Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [26].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
