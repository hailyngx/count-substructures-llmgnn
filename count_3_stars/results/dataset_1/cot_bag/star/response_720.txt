Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see which nodes it's connected to:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 3.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 has an edge with node 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form  \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form  \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 1 = 11.

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
