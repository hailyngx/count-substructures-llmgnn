Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edge list, the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 8 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 2)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (1, 2)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (1, 7, 9)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (7, 8)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [56 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 83 \).

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
