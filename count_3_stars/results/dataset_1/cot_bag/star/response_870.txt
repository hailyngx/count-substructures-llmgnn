Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of possible 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 0, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, 0)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
<5, (8, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 0, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 1, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 9)>
<6, (9, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<9, (6, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 5, 1)>
