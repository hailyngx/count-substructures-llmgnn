Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
