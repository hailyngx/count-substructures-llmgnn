Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 2 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 6 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
