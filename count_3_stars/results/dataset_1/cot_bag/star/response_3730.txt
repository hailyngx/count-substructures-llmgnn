Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 4, node 5, and node 9.

For node 4:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars. These are:
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars. These are:
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars. These are:
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 + 4 = 18.
