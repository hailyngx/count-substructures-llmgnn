Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (4, 6, 8)>

Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>

Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 8)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 5: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<5, (4, 6, 8)>

Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 5)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<6, (0, 1, 5)>

Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 9)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Node 9: 2 neighbors (3, 8)
No 3-stars formed with this node.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
