Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
There are 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8. So, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 1: 
There are 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9. So, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 3: 
There are 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9. So, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 4: 
There are 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7. So, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9: 
There are 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3. So, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node, we get \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 33 \).

The final result, \([33]\), is the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)> 

<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>
