Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20] = 25.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 5)>
