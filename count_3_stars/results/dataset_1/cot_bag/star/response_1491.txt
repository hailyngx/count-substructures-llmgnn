Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are given by {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze the degrees of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

For nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8:
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For nodes 3 and 9:
Since they each have 3 neighbors, they can individually form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of all these, which is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 7 ,8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 2, 6)>.
