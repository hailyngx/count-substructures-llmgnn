Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 8)>

Node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>

Node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [16].
