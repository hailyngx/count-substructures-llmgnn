Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9).
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7).
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 8).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 8).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 7, 8, 9).
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6).
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 6).

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \(20 + 4 + 20 = 44\), which gives us a total of 44 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 6)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 6, 5)>
- <8, (4, 7, 5)>
- <8, (4, 7, 6)>
