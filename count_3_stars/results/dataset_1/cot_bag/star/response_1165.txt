Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Applying the method described, we start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 8, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11. 
Hence, the answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<8, (5, 0, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
