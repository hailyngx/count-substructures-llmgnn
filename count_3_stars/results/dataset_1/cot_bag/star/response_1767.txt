Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9) => [1 3-star] => <0, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 6) => [1 3-star] => <1, (0, 3, 6)>
Node 2 has 1 neighbor => No 3-stars
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7) => [1 3-star] => <3, (1, 5, 7)>
Node 4 has 2 neighbors => No 3-stars
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 8, 9) => [1 3-star] => <5, (3, 4, 8)>
Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9) => [1 3-star] => <6, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6) => [1 3-star] => <7, (2, 3, 6)>
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 9) => [1 3-star] => <8, (0, 5, 9)>
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 8) => [1 3-star] => <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Summing these up: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5.
