Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's denote the nodes as 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 for simplicity. 

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Since only nodes 5 and 6 have three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars containing these nodes.

For node 5:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of the 4.
- So, there are 4 3-stars centered at node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>.

For node 6:
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of the 5.
- So, there are 10 3-stars centered at node 6: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 7, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 10 = 14, which we denote as [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 7, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 7, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>.
