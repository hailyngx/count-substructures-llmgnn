Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To start, let's represent the given graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8)

Let's determine the number of 3-star formations in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 8 (2 neighbors)
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 7 (2 neighbors)
Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 9 (2 neighbors)
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8 (2 neighbors)
Node 5 has neighbors: 2 (1 neighbor)
Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 7 (2 neighbors)
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 (5 neighbors)
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 8 (2 neighbors)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
Total = 4 + 10 + 4 =  18

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>
