Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 2, 3

We'll now determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Nodes 1, 4, and 8 form a 3-star: <1, (4, 8, 5)>
- Nodes 2, 4, and 8 form a 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 1)>
- Nodes 3, 4, and 9 form a 3-star: <3, (4, 9, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
