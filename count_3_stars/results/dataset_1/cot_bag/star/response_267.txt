Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (1, 9)
Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6, 9)
Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 6)
Node 9: 2 neighbors (2, 4)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node and sum them up:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, there are [17] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
