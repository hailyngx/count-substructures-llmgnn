Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list down the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3

Nodes 3, 6, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, which means they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. 

So, the final answer is: [12]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 0)>
<3, (8, 0, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<6, (9, 1, 5)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<8, (1, 7, 3)>
<8, (7, 3, 1)>
<8, (3, 1, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 1)>
