Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 1

Looking at the list of neighbors, we can see that nodes 0, 2, and 4 have 3 or more neighbors, which means they can form 3-star graphs. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, there are a total of 9 3-stars in the given graph. 
Putting this final count inside brackets gives us [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
