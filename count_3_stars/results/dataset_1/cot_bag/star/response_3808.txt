Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14 \)

Therefore, [14] unique 3-stars are formed. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 4, 7)> <2, (0, 3, 7)> <3, (2, 6, 7)> <3, (4, 6, 7)> <4, (0, 1, 7)> <7, (0, 2, 3)> <7, (0, 3, 4)> <7, (2, 3, 4)> <0, (7, 8, -)> <7, (0, 8, -)> <0, (3, 9, -)> <3, (0, 9, -)> <9, (3, 8, -)> <8, (0, 9, -)>
