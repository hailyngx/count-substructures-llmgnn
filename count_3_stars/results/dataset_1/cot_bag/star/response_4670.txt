Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Four 3-stars)

So, there are a total of 1 + 4 = 5 3-stars in the given graph.

Putting the final count inside brackets []: [5]
The unique 3-stars found are: <7, (1, 2, 9)>
