Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first look at each node to determine if it has three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by that node.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
<1, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 2 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
<3, (4, 5, 6)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
<4, (3, 6, 8)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
<5, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 6 has 6 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>

Node 7 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Node 9 has 2 neighbors (less than 3), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 9. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
