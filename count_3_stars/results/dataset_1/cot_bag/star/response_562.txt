Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
