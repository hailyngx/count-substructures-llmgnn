Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<0, (6, 1, 2)>
<0, (6, 4, 2)>
<0, (9, 1, 5)>
<0, (9, 5, 1)>

Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars

Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have [8].
