Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 4.
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Unique 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 3, 4)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Unique 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 4, 5)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8, 8, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Unique 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
