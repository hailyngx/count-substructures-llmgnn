Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes.

Let's start by listing the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
