Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
- There are 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- There is 1 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 9)>.

For node 1:
- There are 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- There are 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>.

For node 4:
- There are 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- There are 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>.

For node 5:
- There are 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- There are 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>.

For node 9:
- There are 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- There are 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [17].
