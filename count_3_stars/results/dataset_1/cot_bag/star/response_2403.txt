Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can draw the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, and 9: <1, (3, 5, 9)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 6, and 8: <2, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 6: <5, (1, 2, 6)>.
- Node 5 also forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 6, and 8: <5, (2, 6, 8)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 7, and 8: <5, (6, 7, 8)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
