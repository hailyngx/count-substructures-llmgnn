Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0, it has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 9), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 1, it has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 8), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 1 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 5, it has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 8, it has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 8 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 9, it has 2 neighbors (0, 8), so the number of 3-stars formed with node 9 is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) since it does not have enough neighbors.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10.

So, the final answer is [10].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<0, (1, 5, 2)>, 
<0, (1, 5, 0)>, 
<1, (0, 5, 8)>,
<5, (0, 1, 2)>,
<5, (0, 1, 5)>,
<5, (0, 1, 1)>,
<8, (1, 6, 9)>,
<8, (1, 6, 0)>.
