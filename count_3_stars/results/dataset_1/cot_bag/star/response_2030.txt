Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>
Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <8, (2, 6, 9)>
Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 14.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (4, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, and <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
