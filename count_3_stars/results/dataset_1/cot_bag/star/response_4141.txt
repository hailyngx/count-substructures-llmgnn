Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:
   
                        1 - 5
                       /   /
                      0 - 2 - 6
                       \ /   /
                        8   3 - 7 - 9
                               \ /
                                4
   
    We can see that some nodes have 3 or more neighbors, which means there are potential 3-stars in this graph. Let's identify them: 
    - Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8): inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
    - Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6): inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 9): inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
    - Node 3 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7): inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
    - Node 7 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9): inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
  
  So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 11.
  
  The unique 3-stars are: 
  <0, 1, 2>, <2, 3, 4>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 8>, <3, 4, 6>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 7>, <0, 2, 9>
