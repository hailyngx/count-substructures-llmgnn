Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbor {9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbor {0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
