Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Here is the list of 3-stars formed in this graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 8, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 1)>
