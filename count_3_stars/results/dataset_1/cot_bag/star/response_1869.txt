Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
