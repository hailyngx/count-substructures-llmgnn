Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors. [1]
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors. [1]
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors. [1]
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors. [1]
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors. [1]
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors. [1]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors. [1]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 7, 8>
<1, 0, 2, 6>
<1, 0, 2, 8>
<1, 2, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4, 8>
