Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Node 1, 3, and 9 each have at least 3 neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 10 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 9) = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 7, 3)>
- <1, (4, 9, 1)>
- <1, (5, 1, 7)>
- <1, (7, 3, 1)>
- <1, (5, 8, 1)>
- <3, (1, 7, 2)>
- <3, (1, 9, 4)>
- <3, (9, 4, 1)>
- <9, (0, 3, 1)>
