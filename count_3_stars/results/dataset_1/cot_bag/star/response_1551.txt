Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 7.
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 27 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [27].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
