Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars:

For node 0: It has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 8, 9). So, it can form a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 1: It has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 8). So, it can form only 1 3-star.

For node 5: It has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 9). So, it can form a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 6: It has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 9). So, it can form only 1 3-star.

In total, there are \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>.
