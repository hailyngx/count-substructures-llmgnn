Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 1 is connected to node 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 7
- Node 5 is connected to node 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (6, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, and they are: <3, (6, 7, 9)> and <7, (2, 4, 9)>.

Putting the final count in brackets, we have [2].
