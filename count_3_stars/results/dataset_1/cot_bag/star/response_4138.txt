Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph:
```
       1----5----7
       |    |\   |
       |    | \  |
       7    6  8  8
            \ |  /
             \| /
              3
              |
              2
```
Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, and 1 (forms one 3-star)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, and 5 (forms one 3-star)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, and 3 (forms one 3-star)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, and 8 (forms one 3-star)

Thus, there are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
- <1, 5, 7>
- <5, 1, 7>
- <3, 2, 8>
- <8, 3, 6>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
