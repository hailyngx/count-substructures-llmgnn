Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this graph are:

\[ [4] \]

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (3)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
