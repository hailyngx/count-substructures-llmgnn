Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of \(1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
