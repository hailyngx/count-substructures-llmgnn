Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 24, so we will write this as [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (7, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (8, 4, 9)>
