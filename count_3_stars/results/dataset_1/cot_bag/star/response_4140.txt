Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For Node 0: 
Since Node 0 has 3 neighbors, we have 1 3-star with Node 0 as the center: <0, (6, 7, 9)>

For Node 1: 
Since Node 1 has 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.
The unique 3-stars with Node 1 are: 
<1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>

For the rest of the nodes (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9):
These nodes do not have 3 or more neighbors, so no additional 3-stars are formed with these nodes.

Summing up the 3-stars, we get a total of 11 3-stars: [11].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>
