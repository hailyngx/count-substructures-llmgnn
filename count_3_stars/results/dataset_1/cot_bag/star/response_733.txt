Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0,5), (0,8), (1,5), (1,6), (1,8), (2,4), (4,2), (4,9), (5,0), (5,1), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,1), (6,5), (6,7), (6,8), (7,5), (7,6), (7,8), (8,0), (8,1), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,9), (9,4), (9,8)

Let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9 (6 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these two, we get a total of 30 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
