Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is \([20 + 1 + 10] = 31\).

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 3, 9)>, <3, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>.

So, the final answer is "[31]".
