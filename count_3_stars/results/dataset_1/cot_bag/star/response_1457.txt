Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
We will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors since those are the only nodes that can form 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 0, 5)>
