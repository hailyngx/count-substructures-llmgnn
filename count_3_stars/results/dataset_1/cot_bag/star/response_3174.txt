Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8)
(1, 0), (1, 3)
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9)
(4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9)
(5, 4), (5, 8)
(6, 0), (6, 9)
(7, 4)
(8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5)
(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Nodes 8 and 9 can each form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
