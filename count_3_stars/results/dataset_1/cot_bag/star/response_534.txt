Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the provided information:

```
     1 -- 0 -- 2
    / \   |  
   4   9 6 -- 5 -- 7
              |
              8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 5)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
