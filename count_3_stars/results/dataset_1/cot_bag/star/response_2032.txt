Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to see which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 3, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 3, 7)>
- <6, (7, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
