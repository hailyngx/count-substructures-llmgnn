Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will now list the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0: [] (since it has only 4 neighbors)
For node 1: [] (since it has 5 neighbors)
For node 4: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
For node 8: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
For node 9: [] (since it has 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
