Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to determine the 3-stars:

Node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Number of 3-stars: C(3, 3) = 1
- 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 2:
- Neighbors: 0, 8
- Number of 3-stars: C(2, 3) = 0

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars: C(3, 3) = 1
- 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars: C(2, 3) = 0

Node 6:
- Neighbors: 4, 7
- Number of 3-stars: C(2, 3) = 0

Node 7:
- Neighbors: 0, 3, 6
- Number of 3-stars: C(3, 3) = 1
- 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 6)>

Node 8:
- Neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4
- 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 5)>

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 8
- Number of 3-stars: C(1, 3) = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0] = [7].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 5)>.
