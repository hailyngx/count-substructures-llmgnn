Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0: Connects to 3 nodes (1, 5, 9)
Node 1: Connects to 8 nodes (0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9)
Node 2: Connects to 4 nodes (1, 4, 6, 9)
Node 3: Connects to 2 nodes (4, 9)
Node 4: Connects to 3 nodes (2, 3, 5)
Node 5: Connects to 4 nodes (0, 1, 4, 7)
Node 6: Connects to 3 nodes (1, 2, 9)
Node 7: Connects to 1 node (5)
Node 8: Connects to 2 nodes (1, 9)
Node 9: Connects to 6 nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8)

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing these up: 1 + 56 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 87

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [87].

Now, let's represent the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 0)>, <1, (8, 9, 2)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>.
