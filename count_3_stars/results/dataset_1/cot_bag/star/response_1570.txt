Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 0: This node has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 5, 7), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: This node has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 7, 8, 9), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: This node has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 5, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, and <4, (1, 5, 8)>.
