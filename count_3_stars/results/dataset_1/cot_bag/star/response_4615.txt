Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Based on the given information, the number of 3-stars can be calculated. We will now list the unique 3-stars and count the total.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.

Calculating for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>
  
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <1, (2, 3, 8)>
  
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <3, (1, 5, 8)>
  
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <5, (0, 3, 8)>
  
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <6, (0, 4, 7)>
  
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
