Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
To begin, let's create the graph based on the information provided:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
