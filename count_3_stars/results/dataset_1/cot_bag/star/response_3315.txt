Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 9: {2, 7}

We see that only Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, and Node 5 have 3 or more neighbors, which means they can each form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of \( 4+4+4+4 = 16 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets gives us: [16].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>

<2, (1, 5, 3)>
<2, (5, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 5)>

<5, (2, 4, 8)>
