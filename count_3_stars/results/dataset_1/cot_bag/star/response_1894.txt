Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors and can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors and can form 3 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 3] = [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 2, 4, 9>
<4, 0, 9, 7>
<9, 0, 1, 4>
<9, 1, 7, 0>
<9, 4, 0, 7>
