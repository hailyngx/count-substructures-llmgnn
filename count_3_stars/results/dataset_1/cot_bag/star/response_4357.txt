Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 31.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>

- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>

- <9, (5, 0, 8)>
- <9, (5, 2, 8)>
- <9, (5, 8, 0)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
