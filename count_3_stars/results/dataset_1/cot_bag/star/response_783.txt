Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
- The 3-stars are: <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 4)>.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 9)>.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the answer is [26].
The unique 3-stars are: <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
