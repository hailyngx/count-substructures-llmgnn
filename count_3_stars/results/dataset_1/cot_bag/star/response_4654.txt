Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, namely nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula mentioned above:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [1]
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: [1]
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: [10]
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: [15]
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 10 + 15] = 27.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <1, 0, 8>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <2, 0, 9>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <8, 0, 1>
- <8, 1, 4>
- <8, 1, 5>
- <8, 1, 6>
- <8, 1, 7>
- <8, 4, 5>
- <8, 4, 6>
- <8, 4, 7>
- <8, 5, 6>
- <8, 5, 7>
- <8, 6, 7>
- <9, 2, 7>
