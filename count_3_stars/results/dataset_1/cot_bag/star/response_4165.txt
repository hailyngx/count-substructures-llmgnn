Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

We see that nodes 3 and 9 have 4 neighbors, so they can potentially form 4 3-stars each.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can potentially form 3 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 3] = 11.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 0, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 3, 0)>
<9, (4, 3, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 8)>
