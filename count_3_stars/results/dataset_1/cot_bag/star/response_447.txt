Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, for each such node, we calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of.

The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 4)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 4)>, <6, (2, 5, 4)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
