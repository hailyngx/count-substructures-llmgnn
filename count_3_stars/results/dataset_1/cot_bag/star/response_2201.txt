Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To begin, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We can then calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes form.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 3, 9)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 7, 8)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 4, 6, 7)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 9)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 7, 8)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 4, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 3, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <9, (0, 3, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, and <8, (1, 4, 9)>.
