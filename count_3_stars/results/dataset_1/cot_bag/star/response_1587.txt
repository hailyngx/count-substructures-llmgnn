Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, and 6.

For node 2, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 3, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>

For node 6, there are 3 possible 3-stars: 
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9].
