Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 and the given edges connect the nodes as described. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

For each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Iterating through each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44.

So, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the given graph.
