Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
    1 ---- 3 ---- 4
    |      |      |
    0 ---- 6 ---- 2
          |      |
          9 ---- 5
               |
               8
               |
               7
```

Based on the given edges, the nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph by calculating the total number of 3-stars formed around each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in this graph are: 
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
