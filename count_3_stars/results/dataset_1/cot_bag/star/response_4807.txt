Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.  
Looking at the provided edges, we can create the following adjacency list for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6.

Now, we'll go through each node to check how many potential 3-stars they could be a part of:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, which is exactly 3, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors which is less than the required 3.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors which is less than the required 3.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors which is less than the required 3.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors which is less than the required 3.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of [4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 26 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 6, 8>
- <1, 2, 6, 7>
- <1, 3, 6, 7>
- <1, 5, 6, 7>
