Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9)
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 0 and 3, since they have exactly 3 neighbors, each forms one 3-star.
- For nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9, we will apply \( \binom{k}{3} \) where k is the number of neighbors for each node.

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from nodes 0 and 3) + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the final answer is [45].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>.
