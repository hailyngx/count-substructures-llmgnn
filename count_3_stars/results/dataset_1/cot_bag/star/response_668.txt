Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 5, 7, and 9. 
Letâ€™s calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star. 
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star. 

The total number of 3-stars would be 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 41. 

Therefore, the final answer is [41]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>
