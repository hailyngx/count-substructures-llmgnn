Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the nodes to find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (0, 8), (0, 9), (6, 8).
    - This forms 1 unique 3-star: <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (2, 5), (4, 5), (5, 8), (5, 9).
    - This forms 1 unique 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: (0, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8).
    - This forms 1 unique 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (0, 9), (3, 9), (5, 9), (7, 9).
    - This forms 1 unique 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (node 3) + 1 (node 5) + 1 (node 8) + 1 (node 9) = 4
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>.
