Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 0:
   Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9), so there is a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
      
2. For node 1:
   Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 7), so there is a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
   
3. For node 2:
   Node 2 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 9), so there is a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   
4. For node 9:
   Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5, 7), so there is a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
