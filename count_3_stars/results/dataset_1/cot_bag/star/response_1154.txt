Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
This graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 9), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: Has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1: Has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8), so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 8, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
