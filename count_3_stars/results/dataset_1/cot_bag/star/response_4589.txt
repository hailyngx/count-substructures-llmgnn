Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 1: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 8: $\binom{5}{3}=10$
- Node 9: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: $1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 37$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 37.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)> 

So, the final result is: [37].
