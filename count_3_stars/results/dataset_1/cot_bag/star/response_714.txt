Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 10] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
