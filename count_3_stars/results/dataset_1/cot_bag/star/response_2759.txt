Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1, there are 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 8), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7) so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, there are 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3) so 1 3-star.
For node 7, there are 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5) so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, there are 2 neighbors (1, 9), so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19 \) 3-stars. Hence, the final result is [19].

Unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 7)>
