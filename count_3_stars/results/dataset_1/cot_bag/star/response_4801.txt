Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with the given nodes and edges to visualize it:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. We will analyze each node to see how many 3-stars it participates in:

- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9), so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 2: Has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 8), so it participates in 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 7), so it participates in 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: Has 6 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9), so it participates in 20 3-stars.
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9), so it participates in 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4), so it participates in 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: Has 2 neighbors (2, 5), so it does not participate in any 3-star.
- Node 9: Has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6), so it participates in 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
