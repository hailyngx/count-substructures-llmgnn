Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes for the 3-stars. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {4, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {5, 8}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 8}
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {1, 4, 8}
Node 8 has 7 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each potential central node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 
\[ 4 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 41 \]

So, there are [41] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
