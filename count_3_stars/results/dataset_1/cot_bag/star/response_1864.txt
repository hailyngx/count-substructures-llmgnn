Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 5
 \    | \
  7 - 8 - 1
    \ | /
      9

2 --- 3
    /
   7
    \
     4

6
```

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<1, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 1)>, <7, (8, 2, 6)>, <7, (8, 2, 9)>, <7, (8, 6, 9)>, <7, (8, 6, 1)>, <7, (9, 4, 6)>, <7, (9, 4, 8)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 8, 1)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 1)>, <7, (6, 8, 1)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 1, 9)>, <7, (6, 1, 9)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>, <8, (7, 2, 4)>, <8, (7, 2, 6)>, <8, (9, 2, 4)>

Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 8, 1)>, <9, (0, 8, 5)>, <9, (7, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (7, 8, 2)>, <9, (7, 4, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 6)>, <9, (1, 8, 5)>, <9, (8, 2, 4)>, <9, (8, 2, 6)>, <9, (8, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (7, 4, 1)>, <9, (7, 4, 6)>, <9, (7, 1, 6)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (8, 6, 3)>, <9, (7, 6, 3)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 56 3-stars, represented inside brackets as [56].
