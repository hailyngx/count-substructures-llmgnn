Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 8

We'll now calculate the total number of 3-stars. Starting with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 
\[ [1+1+1+1+1+1+1] = [7] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
