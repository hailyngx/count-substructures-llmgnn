Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: 3, 5  
Node 1: 2, 3, 8  
Node 2: 1, 7  
Node 3: 0, 1, 5  
Node 4: 6, 7, 8  
Node 5: 0, 3, 7  
Node 6: 4, 7  
Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8  
Node 8: 1, 4, 7  

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars with it: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Let's list the unique 3-stars:  
<7, (2, 4, 5)>  
<7, (2, 4, 6)>  
<7, (2, 4, 8)>  
<7, (2, 5, 6)>  
<7, (2, 5, 8)>  
<7, (2, 6, 8)>  
<7, (4, 5, 6)>  
<7, (4, 5, 8)>  
<7, (4, 6, 8)>  
<7, (5, 6, 8)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars, so the total number of 3-stars is [10].
