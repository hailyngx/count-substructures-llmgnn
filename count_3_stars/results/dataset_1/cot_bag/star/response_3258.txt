Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, node 3, and node 4.

For node 0:
- It has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 3, 4)>

For node 1:
- It has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 6, 8)>

For node 3:
- It has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 4, 6)>

For node 4:
- It has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 3, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars in the graph: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>
