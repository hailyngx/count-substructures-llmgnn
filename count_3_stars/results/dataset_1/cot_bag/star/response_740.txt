Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their neighbors:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>
