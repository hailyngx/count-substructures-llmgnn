Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we construct the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges. The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3

Now, we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9 are the nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0 and 9, they have exactly 3 neighbors, so each contributes 1 3-star.
- For nodes 4 and 7, they have 4 neighbors each, leading to \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node.

Therefore, we find a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10 3-stars in this graph. Listing them uniquely, we have:
\[ [10] \]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>
