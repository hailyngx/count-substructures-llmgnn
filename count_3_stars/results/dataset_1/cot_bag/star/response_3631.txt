Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, node 4, node 8, and node 9. These are the potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these potential central nodes:

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 has 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, 9).
    - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars formed: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>.

2. Node 2:
    - Node 2 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 6, 8).
    - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars formed: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>.

3. Node 4:
    - Node 4 has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9).
    - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Unique 3-stars formed: <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>.

4. Node 8:
    - Node 8 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7).
    - Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars formed: <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>.

5. Node 9:
    - Node 9 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 4).
    - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars formed: <9, (0, 1, 4)>.

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
