Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to node 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to node 8
- Node 6 is connected to node 4
- Node 7 is connected to node 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars by checking each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 8: <1, (4, 7, 8)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 5: <8, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 3: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
