Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in the given graph: nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- There is 1 3-star formed with node 8.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 35.

Therefore, there are [35] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 2, 5)>
- <2, (4, 2, 6)>
- <2, (4, 2, 9)>
- <2, (5, 2, 6)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (6, 0, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 6)>
- <6, (3, 0, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 2, 6)>
- <6, (5, 3, 7)>
