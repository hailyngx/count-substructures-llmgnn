Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

For node 0: 
There are three neighbors: 4, 6, and 7. So, the number of 3-stars for node 0 is 1.

For node 4: 
There are six neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars for node 4 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 6: 
There are four neighbors: 0, 3, 8, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars for node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7: 
There are four neighbors: 0, 5, 8, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars for node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9: 
There are five neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars for node 9 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10] is 39.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
