Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
