Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
