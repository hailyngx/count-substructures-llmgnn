Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 3
- Node 1 is connected to Node 2 and Node 4
- Node 2 is connected to Node 1
- Node 3 is connected to Node 0, Node 4, and Node 5
- Node 4 is connected to Node 1, Node 3, and Node 8
- Node 5 is connected to Node 3
- Node 6 is connected to Node 9
- Node 8 is connected to Node 4
- Node 9 is connected to Node 6

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
- Thus, Node 3 can form 1 3-star

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8
- Thus, Node 4 can form 1 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
