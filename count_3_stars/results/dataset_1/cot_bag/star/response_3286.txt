Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 3), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 and Node 9 also have 3 neighbors each, so they can each form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>

So, the final result is [16], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>.
