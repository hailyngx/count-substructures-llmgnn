Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 7

Based on the neighbors of each node, we can identify the 3-stars and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 2)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 1)>, <2, (8, 1, 4)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 2)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 1)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 1)>, <7, (2, 1, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 0)>, <7, (4, 8, 3)>, <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 1)>, <7, (4, 1, 5)>, <7, (8, 3, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (8, 1, 5)>, <7, (8, 5, 0)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4] = 37.
