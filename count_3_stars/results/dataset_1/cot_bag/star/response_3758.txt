Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 5, 7

We can see that nodes 0, 5, and 7 have 5, 4, and 3 neighbors respectively, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (0, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 1] = [15] \).
