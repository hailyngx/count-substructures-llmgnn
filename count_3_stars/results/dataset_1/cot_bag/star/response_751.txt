Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 22 \)

So, there are 22 3-stars in this graph.
Putting the final number in brackets: [22]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
