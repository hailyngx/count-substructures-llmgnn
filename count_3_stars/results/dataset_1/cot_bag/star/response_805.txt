Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
  0 -- 4       6 -- 9
  |             | /
  |             |/
  4 -- 5 -- 7 -- 1
  |           |  |
  |           |  |
  7 -- 6       3
```

We can see that nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. Therefore, the number of 3-stars centered at node 1 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
The unique 3-star formed with node 1 is <1, (3, 7, 9)>.

For node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7. Therefore, the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
The unique 3-star formed with node 4 is <4, (0, 5, 7)>.

For node 5:
Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7. Therefore, the number of 3-stars centered at node 5 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
The unique 3-star formed with node 5 is <5, (4, 6, 7)>.

For node 7:
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the number of 3-stars centered at node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
The unique 3-stars formed with node 7 are <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>.

For node 9:
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8. Therefore, the number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
The unique 3-stars formed with node 9 are <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [17].
