Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, the nodes that have at least three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars = <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars = <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 1)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars = <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star = <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars = <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars = <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [27].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 1)>, <1, (6, 7, 1)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
