Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Node 2:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Node 7:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

There are no 3-stars in the graph involving nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 because they do not have at least 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 20.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
