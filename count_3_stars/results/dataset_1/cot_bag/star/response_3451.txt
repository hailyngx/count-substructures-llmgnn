Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 4)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 7, 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6] \)

Therefore, there are 6 3-stars in this graph. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
