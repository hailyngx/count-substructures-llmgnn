Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 8), (4, 9), (6, 0), (6, 9), (7, 2), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8) - It has 3 neighbors
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 9) - It has 3 neighbors
Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 8), (4, 9) - It has 3 neighbors
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 9) - It has 5 neighbors
Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8) - It has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, and <8, (0, 1, 3)>.
