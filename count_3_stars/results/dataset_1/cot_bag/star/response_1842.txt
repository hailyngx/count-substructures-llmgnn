Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 9), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 0), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {3, 9}
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 0}
Node 4 has 1 neighbor: {0}
Node 5 has 1 neighbor: {6}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 9}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {0, 3, 6}
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 40 \)

So, the final answer is [40].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>.
