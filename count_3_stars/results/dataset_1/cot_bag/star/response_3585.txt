Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 = 11.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [11].
