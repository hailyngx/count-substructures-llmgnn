Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (5,(3,4,6))
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (8,(1,5,7))

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [2]

Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>
