Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6
- Node 9 is connected to node 6

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Adding these together, we have a total of 4 + 35 = 39 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [39], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
