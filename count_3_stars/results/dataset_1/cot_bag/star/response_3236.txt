Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {5}

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
