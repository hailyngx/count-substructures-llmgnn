Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph using the method described earlier:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 3, 7)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with node 6 as the center.

- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with them as centers.

Putting this all together, we have a total of [10 + 1] = [11] 3-stars in the graph.
