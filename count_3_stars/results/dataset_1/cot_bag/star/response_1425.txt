Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with at least three neighbors:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 also has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 9 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 8, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, 7)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 0)>
<9, (3, 5, 1)>
