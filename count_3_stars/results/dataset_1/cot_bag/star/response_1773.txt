Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

We see that nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

For node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [29] \).
