Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 has neighbors 2, 3, 4, and 9.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with 0 as the center: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>

2. Node 2:
   - Node 2 has neighbors 0, 8, and 9.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with 2 as the center: <2, (0, 8, 9)>

3. Node 4:
   - Node 4 has neighbors 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with 4 as the center: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 = 15
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>
