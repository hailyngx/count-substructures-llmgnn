Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more edges are: 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9.
  
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 35 + 4 + 1] = [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 0, 4)>, <0, (3, 0, 8)>, <0, (4, 1, 5)>, <0, (4, 1, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>
