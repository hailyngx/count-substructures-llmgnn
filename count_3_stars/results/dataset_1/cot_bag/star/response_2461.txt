Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 7
Node 1: 8
Node 2: 0, 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 5, 8
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 6: 2, 5, 9
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 1, 3
Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
