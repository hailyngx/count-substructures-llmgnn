Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

From the given edge list, we can see that:
- Node 0 has neighbors 7, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 6
- Node 5 has neighbors 3, 4, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 7
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 5, 8

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 0)>
<8, (1, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
