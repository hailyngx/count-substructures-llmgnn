Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is equal to [10+4+10+10] = [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
