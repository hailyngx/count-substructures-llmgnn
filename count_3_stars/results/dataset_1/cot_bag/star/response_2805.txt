Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph:
```
    1 --- 6
   /|\    
  / | \   
 0  |  7 
   \|/| 
    2-3
     | |
     4-5
          \
           9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 3)> 
- Node 3 can form 3 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 can form 3 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [1+3+3] = [7].
