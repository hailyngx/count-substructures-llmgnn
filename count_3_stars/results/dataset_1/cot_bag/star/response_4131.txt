Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we first identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors: nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9. 

1. Node 2:
    - Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, and 9.
    - Applying \( \binom{4}{3} \) gives us 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
        - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
        - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
        - <2, (1, 3, 9)>
        - <2, (7, 3, 9)>

2. Node 4:
    - Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 7 and 9.
    - As there are less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with node 4.

3. Node 7:
    - Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 8.
    - Applying \( \binom{4}{3} \) gives us 4 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
        - <7, (2, 4, 5)>
        - <7, (2, 4, 8)>
        - <7, (2, 5, 8)>
        - <7, (4, 5, 8)>

4. Node 9:
    - Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
    - Applying \( \binom{5}{3} \) gives us 10 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
        - <9, (0, 2, 4)>
        - <9, (0, 2, 5)>
        - <9, (0, 2, 6)>
        - <9, (0, 4, 5)>
        - <9, (0, 4, 6)>
        - <9, (0, 5, 6)>
        - <9, (2, 4, 5)>
        - <9, (2, 4, 6)>
        - <9, (2, 5, 6)>
        - <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 10] = 18.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (7, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>.
