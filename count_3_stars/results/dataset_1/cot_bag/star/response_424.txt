Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.

For node 0, there are 3 neighbors: 5, 8, and 9. The number of 3-stars around node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\). 

For node 1, there are 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 7. The number of 3-stars around node 1 is also \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\).

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, and 7. The number of 3-stars around node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\).

For node 7, there are 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 9. The number of 3-stars around node 7 is also \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\).

For node 9, there are 3 neighbors: 0, 7, and 9. The number of 3-stars around node 9 is also \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, and <7, (1, 4, 9)>.
