Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 -- 6
    |     |
    6 -- 9
    |     |
    2 -- 3 -- 5 -- 7
          |     |
          9     2
          |
          4 -- 8
```

Next, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (6), so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9), so it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: Has 1 neighbor (8), so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 5: Has 3 neighbors (3, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Has 1 neighbor (5), so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 8: Has 1 neighbor (4), so it forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 9: Has 3 neighbors (3, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7], and they are:
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 2)>
- <5, (3, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 2)>
