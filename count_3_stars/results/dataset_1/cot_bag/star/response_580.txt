Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 8 neighbors  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors  

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
- For node 0: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars  
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Adding these up, we have a total of 76 3-stars.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 9, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>  

So the final answer is [76].
