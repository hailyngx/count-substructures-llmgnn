Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we need to determine the total number of 3-star configurations in the graph.

Let's examine how many neighbors each node has:
- Node 0 : 3 neighbors
- Node 1 : 1 neighbor
- Node 2 : 3 neighbors
- Node 3 : 1 neighbor
- Node 4 : 1 neighbor
- Node 5 : 3 neighbors
- Node 6 : 4 neighbors
- Node 7 : 1 neighbor
- Node 8 : 2 neighbors
- Node 9 : 1 neighbor

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- For Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 3-stars in the graph.

So, the final answer is [7] and the 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
