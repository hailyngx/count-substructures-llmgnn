Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 1 to 10, and the given edges are as follows:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node, we will check if it has three or more neighbors. If it does, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node. 

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Possible 3-stars involving node 2: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Possible 3-stars involving node 4: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Possible 3-stars involving node 5: <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 2)>, <5, (2, 4, 1)>.

There are a total of 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [12].
