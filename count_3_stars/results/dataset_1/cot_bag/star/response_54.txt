Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8
- Node 7 is connected to node 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9 is connected to node 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 8. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7. It forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6. It forms 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
