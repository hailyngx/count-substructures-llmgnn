Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
