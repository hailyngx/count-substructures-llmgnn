Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges based on the given edge list:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.

Now, let's analyze the nodes to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 9) = 6.
So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
