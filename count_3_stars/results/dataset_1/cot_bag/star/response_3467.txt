Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the visual representation of the graph:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 3 -- 6
    |         |      
    7         9      
    |         |      
    8 -- 4 -- 2 -- 5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 9)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 3: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 4: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 7: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 9: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $

Adding these up, we have a total of 8 3-stars: [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
