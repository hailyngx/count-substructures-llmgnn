Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 25.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 2, 3)>
<0, (7, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

So, the final answer is [25].
