Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 8). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9). Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
