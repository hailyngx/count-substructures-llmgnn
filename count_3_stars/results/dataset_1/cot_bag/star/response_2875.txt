Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can first represent the connections visually: 

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3,1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), 
(4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 9), 
(9, 1), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 20 + 1 + 1] = 26 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
