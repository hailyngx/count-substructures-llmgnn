Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's identify the 3-stars present:

From the edge list, we can see that:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 6, 9
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the individual 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For Node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For Node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

For Node 8:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19]. The unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>.
