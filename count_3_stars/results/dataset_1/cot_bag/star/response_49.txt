Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 4, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2 (2 neighbors)

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
