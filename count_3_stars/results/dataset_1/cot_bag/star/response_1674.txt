Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can represent the connections visually: 

```
   0
  / \
 2 - 1 - 5 - 9
  \ /   \ /
   6     7 
         |
         8
```

Looking at each node:
- Node 0 does not have at least 3 edges connected, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 only has 1 edge connected, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 only has 1 edge connected, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 edges connected, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more edges connected and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <2, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <5, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <5, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Total 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \)

Thus, the final answer is [36].
