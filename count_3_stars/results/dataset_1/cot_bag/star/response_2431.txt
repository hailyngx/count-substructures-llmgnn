Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to node 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 8), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 8, 9), so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 7), so it forms 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
