Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are only two nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: node 0 and node 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Number of ways to choose 3 out of 5 neighbors of node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- So there are 10 3-stars with node 0 as the central node: 
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>,  <0, (1, 6, 7)>, 
    - <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, 
    - <0, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Number of ways to choose 3 out of 4 neighbors of node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- So there are 4 3-stars with node 2 as the central node: 
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4] = [14]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
