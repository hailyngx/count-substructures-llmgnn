Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

There are a total of [20 + 1 + 10 = 31] 3-stars.
Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 4, 8)>
