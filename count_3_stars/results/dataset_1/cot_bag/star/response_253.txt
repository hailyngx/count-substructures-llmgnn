Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0:
There are ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.

For node 3:
There are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.

For node 8:
There are ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.

For node 9:
There are ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of $10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 25$ 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>
