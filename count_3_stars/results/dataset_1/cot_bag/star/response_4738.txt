Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can identify the nodes with their neighbors as follows:

- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6, 8

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 1, there are 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars.
For Node 2, there are 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars.
For Node 4, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. The 3-star is <4, (0, 2, 7)>.
For Node 6, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. The 3-star is <6, (3, 7, 9)>.
For Node 7, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, and <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
For Node 9, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, and <9, (1, 5, 8)>.

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars found in this graph is:

<4, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>.
