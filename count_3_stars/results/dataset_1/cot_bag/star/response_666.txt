Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Following the calculation mentioned earlier: 
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 
\[ [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [27] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
