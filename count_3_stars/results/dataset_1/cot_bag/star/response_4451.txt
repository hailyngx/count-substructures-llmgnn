Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 3, 8  
Node 1: 0, 6  
Node 2: 3, 5, 8  
Node 3: 0, 2  
Node 4: 5, 9  
Node 5: 2, 4, 7  
Node 6: 1, 8  
Node 7: 5  
Node 8: 0, 2, 6  
Node 9: 4  

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.  

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, 1, 3>  
<2, 4, 5>  
<5, 7, 4>  
<8, 0, 2>
