Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star. 
Starting with node 0, it has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, and 8; hence, it can form 1 3-star. 
Moving on to node 1, it has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, and 7; thus, node 1 can create 1 3-star. 
Node 2 has 5 neighbors but only 3 of them are unique: 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. Hence, there are 10 3-stars that can form with node 2. 
Node 3 has 5 neighbors but only 4 unique neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Thus, there are 5 3-stars that can form with node 3. 
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars. 
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, and 9, hence it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 6 has 5 neighbors but only 4 unique neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7. So, there are 5 3-stars that can form with node 6. 
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 6, and thus forms 1 3-star. 
Node 8 has 4 unique neighbors: 0, 2, 3, and 5, so it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 9 has 3 unique neighbors: 2, 3, and 5, and can create 1 3-star. 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26.

Thus, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in the graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>.
