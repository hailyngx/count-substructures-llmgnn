Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 7
- 1 is connected to 6 and 9
- 3 is connected to 5
- 4 is connected to 7
- 5 is connected to 3, 6, 7
- 6 is connected to 1, 5
- 7 is connected to 0, 4, 5, 9
- 9 is connected to 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars.

For node 7, there are 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
For node 1, there are 2 neighbors (6, 9), so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 9, there are 2 neighbors (1, 7), so it can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
