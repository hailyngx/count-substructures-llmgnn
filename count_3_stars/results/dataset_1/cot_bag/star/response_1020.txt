Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

We can see that nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they form. 

Number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17 \).

So, the final answer is [17]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (8, 9, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, 5)>
<2, (8, 7, 3)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
