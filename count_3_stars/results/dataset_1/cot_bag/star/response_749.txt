Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
This graph consists of the following nodes connected by the specified edges:

- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4.

Considering each node, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 8: <7, (0, 4, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars formed in the graph gives us [3].
