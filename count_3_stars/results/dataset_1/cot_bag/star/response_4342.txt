Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Here is the list of 3-stars and the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
