Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars.  
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, node 6 has 5 neighbors, and node 9 has 3 neighbors.  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.  
  
For node 0, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
For node 6, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 9, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
  
Adding these up, we get a total of 15 3-stars in this graph.  

Therefore, the final answer is [15].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 4, 6)>  
<0, (2, 4, 6)>  
<0, (4, 6, 8)>  
<0, (6, 4, 8)>  
<6, (0, 4, 8)>  
<6, (0, 4, 9)>  
<6, (3, 4, 9)>  
<6, (4, 8, 9)>  
<6, (8, 4, 9)>  
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
