Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we look at nodes with degree 3 or more. In this case, nodes 3, 4, and 6 have degrees of 4, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = 10 choose 3 = 120

For Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4

For Node 6:
- Number of 3-stars = 4 choose 3 = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [120 + 4 + 4] = [128].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
