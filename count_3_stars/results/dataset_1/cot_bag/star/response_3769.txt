Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
We will first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
