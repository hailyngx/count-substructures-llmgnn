Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars from each of them:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \[ 4 + 1 + 20 = 25 \].
