Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and the corresponding edges of the graph are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8

Now, let's identify which nodes have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [11] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
