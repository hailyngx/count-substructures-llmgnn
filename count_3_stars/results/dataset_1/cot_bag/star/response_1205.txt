Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Since nodes 2, 4, and 5 have exactly 3 neighbors, they each form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 27\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 4)>
- <0, (2, 7, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
