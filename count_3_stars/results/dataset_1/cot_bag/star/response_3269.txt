Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: 1 3-star
- For node 5: 1 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 
10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 9) = 28.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (2, 1, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (7, 1, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 1)>, <1, (2, 0, 7)>, <1, (5, 3, 7)>, <1, (7, 0, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>.
