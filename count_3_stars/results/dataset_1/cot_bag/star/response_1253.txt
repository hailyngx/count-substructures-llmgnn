Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.  

For node 1, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).  
For node 3, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  
For node 4, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).  
For node 8, the number of 3-stars formed is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).  

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19 \).  
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [19].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<1, (0, 3, 6)>  
<3, (0, 2, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 7)>  
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
