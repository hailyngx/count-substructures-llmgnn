Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 3, 6

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. Only nodes with three or more neighbors can form 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3 can form 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4 can form 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5 can form 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8 can form 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

There is a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, resulting in the final answer:
\[ [ 4 ] \]
The unique 3-stars are:
< 2, (4, 3, 5) >
< 3, (4, 5, 9) >
< 4, (2, 3, 5) >
< 5, (0, 3, 4) >
