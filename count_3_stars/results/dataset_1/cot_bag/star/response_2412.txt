Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 3, 8, 9>
- <1, 7, 6, 8>
- <1, 7, 6, 9>
- <2, 4, 8, 9>
- <2, 4, 5, 6>
- <2, 4, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 5, 9>
- <2, 5, 6, 8>
- <2, 5, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 8, 9>
