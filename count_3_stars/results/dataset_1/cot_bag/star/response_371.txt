Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
