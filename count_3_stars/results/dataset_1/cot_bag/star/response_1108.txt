Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 8), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 6)}

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: Degree = 2 < 3 (No 3-stars)
2. Node 2: Degree = 2 < 3 (No 3-stars)
3. Node 3: Degree = 5 ≥ 3
   - Possible 3-stars: [✓]
4. Node 5: Degree = 2 < 3 (No 3-stars)
5. Node 6: Degree = 2 < 3 (No 3-stars)
6. Node 8: Degree = 2 < 3 (No 3-stars)
7. Node 9: Degree = 1 < 3 (No 3-stars)

In total, there is 1 3-star in this graph, which can be represented as follows:

Total number of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 8, 9)>
