Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Total 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>

Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Total 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 8, 9)>

Node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Total 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Total 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 8
- Total 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 5, 8)>

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Total 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (0, 2, 6)>

Node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2, 4
- Total 3-stars with node 9 as the center: Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 21 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
