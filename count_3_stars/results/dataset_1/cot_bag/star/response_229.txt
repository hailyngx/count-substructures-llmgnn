Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes have the following neighbors:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Node 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 each have at least 3 neighbors, so they are candidates for forming 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2.

Therefore, there are 2 3-stars in this graph. 
List of unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>

Putting the final count inside brackets: [2].
