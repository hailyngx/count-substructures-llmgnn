Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph. Let's analyze each node to find the number of 3-stars it belongs to:

1. Node 0: This node has neighbors {4, 6, 9}. Using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula, there are \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star centered at node 0. Thus, we have <0, (4, 6, 9)>.

2. Node 1: This node has neighbors {8, 9}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

3. Node 2: This node has neighbors {6, 8}. Since it has only 2 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

4. Node 3: This node has neighbors {5, 8, 9}. Using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula, there is 1 3-star centered at node 3. Thus, we have <3, (5, 8, 9)>.

5. Node 4: This node has neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}. Using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars centered at node 4. Thus, we have <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, and <4, (6, 7, 8)>.

6. Node 5: This node has neighbors {3, 8, 9}. Using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula, there is 1 3-star centered at node 5. Thus, we have <5, (3, 8, 9)>.

7. Node 6: This node has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 8}. Using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars centered at node 6. Thus, we have <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, and <6, (2, 4, 8)>.

8. Node 7: This node has only 1 neighbor, node 4, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

9. Node 8: This node has neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}. Using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula, there are \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\) 3-stars centered at node 8.

10. Node 9: This node has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}. Using the \(\binom{n}{3}\) formula, there are \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars centered at node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph, we get 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 10 = 56. Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [56].
