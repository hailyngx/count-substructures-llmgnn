Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
