Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms 1 3-star, <2, (0, 6, 8)>.

Adding them up, we get a total of [1].
