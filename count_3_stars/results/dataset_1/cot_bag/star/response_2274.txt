Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Starting with the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the mentioned rules:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors forming 1 3-star.

Summing up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \). So, there are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph, represented as follows:
\[ [6] \]
\[ <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 0, 6)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 0)> \]
