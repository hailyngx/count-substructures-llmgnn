Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To start, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 7, 9)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
