Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

- Node 0: 0 has 2 neighbors (2, 6), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 1: 1 has 1 neighbor (5), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 2: 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8). It can form 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, and inom{4}{3} = 4 other unique 3-stars. 
    
- Node 3: 3 has 1 neighbor (7), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 4: 4 has 2 neighbors (2, 9), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 5: 5 has 2 neighbors (1, 2), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 6: 6 has 1 neighbor (0), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 7: 7 has 1 neighbor (3), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 8: 8 has 2 neighbors (2, 9), so it doesn't form any 3-star.
    
- Node 9: 9 has 2 neighbors (4, 8), so it doesn't form any 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 2) + 4 (inom{4}{3} = 4) = 5. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (2, 4, 5)>.
