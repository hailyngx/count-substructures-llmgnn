Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and considering the given edges, the connections can be represented as follows:

(0) -> {1, 7}
(1) -> {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
(3) -> {5}
(4) -> {1, 9}
(5) -> {1, 3, 6, 9}
(6) -> {1, 5}
(7) -> {0}
(8) -> {9}
(9) -> {1, 4, 5, 8}

Now let's find the 3-stars:

Only node 1 has exactly 3 neighbors and can form one 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 9)>.

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \left[\binom{1}{3}\right] = [1] \]

So, there is 1 unique 3-star in this graph, which is <1, (4, 5, 9)>.
