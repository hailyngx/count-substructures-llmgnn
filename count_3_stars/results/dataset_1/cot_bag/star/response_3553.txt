Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 5, 8  
Node 1: 5, 7, 8  
Node 2: 4, 6  
Node 3: 7, 8  
Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9  
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9  
Node 6: 2, 9  
Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5  
Node 8: 0, 1, 3  
Node 9: 4, 5, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  

Summing these up, we get a total of 19 3-stars: [19].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:  
<1, (5, 7, 8)>  
<4, (2, 5, 7)>  
<4, (5, 7, 9)>  
<4, (7, 5, 9)>  
<4, (9, 5, 6)>  
<5, (0, 1, 7)>   
<5, (0, 7, 4)>   
<5, (1, 4, 7)>  
<5, (1, 7, 5)>  
<5, (4, 7, 9)>  
<7, (1, 3, 5)>  
<7, (1, 5, 7)>  
<7, (3, 5, 7)>  
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
