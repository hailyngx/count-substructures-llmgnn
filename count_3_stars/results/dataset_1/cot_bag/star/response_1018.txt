Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 4, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: nodes 4 and 8, so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 6, 8, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars for node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 6)>, <4, (6, 1, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 1)> and <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 6)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 8, 6)>, <8, (1, 8, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 1)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 8, 6)>.
