Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 3, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
