Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Edges: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: Neighbors {5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars = [3]

Unique 3-stars: <<2, 4, 8>>
