Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \([4 + 1] = 5\)

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
