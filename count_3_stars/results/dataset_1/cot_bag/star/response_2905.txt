Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's start by listing the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
