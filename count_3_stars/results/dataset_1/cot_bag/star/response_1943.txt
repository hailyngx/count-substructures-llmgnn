Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 1, 5, 8
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 6: 4, 9
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, thus no 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, thus no 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, thus no 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [30]

Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>
