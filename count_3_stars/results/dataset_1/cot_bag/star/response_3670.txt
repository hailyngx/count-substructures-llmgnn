Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 5, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
