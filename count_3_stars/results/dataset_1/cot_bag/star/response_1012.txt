Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 6)}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star as the center with nodes (2, 4, 5)
- Node 0 forms a 3-star as the center with nodes (7, 9)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star as the center with nodes (5, 6)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star as the center with nodes (1, 2, 8)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star as the center with nodes (2, 9)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 9)>
