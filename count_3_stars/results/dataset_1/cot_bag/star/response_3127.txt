Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 20 nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
6. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
8. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 20.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 5)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 0, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 1)>
<4, (8, 0, 1)>
<4, (8, 1, 0)>
<4, (8, 2, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 0)>
<5, (1, 9, 4)>
<5, (4, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
