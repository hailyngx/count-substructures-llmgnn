Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's list the nodes that each node is connected to:
- Node 0 is connected to: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 1 is connected to: {3, 4}
- Node 3 is connected to: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4 is connected to: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 5 is connected to: {3, 6}
- Node 6 is connected to: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 7 is connected to: {3, 8}
- Node 8 is connected to: {7}
- Node 9 is connected to: {4}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

[Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 1 = 12 \)]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>
