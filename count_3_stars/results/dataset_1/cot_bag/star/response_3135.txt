Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 7.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, and 9.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 7.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 8.

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, we can apply the combination formula to count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For the node with 4 neighbors (node 7), we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [7] \). 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 7, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
