Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes with more than two neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors 2, 4, 6, 7
Node 2 has neighbors 1, 5, 6, 8
Node 3 has neighbors 4, 6, 7
Node 4 has neighbors 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6 has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 8 has neighbors 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 9 has neighbors 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 3-star)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>
