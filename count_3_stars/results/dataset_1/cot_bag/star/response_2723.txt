Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to see which nodes it is connected to.  

Node 0 is connected to 5 other nodes: 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. This means it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars, and they are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>

Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 3, 4, and 6. It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, and they are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>

Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 1, 4, and 6. It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars, and they are:
<3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>

Node 4 is connected to 6 other nodes: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8. It can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars, and they are:
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 5)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (6, 5, 8)>

Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 4, 6, and 8. It can form 1 3-star, which is:
<5, (4, 6, 8)>

Node 6 is connected to 6 other nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. It can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars, and they are:
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>

Node 7 is connected to only 1 node: 6. Hence, it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes: 4 and 5. Hence, it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes: 0 and 6. Hence, it cannot form any 3-star.

Since only nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6 can form 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 39. 
Therefore, the final answer is [39].
