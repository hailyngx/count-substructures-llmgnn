Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

We can see that nodes 1 and 5 have 6 and 4 neighbors respectively, making them eligible to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  - These 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - These 3-stars are: <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 = 24, so the final answer is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>.
