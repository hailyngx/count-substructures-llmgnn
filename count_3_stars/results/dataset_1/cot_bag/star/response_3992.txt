Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
We will determine the 3-star configurations in the given graph.
  
Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 4)>.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 5)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 7)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <7, (2, 6, 8)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.


So, in total, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which gives the final answer as [6].
