Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with 3, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 3-stars with Node 0.
- Node 1 forms no 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms no 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms no 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with Node 4.
- Node 5 forms no 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms no 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with Node 8.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 3, 5, 6>
<4, 4, 8, 9>
<8, 8, 9, 9> 

So, the final representation is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, 3, 5, 6>, <4, 4, 8, 9>, and <8, 8, 9, 9>.
