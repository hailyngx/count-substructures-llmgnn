Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
  - <0, (5, 9, 2)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (0, 1, 2)>
  - <5, (0, 1, 6)>
  - <5, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <5, (0, 2, 9)>
  - <5, (0, 6, 1)>
  - <5, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <5, (0, 7, 6)>
  - <5, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 8, 6)>
  - <5, (2, 0, 9)>
  - <5, (2, 9, 0)>
  - <5, (6, 0, 7)>
  - <5, (6, 1, 7)>
  - <5, (6, 7, 0)>
  - <5, (6, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (7, 0, 6)>
  - <5, (7, 6, 0)>
  - <5, (7, 6, 8)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 7, 5)>
  - <6, (5, 0, 7)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 0)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <7, (3, 9, 5)>
  - <7, (5, 0, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 6, 0)>

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 9, 2)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 0, 9)>
- <5, (6, 0, 7)>
- <5, (7, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 0, 6)>
