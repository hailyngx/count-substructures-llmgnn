Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with each of their neighbors:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 5)>, <1, (7, 6, 5)>, <2, (4, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>.
