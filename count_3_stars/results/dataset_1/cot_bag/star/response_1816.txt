Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
  - {0, 8}
  - {2, 4}, {2, 7}, {2, 8}, {2, 9}
  - {3, 5}
  - {4, 2}, {4, 6}, {4, 7}, {4, 9}
  - {5, 3}, {5, 8}
  - {6, 4}, {6, 8}
  - {7, 2}, {7, 4}
  - {8, 0}, {8, 2}, {8, 5}, {8, 6}, {8, 9}
  - {9, 2}, {9, 4}, {9, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 2: neighbors {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 4, 8}

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 19 3-stars. Hence, the final result is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (8, 9, 4)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 9, 5)>
- <8, (0, 9, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (9, 2, 5)>
- <8, (9, 2, 6)>
- <8, (9, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 2, 8)>
