Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 5, 6
Node 1: 2, 6, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 3: 0, 9
Node 4: 2, 7
Node 5: 0, 2
Node 6: 0, 1, 8
Node 7: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 8: 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [1]
<0, (3, 5, 6)>

Node 1: [1]
<1, (2, 6, 9)>

Node 2: [3]
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>

Node 3: [0]

Node 4: [0]

Node 5: [0]

Node 6: [1]
<6, (0, 1, 8)>

Node 7: [3]
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 9, 8)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>

Node 8: [1]
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 9: [3]
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3] = [13].
