Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
    1---3---9---6
   /|  / \     | 
  0 | /   4    7
   \|/    |   /|
    8     |  / |
          2 5  |
              |
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with 3, 4, and 7: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 1 forms 3-stars with 3, 4, and 0: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>
Node 4 forms 3-stars with 1, 7, and 0: <4, (1, 0, 3)>, <4, (1, 7, 0)>
Node 7 forms 3-stars with 4, 0, and 9: <7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 9, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
