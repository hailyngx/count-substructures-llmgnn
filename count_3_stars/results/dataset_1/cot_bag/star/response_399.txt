Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Let's now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<1, (0, 7, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 1)>
<1, (0, 6, 1)>
<1, (0, 7, 1)>
<1, (0, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 1)>

There are 23 unique 3-stars identified, so the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
