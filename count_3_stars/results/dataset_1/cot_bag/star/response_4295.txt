Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
Since node 0 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 9), there is 1 3-star formed with node 0 as the center: <0, (6, 7, 9)>.

For node 2: 
Since node 2 has 2 neighbors (3, 5), it does not form any 3-stars.

For node 3: 
Since node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9), there is 1 3-star formed with node 3 as the center: <3, (2, 7, 9)>.

For node 5: 
Since node 5 has 2 neighbors (2, 8), it does not form any 3-stars.

For node 6: 
Since node 6 has 2 neighbors (0, 9), it does not form any 3-stars.

For node 7: 
Since node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9), there are 4 3-stars formed with node 7 as the center: 
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 4)>.

For node 9: 
Since node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7, 8), there are 10 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center: 
<9, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (6, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 9) = 16.
Putting this value inside brackets, we get the answer: [16].
