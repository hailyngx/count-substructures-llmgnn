Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4] = 33 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 1, 5)>, <2, (8, 5, 6)>, <2, (8, 5, 7)>, <2, (8, 6, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>
