Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
0: 3, 7  
1: 7, 8  
2: 9  
3: 0, 4, 6, 8  
4: 3, 7  
5: 6, 7, 8  
6: 3, 5, 9  
7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8  
8: 1, 3, 5, 7  
9: 2, 6  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

Node 1 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

Node 2 forms inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars.

Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 5)>, <3, (6, 5, 8)>.

Node 4 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 8)>.

Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <6, (3, 5, 9)>.

Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 0)>, <7, (3, 6, 5)>, <7, (5, 8, 1)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>.

Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>.

Node 9 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 20.
