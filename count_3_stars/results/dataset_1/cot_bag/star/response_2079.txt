Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
0: 5, 6, 9
1: 3, 4, 6, 8
2: 3, 6, 9
3: 1, 2, 8
4: 1, 5, 8
5: 0, 4, 8, 9
6: 0, 1, 2, 7
7: 6
8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
9: 0, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 3: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
Node 8: C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (8, 9, 5)>
