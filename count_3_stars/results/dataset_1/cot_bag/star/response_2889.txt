Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 4, 6, 7 (degree 4)
- Node 1: neighbors 0, 3, 5 (degree 3)
- Node 2: neighbors 5, 8, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 4, 7, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 4: neighbors 0, 3, 5, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 (degree 5)
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 5, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 7: neighbors 0, 3, 5, 6, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 3 (degree 2)
- Node 9: neighbors 2, 4, 7 (degree 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree at least 3:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32

So, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
