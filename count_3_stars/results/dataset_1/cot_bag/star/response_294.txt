Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- For node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- For node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- For node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- For node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- For node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].
