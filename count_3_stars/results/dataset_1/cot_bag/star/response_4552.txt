Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 24 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 5)>

<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
