Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges visually:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Edges:
- 1 is connected to 3, 6
- 2 is connected to 5, 6, 7
- 3 is connected to 1, 4, 9
- 4 is connected to 3, 5, 8
- 5 is connected to 2, 4, 6, 8
- 6 is connected to 1, 2, 5
- 7 is connected to 2
- 8 is connected to 4, 5
- 9 is connected to 3

Next, let's identify the nodes that can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors
- Node 7: has 1 neighbor
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[2, 1, 6]>, <[3, 1, 6]>, <[4, 3, 5]>, <[4, 3, 8]>, <[4, 5, 8]>, <[5, 2, 6]>, <[5, 4, 6]>, <[5, 4, 8]>.
