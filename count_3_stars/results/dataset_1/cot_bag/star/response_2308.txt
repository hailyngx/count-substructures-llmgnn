Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 8: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 3-stars
For node 9: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 39 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
