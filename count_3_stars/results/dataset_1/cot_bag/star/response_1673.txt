Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <1, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (6, 4, 8)>
  - <1, (7, 0, 2)>
  - <1, (8, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <7, (0, 1, 2)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
