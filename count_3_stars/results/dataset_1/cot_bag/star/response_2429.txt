Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10] = [11].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
