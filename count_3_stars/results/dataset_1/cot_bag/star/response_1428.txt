Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

The graph has the following nodes and neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbor {8}
- Node 7: Neighbor {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 13

So, [13] unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (8, 6, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 1)>, <3, (8, 9, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, and <9, (1, 3, 8)>.
