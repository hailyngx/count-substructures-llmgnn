Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
