Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 1

Nodes 0, 5, and 7 have degrees greater than or equal to 3, so they are potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1+4+4] = [9] \).

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
