Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 has neighbors 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 5, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 5
- Node 3 has neighbors 4, 6
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 3
- Node 7 has neighbor 0
- Node 8 has neighbor 1
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 5

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 4 = 15\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 3)>
<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<0, (4, 5, 0)>
<0, (4, 5, 2)>
<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<0, (5, 2, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 0)>

These unique 3-stars are listed inside <> each only once.
