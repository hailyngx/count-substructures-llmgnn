Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we need to determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph. Let's first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 4, 5
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 8
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <3, (2, 7, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 0, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <7, (3, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>

After calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node and considering nodes with 3 or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 0, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
