Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 3 and Node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 0, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 2, Node 3, and Node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 2 and Node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 2, Node 5, and Node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 1.

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors and count the 3-stars:

- Node 2: 4 neighbors -> [1] 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors -> [1] 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> [1] 1 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors -> [1] 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
