Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 8, 5
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula discussed earlier:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all of these together, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 33 \) 3-stars [].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <1, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
3. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
8. <6, (1, 7, 9)>
9. <7, (3, 4, 6)>
