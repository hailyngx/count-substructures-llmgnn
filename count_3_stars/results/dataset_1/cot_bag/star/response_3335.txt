Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to consider nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's examine the degrees of each node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14. 

Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (3, 1, 7)>
<2, (9, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
