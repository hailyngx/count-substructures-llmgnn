Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 40 

Therefore, the final answer is [40]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>

<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
