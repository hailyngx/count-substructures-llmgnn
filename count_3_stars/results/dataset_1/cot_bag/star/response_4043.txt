Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
In this graph, we have the following nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: In total, we have 4 neighbors. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with Node 0.

For Node 3: We also have 3 neighbors. Hence, there is 1 3-star formed with Node 3.

For Node 4: Again, 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed with Node 4.

For Node 6: 4 neighbors, creating \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 0)>
