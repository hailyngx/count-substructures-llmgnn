Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 72 \)

So, the final answer is [72].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 9, 9)>, <7, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>
