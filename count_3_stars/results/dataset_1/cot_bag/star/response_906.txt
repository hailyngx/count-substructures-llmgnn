Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 8: \(\binom{8}{3}\) = 56 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 56 = 88

Therefore, there are a total of [88] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
