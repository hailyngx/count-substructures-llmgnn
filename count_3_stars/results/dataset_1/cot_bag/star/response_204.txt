Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 7)]

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, and 8: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 7, and 8: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
