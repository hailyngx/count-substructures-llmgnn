Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4) - Degree 2
Node 2: (2, 8) - Degree 1
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7) - Degree 3
Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8) - Degree 3
Node 6: (6, 9) - Degree 1
Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 9) - Degree 2
Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 9) - Degree 3
Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) - Degree 3

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, there are 4 total 3-stars in this graph.
Listing the unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)> 

Putting the final answer in brackets:
\[ [4] \]
