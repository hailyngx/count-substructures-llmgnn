Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 7
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9
Node 9: 3, 8

Now, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 6

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node, therefore, 6 3-stars
For the node with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Adding these together gives a total of 16 3-stars.

So, the final result is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
