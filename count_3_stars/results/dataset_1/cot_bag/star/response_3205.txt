Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: neighbors = {6}
- Node 2: neighbors = {3, 5}
- Node 3: neighbors = {2, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors = {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors = {2}
- Node 6: neighbors = {1}
- Node 7: neighbors = {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors = {4}
- Node 9: neighbors = {4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Thus, we can form 3-stars from nodes 4 and 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 4: inom{3}{2} = 3 3-stars can be formed
- For node 7: inom{3}{2} = 3 3-stars can be formed

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 3] = [6].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 3, 9)>
- <7, (9, 4, 8)>
- <7, (9, 4, 3)>
- <7, (4, 3, 9)>
- <7, (4, 9, 3)>
