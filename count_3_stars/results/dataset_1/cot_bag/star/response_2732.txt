Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 8, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars from all nodes gives us a total of 23 3-stars. So, the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>.
