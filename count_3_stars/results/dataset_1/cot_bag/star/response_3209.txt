Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 2)

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 2: 3 3-stars <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>
Node 3: 3 3-stars <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 0 3-stars
Node 7: 0 3-stars
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: 0 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 9 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
