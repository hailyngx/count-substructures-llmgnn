Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25 \)

So, there are 25 3-stars in this graph.

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>,
<2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>,
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>,
<5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>,
<6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>,
<7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>,
<9, (3, 4, 8)>.
