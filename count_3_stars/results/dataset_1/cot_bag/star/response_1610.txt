Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0  (0 3-stars)
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1  (1 unique 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 8)>)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1  (1 unique 3-star: <2, (6, 8, 9)>)
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1  (1 unique 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 9)>)
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4  (4 unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>)

Total number of 3-stars: 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>.
