Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's go through each node and determine the number of 3-stars involving that node:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 1
Node 3: Degree 2
Node 4: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 2
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 5
Node 8: Degree 2
Node 9: Degree 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars is the sum of the above numbers: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (2, 0, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 0)>
<7, (5, 0, 2)>
<7, (5, 2, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 4)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (7, 3, 4)>
<9, (7, 4, 1)>
