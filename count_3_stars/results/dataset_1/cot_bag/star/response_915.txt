Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by considering each node with three or more neighbors. There are a few such nodes in this graph.

For node 0 (which has 6 neighbors), there are \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) possible 3-stars. Listing them out:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>.

For node 2 (which also has 6 neighbors), there are \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) possible 3-stars. But note that some of these 3-stars are already counted under node 0, so we need to exclude those duplicates. Listing the unique ones:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>.

For node 3 (which has 3 neighbors), there is only 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 8)>.

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 5 + 1 = 26 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [26].
