Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
