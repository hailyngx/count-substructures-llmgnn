Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 1), (3, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5), (9, 4)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 8)
Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 8)
Node 2: (2, 1)
Node 3: (3, 5)
Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9)
Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8)
Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8)
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7)
Node 9: (9, 4)

Applying the combinatorial calculation to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8, which have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 3-stars)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 7, 8)>
