Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors. For each such node, we will compute the number of 3-stars formed with that node as the center.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 0 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
Node 2 contributes 1 3-star.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
Node 4 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8
Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 \).
Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4, 5>
<0, 2, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 6, 8>
<2, 0, 3, 8>
<5, 0, 4, 8>
<5, 4, 6, 8>
<6, 0, 4, 8>
<6, 4, 6, 8>
<6, 4, 5, 8>
<6, 5, 8, 9>
