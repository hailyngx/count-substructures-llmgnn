Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
