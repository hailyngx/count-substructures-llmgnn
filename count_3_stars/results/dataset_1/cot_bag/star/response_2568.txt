Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 4: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 5: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 6: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 7: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 8: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 9: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star

Therefore, in total [1] 3-star can be formed in this graph, which is <2, (3, 4, 5)>.
