Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7. So, only 1 3-star can be formed with node 3 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9. So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9. So, only 1 3-star can be formed with node 7 as the center.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6. So, only 1 3-star can be formed with node 8 as the center.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 7. As it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with node 9 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>.
