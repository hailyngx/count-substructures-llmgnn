Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph visually to easier identify the 3-star structures:

```plaintext
      1 --- 6 --- 2
     /      |     \
    0 --- 5-9-4 --- 3
     \      |     /
      7     8 ---
```

Now, let's categorize the nodes based on their degree:

- Degree-2 Nodes: 7, 8
- Degree-3 Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Degree-4 Nodes: 5, 6, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each degree-3 or higher node:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 0 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [9] 3-stars. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (6, 9, 4)>
- <4, (7, 9, 5)>
- <5, (0, 9, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (6, 5, 4)>
- <9, (6, 2, 5)>
- <9, (6, 4, 5)>
- <9, (6, 5, 3)>
