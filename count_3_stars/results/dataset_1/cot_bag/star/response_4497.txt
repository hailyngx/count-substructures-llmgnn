Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 5, 9
Node 2: 1, 6
Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 8
Node 4: 0, 3
Node 5: 1, 3, 9
Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9
Node 7: 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 3, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6

We can see that nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Inside brackets []: [22]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
