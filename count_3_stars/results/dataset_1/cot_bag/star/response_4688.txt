Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify which nodes have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [3]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [0]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [7]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (5, 0, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>
