Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To start, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 4, 5)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 4)>
<9, (1, 6, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 5)>
<9, (2, 7, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (7, 6, 9)> 

These are the unique 3-stars present in the graph.
