Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

The 3-stars in this graph are:

[6]
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<1, (8, 7, 4)>
<2, (7, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 6, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
