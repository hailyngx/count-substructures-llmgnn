Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {2, 8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 8}

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: [C(3, 3) + C(3, 3) + C(6, 3)] = [1 + 1 + 20] = 22
- For Node 2: [C(2, 3) + C(6, 3)] = [0 + 20] = 20
- For Node 3: [C(2, 3) + C(6, 3)] = [0 + 20] = 20
- For Node 4: [C(2, 3) + C(6, 3)] = [0 + 20] = 20
- For Node 8: [C(6, 3) + C(6, 3)] = [20 + 20] = 40
- For Node 9: [C(2, 3) + C(6, 3)] = [0 + 20] = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 40 + 20] = [142].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (6, 8, 0)>
- <3, (0, 8, 2)>
- <4, (9, 8, 0)>
- <8, (1, 9, 0)>
- <8, (2, 6, 0)>
- <8, (3, 0, 2)>
- <8, (6, 2, 0)>
- <8, (9, 4, 0)>
- <9, (8, 4, 0)>
