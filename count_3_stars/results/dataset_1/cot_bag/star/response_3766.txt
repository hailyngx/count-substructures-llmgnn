Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

The graph has 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}.
The edges are: (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 1).

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 8}.
Node 4 has neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 8}.
Node 5 has neighbors: {2, 3, 4}.
Node 1 has neighbors: {4, 7, 9}.
Node 7 has neighbors: {1, 2, 8}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

So, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 1, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 8)>.
