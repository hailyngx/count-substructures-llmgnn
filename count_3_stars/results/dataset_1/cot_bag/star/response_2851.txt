Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 5, 6} -> can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 9} -> can form 1 3-star
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7} -> can form comb(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7} -> can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7} -> can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6} -> can form 1 3-star

So, there are a total of [1+1+10+1+1+1] = 15 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>
