Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 2, 5, and 7.

For node 2:
- There are 4 possible 3-star combinations with node 2: <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>.

For node 5:
- There are 2 possible 3-star combinations with node 5: <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>.

For node 7:
- There is 1 possible 3-star combination with node 7: <7, (2, 3, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 2 + 1] = 7. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, and <7, (2, 3, 8)>.
