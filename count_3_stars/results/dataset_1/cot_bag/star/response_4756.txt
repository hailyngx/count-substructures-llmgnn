Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's determine the 3-stars from each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 [\[inom{5}{3}\] = 10]
  <0, (1, 2, 3)>
  <0, (1, 3, 6)>
  <0, (1, 3, 9)>
  <0, (2, 3, 6)>
  <0, (2, 3, 9)>
  <0, (1, 6, 9)>
  <0, (2, 6, 9)>
  <0, (3, 6, 9)>
  <0, (1, 2, 6)>
  <0, (1, 2, 9)>

- Node 1: 0, 3, 8 [\[inom{3}{3}\] = 1]
  <1, (0, 3, 8)>

- Node 3: 0, 1 [\[inom{2}{3}\] = 0]

- Node 4: 6, 7, 9 [\[inom{3}{3}\] = 1]
  <4, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: 7, 8 [\[inom{2}{3}\] = 0]

- Node 6: 0, 4 [\[inom{2}{3}\] = 0]

- Node 7: 4, 5 [\[inom{2}{3}\] = 0]

- Node 8: 1, 5 [\[inom{2}{3}\] = 0]

- Node 9: 0, 4 [\[inom{2}{3}\] = 0]

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 12 3-stars. So, the final answer is [12].
