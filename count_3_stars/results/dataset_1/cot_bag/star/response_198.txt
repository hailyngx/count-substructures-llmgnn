Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 4 + 4 = 28 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 1)>
- <0, (4, 6, 1)>
- <0, (6, 4, 1)>
- <0, (7, 8, 1)>
- <0, (8, 7, 1)>
- <0, (8, 7, 2)>
- <0, (8, 7, 5)>
- <0, (8, 3, 1)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 0, 6)>
- <1, (7, 2, 0)>
- <4, (0, 6, 1)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 3)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [28].
