Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 34 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>
