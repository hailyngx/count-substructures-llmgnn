Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 8. 

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, node 3 has 4 neighbors, and node 8 has 4 neighbors.

For node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Adding these up:
\[ [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 2, 8)>, <0, (4, 2, 8)>, <0, (6, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (8, 0, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>
