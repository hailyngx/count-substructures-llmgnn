Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5). Therefore, there are [ inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 9). Therefore, there are [ inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9). Therefore, there are [ inom{5}{3} ] = 10 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5). Therefore, there are [ inom{3}{3} ] = 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 1), (9, 2). Therefore, there are [ inom{2}{3} ] = 0 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 16.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 1)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>.
