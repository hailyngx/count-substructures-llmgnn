Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors 1, 4, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 1: neighbors 0, 2, 5, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 2: neighbors 1, 5, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (degree 6)

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>

- <5, (5, 2, 8)>
- <5, (5, 8, 2)>
