Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first construct the graph based on the given edges. 

The graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8)]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 7)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: (0, 4)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 2, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (4, 5, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <0, (1, 4, 7)>

- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>

- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6. 

So, the final answer is [6].
