Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
  ```
      0 -- 4    1 -- 2       3
      |    |    |     \     / \
      6    |    3       1   7   8
           |   /|\       \ /
           7  0 | \       4
          /  /  |  7   __|
         9  1   2 -- 4
            |  /
            6 /
             5
  ```
Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 contributes inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1 contributes inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 contributes inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 contributes inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 contributes inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 contributes inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 34

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
