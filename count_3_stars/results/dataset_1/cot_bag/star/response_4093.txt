Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 3-stars
- Node 4: 12 3-stars
- Node 5: 6 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 2 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [31]

Unique 3-stars found in this graph: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 0, 1)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 2, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 2)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 4)>, <7, (1, 6, 5)>, <8, (1, 6, 4)>
