Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: has 4 neighbors
Node 1: has 3 neighbors
Node 2: has 5 neighbors
Node 3: has 3 neighbors
Node 6: has 4 neighbors
Node 8: has 3 neighbors
Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Now, applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
