Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
For node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up gives a total of 44 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
