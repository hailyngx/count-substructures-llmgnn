Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6
Based on the given edges, we identified the neighboring nodes for each node above. Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 20 + 10 = 50 \), which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>
