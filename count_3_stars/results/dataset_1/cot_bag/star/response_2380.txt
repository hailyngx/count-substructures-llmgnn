Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms  inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Add them up to find the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 = 6]. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6.
