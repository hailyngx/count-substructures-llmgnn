Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Given the number of nodes and edges, we can construct the graph.  

The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 9
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 2
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 1
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 7

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars by considering each node that has 3 or more neighbors.
Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each such node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [84 + 4 + 4 + 35] = [127] \)

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
