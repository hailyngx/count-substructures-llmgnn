Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will iterate through each node and identify if the node forms a 3-star using the described method. 

For each node:
- Node 0 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors and they do not form a 3-star configuration.
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors and they do not form a 3-star configuration.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has 3 neighbors and they do not form a 3-star configuration.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has 3 neighbors and they do not form a 3-star configuration.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Counting up the total number of 3-stars gives 3. Therefore, the answer is [3]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, and <9, (0, 3, 5)>.
