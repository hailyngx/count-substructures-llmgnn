Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 5, and 9.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 7)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [16].
