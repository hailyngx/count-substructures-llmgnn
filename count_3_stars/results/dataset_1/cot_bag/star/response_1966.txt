Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9.

Let's calculate the 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars

Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 52

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 8, 1)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
