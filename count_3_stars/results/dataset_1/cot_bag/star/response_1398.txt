Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
