Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are as described. Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors: \( \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8 \)
So, there are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. The final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 5)>
