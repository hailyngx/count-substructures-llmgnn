Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7

Using the combinatorial formula, we check nodes with 3 or more neighbors for 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 3-stars: <7, (0, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 7
Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [7].
