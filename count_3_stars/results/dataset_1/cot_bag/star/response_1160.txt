Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph for better understanding:
```
    0 -- 2       3 -- 4       5 -- 6       7 -- 8
    |    |       |    |       |    |       |    |
    6    |       |    |       |    |       |    |
         1       4    |       9    |       8    |
                      |             |             |
                      5             7             9
```

Based on the provided information, we can see that node 0 has 2 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, node 4 has 4 neighbors, node 5 has 3 neighbors, node 6 has 3 neighbors, node 7 has 2 neighbors, and node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each appropriate node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
