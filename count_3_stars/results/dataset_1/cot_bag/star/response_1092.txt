Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>
