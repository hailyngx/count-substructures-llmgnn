Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the total number of 3-stars formed, let's first list out the degree of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 1
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 1
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 2
Node 7: degree 1
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1

From the degrees listed above, we observe that nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5 have 3 or more neighbors, meaning they have the potential to form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of 7 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer to the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 2, 6, 8>
- <2, 0, 4, 9>
- <4, 2, 5, 6>
- <5, 1, 2, 6>
- <5, 2, 6, 8>
- <5, 2, 6, 7>
- <5, 4, 9, 2>
