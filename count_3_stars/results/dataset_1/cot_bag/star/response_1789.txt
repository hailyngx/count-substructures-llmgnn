Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 6, and 7.

For node 0:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- The 3-stars involving node 0 are: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 4)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- The 3-stars involving node 6 are: <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 5)>, <6, (7, 5, 8)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- The 3-stars involving node 7 are: <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 4)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4] = [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 4)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 5)>, <6, (7, 5, 8)>,
<7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 4)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>.
