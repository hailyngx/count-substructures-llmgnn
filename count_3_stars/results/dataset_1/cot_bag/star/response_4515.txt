Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {4, 8}
- 1: {6, 7}
- 2: {5, 6}
- 3: {4}
- 4: {0, 3}
- 5: {2, 6, 8}
- 6: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- 7: {1}
- 8: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- 9: {6, 8}

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 = 15

Thus, the final count of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, 2, 8>
- <6, 1, 9>
- <6, 2, 5>
- <6, 2, 8>
- <6, 2, 9>
- <6, 5, 8>
- <6, 5, 9>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <8, 0, 9>
- <8, 5, 6>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <9, 6, 8>
