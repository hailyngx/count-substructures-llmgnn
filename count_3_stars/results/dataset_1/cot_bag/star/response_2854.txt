Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges:

Nodes: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 1), (8, 6), (9, 4)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 7.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 9.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars: [inom{3}{3} + inom{5}{3} = 1 + 10 = 11]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 11. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>
