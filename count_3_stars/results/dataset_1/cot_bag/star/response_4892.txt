Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: Node 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8, so it can form 3-stars with any three of these neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: Node 0, 2, 5, and 6, so it can form 3-stars with any three of these neighbors.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: Node 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9, so it can form 3-stars with any three of these neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: Node 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, so it can form 3-stars with any three of these neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34 \).
So, the total number of 3-stars is [34].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
