Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 1)>
