Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6: <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 7: <7, (2, 8, 7)>

Putting it all together, we have a total of [3] 3-stars: 
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, and <7, (2, 8, 7)>.
