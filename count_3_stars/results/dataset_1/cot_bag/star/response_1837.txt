Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as pairs of nodes.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11.

So, the answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (6, 0, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 1, 4)>
- <9, (2, 1, 8)>
