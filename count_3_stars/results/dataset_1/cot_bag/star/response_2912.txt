Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 2, 3)>
- <1, (5, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 0, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
