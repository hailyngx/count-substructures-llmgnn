Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we will draw the graph based on the provided edges to visualize it and identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

The graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6.

Nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars for each of the identified nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 27

So, the final answer is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 0, 9)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (6, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 0, 5)>
<4, (2, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 0, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 0, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
