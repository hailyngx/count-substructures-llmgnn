Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Edges: {(0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 3)}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 0: Only 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
Node 1: 3 neighbors - forms 1 3-star.
Node 2: 4 neighbors - forms 4 3-stars.
Node 3: 5 neighbors - forms 10 3-stars.
Node 5: 4 neighbors - forms 4 3-stars.
Node 6: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
Node 7: 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star.
Node 8: 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

So, there are 19 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [19]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 1, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 1)>, <2, (3, 5, 0)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 1, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 1)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 0, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 0)>, <5, (3, 0, 2)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (3, 1, 0)>, <2, (3, 0, 1)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>
