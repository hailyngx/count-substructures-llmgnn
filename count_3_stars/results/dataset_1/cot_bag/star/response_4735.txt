Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7)
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 8, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6)
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5)
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]

- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (3, 7)
  - Number of 3-stars: [0]

- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (0, 6)
  - Number of 3-stars: [0]

- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (1)
  - Number of 3-stars: [0]

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5)
  - Number of 3-stars: [1]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
