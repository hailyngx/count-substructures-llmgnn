Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
