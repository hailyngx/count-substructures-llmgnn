Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 6.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 6.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 45.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].
