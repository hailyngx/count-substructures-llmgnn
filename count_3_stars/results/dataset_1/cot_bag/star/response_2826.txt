Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 7). There are 4 other 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
3. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
4. <0, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7). There are 4 other 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
5. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
6. <2, (0, 3, 7)>
7. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
8. <2, (3, 4, 7)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8). There are 4 other 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
9. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
10. <4, (2, 7, 8)>
11. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
12. <4, (2, 6, 8)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 8). There are 4 other 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
13. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
14. <7, (0, 4, 8)>
15. <7, (2, 4, 8)>
16. <11, (0, 2, 8)>

Node 8 has 2 neighbors (4, 7). As it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with node 8 as the center.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
