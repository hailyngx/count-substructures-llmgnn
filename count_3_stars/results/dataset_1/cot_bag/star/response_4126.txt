Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we get a total of [1 + 1 + 4 = 6] 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Thus, the final answer is [6].
