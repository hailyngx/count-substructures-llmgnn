Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
