Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 9)
(1, 0), (1, 3)
(2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9)
(3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9)
(4, 2)
(5, 7), (5, 8)
(6, 3)
(7, 3), (7, 5)
(8, 2), (8, 5)
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3)

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
