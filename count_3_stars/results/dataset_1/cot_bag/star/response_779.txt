Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:
  
[9]

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 0, 3)>
<2, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (7, 0, 8)>
<4, (9, 5, 8)>
<5, (8, 9, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (3, 1, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
