Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 19.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 3, 9)>
