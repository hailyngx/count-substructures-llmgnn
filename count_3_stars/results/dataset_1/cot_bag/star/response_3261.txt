Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
We start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
