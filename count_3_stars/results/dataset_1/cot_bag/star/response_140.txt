Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 9)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (node 6)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 6)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 6)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (node 2)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (node 2)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 1)

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 26 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
