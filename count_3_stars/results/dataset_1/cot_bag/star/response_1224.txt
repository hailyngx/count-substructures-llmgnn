Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 0), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 9), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them.

Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (3, 1), (5, 1) -> 1 3-star (1, 3, 5)

Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8), (7, 3), (8, 3) -> 1 3-star (3, 1, 7), 1 3-star (3, 1, 8)

Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 7), (6, 4), (7, 4) -> No 3-star

Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 9), (9, 5) -> No 3-star

Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (9, 7) -> 1 3-star (7, 3, 9)

Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8), (5, 9) (7, 9), (8, 9) -> 1 3-star (9, 5, 7), 1 3-star (9, 5, 8), 1 3-star (9, 7, 8)

Total number of 3-stars: [ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6]

Unique 3-stars: <1, 3, 5>, <3, 1, 7>, <3, 1, 8>, <7, 3, 9>, <9, 5, 7>, <9, 5, 8>
