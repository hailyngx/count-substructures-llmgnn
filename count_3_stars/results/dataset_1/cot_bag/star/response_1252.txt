Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors of node 0, so there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the central node. 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 1:
There are 4 neighbors of node 1, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the central node.
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors of node 2, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the central node.
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 3:
There are 8 neighbors of node 3, so there are \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the central node.
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, and 48 more

For node 9:
There are 3 neighbors of node 9, so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the central node.
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 56 + 1] = 66.
