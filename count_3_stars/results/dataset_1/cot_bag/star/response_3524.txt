Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 27. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (7, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>.
