Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```

  1 --- 3 --- 5 --- 9
 /|\         /|\
0 | 4       8 | 2
 \|/         \|/
  6 --- 7 --- 2


```

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 10 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 20 + 1 = 115

Therefore, there are a total of [115] 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
