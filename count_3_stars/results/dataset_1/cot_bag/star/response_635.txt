Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center. 
- Node 2: It has 7 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9). So, there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 8). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. 
- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6 as the center. 
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center. 
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 9). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center. 
- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 9 as the center. 
 
Adding up all the 3-stars from each center node, we get a total of 1 + 35 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 50 3-stars.
 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 0, 2)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>
