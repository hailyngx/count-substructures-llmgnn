Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's first visualize the graph by listing the nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: 3
Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 2: 1, 8
Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7
Node 4: 1, 3, 8
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 6, 7, 8

Now, counting the number of 3-stars around each node:

Node 1 forms 3-stars with (4, 6, 9), (2, 6, 9), and (4, 2, 8). Thus, 3 possible 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 3-stars with (4, 5, 7) and (6, 7, 9). Thus, 2 possible 3-stars.
Node 6 forms 3-stars with (7, 8, 9). Thus, 1 possible 3-star.
Node 9 forms 3-stars with (7, 8, 6). Thus, 1 possible 3-star.

Adding these up: [3 + 2 + 1 + 1] = [7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, and these 3-stars are:

<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>
