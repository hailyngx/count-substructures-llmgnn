Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9.

For node 0:
  - Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
  - Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors: 
    - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 1, 5)>
    - <0, (4, 1, 8)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (5, 1, 4)>
    - <0, (5, 4, 6)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (8, 1, 4)>
    - <0, (8, 1, 6)>

For node 1:
  - Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
  - Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors:
    - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 0, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 6)>
    - <1, (5, 0, 9)>
    - <1, (7, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (7, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (8, 0, 6)>
    - <1, (8, 6, 7)>

For node 4:
  - Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
  - Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors:
    - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 7, 6)>
    - <4, (1, 0, 6)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 6)>
    - <4, (7, 0, 6)>
    - <4, (7, 1, 6)>
    - <4, (7, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (7, 6, 9)>
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (8, 6, 9)>

For node 6:
  - Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
  - Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors:
    - <6, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <6, (4, 0, 6)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 6)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (7, 0, 6)>
    - <6, (7, 1, 6)>
    - <6, (7, 4, 8)>
    - <6, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
  - Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 6)>
  - Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors:
    - <9, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <9, (0, 1, 9)>
    - <9, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <9, (1, 0, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <9, (5, 0, 6)>
    - <9, (5, 1, 6)>
    - <9, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <9, (8, 1, 6)>
    - <9, (8, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 55.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].
