Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: It has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 3: It has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 4: It has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 20] = [34] \). The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
