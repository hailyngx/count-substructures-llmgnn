Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 2
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 6 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
