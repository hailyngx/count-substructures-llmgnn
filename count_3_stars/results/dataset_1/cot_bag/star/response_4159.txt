Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors.  
Node 0 has 5 neighbors.   
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 3 has 6 neighbors.  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.  

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes: 
1. For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
3. For the rest of the nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each  
This gives us a total of 10 + 20 + 4 = 34 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 7, 8)>  
<3, (0, 2, 5)>  
<3, (0, 7, 8)>  
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
