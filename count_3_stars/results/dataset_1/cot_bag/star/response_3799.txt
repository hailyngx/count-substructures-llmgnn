Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
Node 0: 5, 6
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 6, 8
Node 3: 7, 8
Node 4: 5, 6, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 6: 0, 2, 4
Node 7: 3, 5
Node 8: 2, 3, 4

We can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, which means they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up: 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

So, there are a total of 6 3-stars in this graph.

List of unique 3-stars: 
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
