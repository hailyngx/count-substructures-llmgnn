Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 39 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
