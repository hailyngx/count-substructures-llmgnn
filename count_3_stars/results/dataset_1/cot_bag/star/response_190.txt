Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 6

Now we'll identify the 3-stars based on the information provided:
- Node 1, 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 2, 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 3, 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 6, 3-stars: <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.
