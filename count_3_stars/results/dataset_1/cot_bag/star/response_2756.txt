Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 3

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{1} + \binom{3}{1} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{1}{1} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
