Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using these nodes:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1 has 3 neighbors - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 2 has 4 neighbors - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 3 has 4 neighbors - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 5 neighbors - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 6 has 3 neighbors - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 21
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 9, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
