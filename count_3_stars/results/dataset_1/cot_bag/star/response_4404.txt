Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph representation:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 7), (6, 2), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (8, 1)]

Now, let's determine the 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 7), (1, 2, 8), (1, 3, 7) = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 4), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 7), (1, 2, 7) = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 7), (2, 7, 5), (1, 7, 5), (1, 7, 2) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed

Adding up the 3-stars from each eligible node:
4 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 7) = 12

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <1, 2, 3>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 5>, <1, 7, 5>.
