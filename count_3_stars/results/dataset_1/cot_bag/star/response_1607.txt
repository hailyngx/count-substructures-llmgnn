Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 0

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
