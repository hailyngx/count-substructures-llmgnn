Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 3: 
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 9: 
    Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 10 + 10 = 40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
