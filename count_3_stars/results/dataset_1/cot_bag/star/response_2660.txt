Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 3-stars.

So, the answer is [32]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 1)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (8, 0, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
