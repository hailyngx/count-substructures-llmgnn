Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors. From the given edges, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node as the center.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, there are a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>.
