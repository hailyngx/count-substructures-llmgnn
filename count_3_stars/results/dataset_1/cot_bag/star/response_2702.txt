Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0,3), (0,6), (0,7), (2,6), (2,9), (3,0), (3,7), (3,9), (4,5), (4,8), (5,4), (5,7), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,3), (7,5), (7,9), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 6, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors: 6, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 4, 7
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>.
