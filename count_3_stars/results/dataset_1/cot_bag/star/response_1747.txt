Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0,1), (0,2), (0,5), (0,6), (1,0), (1,2), (1,6), (2,0), (2,1), (2,4), (3,8), (3,9), (4,2), (4,5), (4,9), (5,0), (5,4), (6,0), (6,1), (6,9), (7,8), (8,3), (8,7), (9,3), (9,4), (9,6)

Now, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
