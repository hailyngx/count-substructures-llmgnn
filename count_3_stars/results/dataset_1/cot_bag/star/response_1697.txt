Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 9
Node 1: 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 8
Node 4: 2, 5, 8
Node 5: 4, 8
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 10 + 1 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 3, 9)>  
<2, (0, 3, 4)>  
<2, (0, 3, 8)>  
<2, (0, 4, 8)>  
<2, (3, 4, 8)>  
<2, (3, 7, 8)>  
<2, (3, 8, 9)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (0, 2, 7)>  
<3, (2, 7, 8)>  
<3, (2, 8, 9)>  
<4, (2, 8, 9)>  
<7, (2, 8, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 7)>  
<8, (2, 3, 9)>  
<8, (2, 4, 9)>  
<8, (2, 5, 9)>  
<8, (3, 7, 9)>  
<8, (4, 5, 8)>  
<8, (4, 7, 9)>  
<8, (5, 7, 9)>  
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
