Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes with the number of neighbors:

Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 2 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 2 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 2 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now we will count the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 14 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
