Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a clearer way:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 3, 5, 7
- 1: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- 2: 8
- 3: 0, 1, 5
- 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- 6: 1, 9
- 7: 0
- 8: 1, 2, 5
- 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0, we have 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7), so there are [1] 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 1, we have 5 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 8, 9), so there are [10] 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>.

For node 5, we have 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 8, 9), so there are [10] 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
