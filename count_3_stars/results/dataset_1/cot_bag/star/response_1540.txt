Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 1), (3, 8), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 9), (6, 4), (6, 8), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 5)

Now, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, and 8
- Node 5 has neighbors 0 and 9
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 3, and 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) as it has less than 3 neighbors
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1] = [2].

The unique 3-stars are: <<1, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>>.
