Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
    2 - 9 - 8
     \   | /
       3-6
       | |
       7-4-1
        \|
          0
```

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 4, and 8
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 4, and 7
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 1, and 7
- Node 6 has neighbors 3, 7, and 9
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 4, and 6
- Node 9 has neighbors 2, 6, and 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6. 

Hence, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>.
