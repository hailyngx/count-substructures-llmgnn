Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's visualize the graph connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's identify the nodes having three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- For node 7, there is only 1 3-star.
- For node 8, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.

Adding them all up, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 13.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<0, (7, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 0, 8)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 0, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
