Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has no neighbors.
- Node 2 has no neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor (8).
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 7) -> 1 3-star formed.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 7) -> 1 3-star formed.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 8, 8) -> 1 3-star formed.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 5) -> 1 3-star formed.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 6) -> 1 3-star formed.
- Node 9 has no neighbors.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are <4, (5, 7, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, and <8, (3, 6, 6)>.
