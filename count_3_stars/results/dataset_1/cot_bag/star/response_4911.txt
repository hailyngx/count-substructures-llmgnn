Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
   0 -- 4
 /       \
8         7 -- 1
           | \ |
           |   3
           | / |
           2   6 -- 9
```

Now, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 6

There are 6 nodes with at least 3 neighbors (nodes 6 and 7 have 4 neighbors). Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, there are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph: <6, (2, 7, 9)> and <7, (1, 2, 6)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
