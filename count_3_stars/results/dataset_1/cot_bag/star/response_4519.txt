Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, and 9)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 7, and 8)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 9)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (nodes 6 and 7)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (nodes 0 and 6)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (nodes 4 and 5)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, and 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 17.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>
