Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 7, 8)>

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 3)>

Node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 10.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>.
