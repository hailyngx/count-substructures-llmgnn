Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>
