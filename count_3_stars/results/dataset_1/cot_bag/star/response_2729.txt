Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:   
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.  
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, node 6 and node 0.  
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, node 4 and node 7.  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 6, 9), so it can form 10 3-stars.  
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, node 0 and node 4.  
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars.  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.  
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
