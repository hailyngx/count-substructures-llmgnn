Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 7 (1 neighbor)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 4 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 3 (2 neighbors)

Node 7 is the only node with 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars formed by it: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 1 \]

Therefore, the final answer is: [1]
The unique 3-star found is: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
