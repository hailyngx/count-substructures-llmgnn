Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars that can be formed.
- For Node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed.
- For Node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed.

Adding these up, we have a total of 28 3-stars.
Therefore, the final count is [28].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>,
<0, (4, 6, 7)>,
<0, (6, 5, 7)>,
<0, (7, 5, 8)>,
<0, (8, 1, 9)>,
<1, (0, 8, 9)>,
<5, (2, 6, 7)>,
<5, (6, 0, 7)>,
<5, (7, 0, 8)>,
<5, (8, 0, 7)>.
