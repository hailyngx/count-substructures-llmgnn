Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
So, there is <0, (1, 4, 9)>.

For node 1:
There are 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
So, there is <1, (0, 4, 7)>.

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
So, there are <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 3:
There are 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
So, there are <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>.

For node 4:
There are 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
So, there are <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 4, 8)>.

For node 7:
There are 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
So, there are <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 7)>.

Putting all unique 3-stars together, we have:
[1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [30].
Therefore, there are a total of 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
