Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the nodes with three or more neighbors. Here is the list of such nodes:
- Node 0 (with neighbors 2, 4, 6)
- Node 1 (with neighbors 2, 3, 6, 7)
- Node 2 (with neighbors 0, 1, 5, 9)
- Node 3 (with neighbors 1, 5, 9)
- Node 5 (with neighbors 2, 3, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 6 (with neighbors 0, 1, 5)
- Node 9 (with neighbors 2, 3, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
