Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's analyze the nodes and their neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: It has neighbors {4, 8}. As it has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with this node.

2. Node 1: It has neighbors {3, 5}. As it has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with this node.

3. Node 3: It has neighbor {1}. As it has only 1 neighbor, no 3-star can be formed with this node.

4. Node 4: It has neighbors {0, 9}. It also has 1 additional edge which can form a 3-star: (0, 8). So, there is 1 3-star formed with central node 4: <4, (0, 8, 9)>.

5. Node 5: It has neighbors {1, 8}. As it has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with this node.

6. Node 6: It has neighbors {7, 8}. As it has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with this node.

7. Node 7: It has neighbors {6, 9}. As it has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with this node.

8. Node 8: It has neighbors {0, 5, 6, 9}. It also has 1 additional edge which can form a 3-star: (0, 4). So, there are 4 3-stars formed with central node 8:
   <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.

9. Node 9: It has neighbors {4, 7, 8}. It has 2 additional edges which can form 3-stars: (0, 4) and (7, 9). So, there are 3 3-stars formed with central node 9:
   <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [1 + 4 + 3] = [8]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>.
