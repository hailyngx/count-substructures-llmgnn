Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 8)]

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, 6, 7, 8  
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars with node 0.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, 4, 6  
1 3-star with node 1.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: Node 1, 7  
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \] 3-stars with node 4.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors: Node 0, 1  
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \] 3-stars with node 6.

Node 7 has 2 neighbors: Node 0, 4  
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \] 3-stars with node 7.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: Node 0, 2, 3, 9  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars with node 8.

Node 2 has 1 neighbor: Node 8  
\[ \binom{1}{3} = 0 \] 3-stars with node 2.

Node 3 has 1 neighbor: Node 8  
\[ \binom{1}{3} = 0 \] 3-stars with node 3.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor: Node 8  
\[ \binom{1}{3} = 0 \] 3-stars with node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0] = [15] \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 15. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 9, 8)>
