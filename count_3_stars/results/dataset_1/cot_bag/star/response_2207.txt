Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first define the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star formed)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star formed)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars formed)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars formed)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star formed)

Adding these up, we have a total of 11 unique 3-stars in the graph:
\[ [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [11] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 8)>
