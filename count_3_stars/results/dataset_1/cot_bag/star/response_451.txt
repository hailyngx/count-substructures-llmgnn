Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 5, 6, 9
- 1: 4, 7
- 2: 8, 9
- 3: 5, 7, 9
- 4: 1
- 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
- 6: 0, 8
- 7: 1, 3, 5
- 8: 2, 5, 6
- 9: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 0: [3 stars]
- (0, 5, 6)
- (0, 5, 9)
- (0, 6, 8)
- (0, 9, 2)

For node 3: [1 star]
- (3, 5, 7)

For node 5: [3 stars]
- (5, 0, 6)
- (5, 0, 9)
- (5, 3, 7)
- (5, 8, 2)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <3, (5, 7, 0)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 9, 3)>, and <5, (3, 7, 1)>.
