Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then we will count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes. 

Now let's list the nodes with three or more neighbors:  

- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7 has neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 5, 7

Based on these nodes, we can find the total number of 3-stars: 

- For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. This gives us a total of 4 3-stars centered at node 5. The unique 3-stars are <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>.
  
- For node 6, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. This gives us 1 3-star centered at node 6 which is <6, (0, 2, 4)>.

- For node 7, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars centered at node 7.

- For node 8, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars centered at node 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1] = 5.  
The unique 3-stars are: <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>.
