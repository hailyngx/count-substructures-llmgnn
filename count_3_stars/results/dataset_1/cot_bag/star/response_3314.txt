Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. From the edge list provided, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 6, node 7, and node 9 have at least three neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2, we have 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 6. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). 
   <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- For node 3, we have 3 neighbors: 2, 8, and 9. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is also \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- For node 4, we have 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 7. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- For node 6, we have 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- For node 7, we have 3 neighbors: 4, 6, and 8. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is also \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- For node 9, we have 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 3. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 15 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [15].
