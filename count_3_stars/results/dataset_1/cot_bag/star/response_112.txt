Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 36 

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 0)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 0, 1)>
<7, (2, 0, 9)>
<7, (2, 1, 0)>
<7, (2, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
