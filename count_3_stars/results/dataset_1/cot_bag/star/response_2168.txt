Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    1---4---7
   /|\ /|  /|
  0 3 2 6 8 9 
   \| \| /|
    5---|||
        8
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7). Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9). Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6). Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8). Hence, it forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8). Hence, it forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 6.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 6). Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5). Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 8). Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9). Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: (9, 1), (9, 8). Hence, it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10. So, we write this as [10] and list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 2)>, <1, (0, 3, 2)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
