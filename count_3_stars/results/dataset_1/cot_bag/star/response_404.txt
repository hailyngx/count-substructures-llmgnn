Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
