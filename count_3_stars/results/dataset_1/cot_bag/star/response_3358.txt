Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has degree 7, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has degree 4, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has degree 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has degree 6, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has degree 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has degree 1, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 8 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has degree 2, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each eligible node, we get a total of 35 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 91.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [91].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
