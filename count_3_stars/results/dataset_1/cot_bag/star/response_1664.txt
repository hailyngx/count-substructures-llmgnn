Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 5, 9
Node 3: 7
Node 5: 1, 6, 8
Node 6: 0, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 3
Node 8: 5, 6
Node 9: 0, 1

We see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 5, 6, and 8. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3 (1 from node 0, 1 from node 5, and 1 from node 6).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, and <6, (0, 5, 8)>.
