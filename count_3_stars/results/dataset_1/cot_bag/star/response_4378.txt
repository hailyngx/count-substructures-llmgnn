Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6

Let's compute the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 1: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 6: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$
- Node 9: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

Adding them up: $4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 44$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>.
