Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 and the edges are provided. Let's analyze each node to determine if it can form a 3-star:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9. It can form 1 3-star. 
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7. It cannot form a 3-star. 
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 9. It can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6. It can form 1 3-star. 
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 9. It can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6. It can form 1 3-star. 
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8. It can form 10 3-stars. 
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9. It can form 10 3-stars. 
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 9. It can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7. It can form 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 39\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39], and the unique 3-stars are:
