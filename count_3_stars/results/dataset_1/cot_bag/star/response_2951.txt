Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 48 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
