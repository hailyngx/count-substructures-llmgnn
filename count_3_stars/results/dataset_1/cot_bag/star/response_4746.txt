Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: There is only 1 3-star with Node 1 as center
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 

\[ 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
