Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: Node 2, Node 3, and Node 5.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- The number of 3-stars formed around Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars involving Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>

For Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
- The number of 3-stars formed around Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars involving Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars formed around Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars involving Node 5: <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>.
