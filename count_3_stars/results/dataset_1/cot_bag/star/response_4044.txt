Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [13] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (7, 0, 9)>
<7, (7, 3, 4)>
<7, (7, 3, 0)>
<7, (7, 3, 9)>
