Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 3 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from the above calculations, we have: [1 + 3 + 1] = [5].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>.
