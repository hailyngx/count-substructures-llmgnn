Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 31 3-stars in this graph [31].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
