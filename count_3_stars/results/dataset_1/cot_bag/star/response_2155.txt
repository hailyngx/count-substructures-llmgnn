Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
