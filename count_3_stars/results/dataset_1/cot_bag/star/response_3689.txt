Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 19 \]

So, there are 19 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 9, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
