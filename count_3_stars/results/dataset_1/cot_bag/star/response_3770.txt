Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
