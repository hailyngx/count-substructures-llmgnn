Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars involving these nodes.

For node 0, there are 3 possible 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 9, 5)>
- <0, (5, 2, 9)>

For node 2, there is 1 possible 3-star:
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 4, there is 1 possible 3-star:
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>

For node 9, there are 3 possible 3-stars:
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 0, 4)>
- <9, (4, 2, 0)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 9, 5)>
- <0, (5, 2, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 0, 4)>
- <9, (4, 2, 0)>
