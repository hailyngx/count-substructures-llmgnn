Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 7), (3, 9), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 7), (6, 4), 
(6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, let's determine the 3-star configurations in this graph:

Node 1 forms 4 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 7 forms 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Adding these up gives a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
