Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
