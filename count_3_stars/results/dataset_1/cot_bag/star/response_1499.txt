Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 9, 4)>, <2, (4, 9, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (3, 9, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (4, 9, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>
