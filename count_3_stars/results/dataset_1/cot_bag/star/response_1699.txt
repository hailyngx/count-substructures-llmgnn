Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
0: 3, 6
1: 5
3: 0, 4
4: 3, 8
5: 1, 7, 9
6: 0
7: 5, 8, 9
8: 4, 7, 9
9: 5, 7, 8

Let's find the 3-stars:

For node 0, it has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
For node 1, it has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
For node 3, it has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
For node 4, it has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
For node 5, it has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
For node 6, it has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
For node 7, it has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
For node 8, it has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
For node 9, it has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
