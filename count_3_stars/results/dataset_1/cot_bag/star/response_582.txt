Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are given as follows:

Node 0: 6  
Node 1: 2, 3, 9  
Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8  
Node 3: 1, 4  
Node 4: 2, 3, 8  
Node 5: 6, 8  
Node 6: 0, 2, 5  
Node 8: 2, 4, 5  
Node 9: 1  

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 8 3-star graphs. So, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
