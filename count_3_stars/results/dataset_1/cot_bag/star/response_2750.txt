Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 (6 neighbors)
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6 (5 neighbors)
Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 3, 9 (3 neighbors)
Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 7 (2 neighbors)

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 1)>, <0, (3, 1, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 1)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 5)>, <0, (4, 3, 5)>, <0, (4, 3, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 0, 5)>, <3, (4, 0, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 0, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (6, 0, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>
