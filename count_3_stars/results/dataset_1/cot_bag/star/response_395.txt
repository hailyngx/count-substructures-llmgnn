Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 35 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 79 \) 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [79].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
