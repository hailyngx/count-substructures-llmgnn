Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
{(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 4),
(5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 5), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
Node 3 has 2 neighbors
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 7 has 1 neighbor
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 6: C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
