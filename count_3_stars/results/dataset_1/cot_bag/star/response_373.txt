Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
We will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors first.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15

So, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 0, 4>,
<3, 2, 5>,
<3, 5, 6>,
<3, 4, 5>,
<3, 5, 9>,
<4, 0, 5>,
<5, 3, 4>,
<5, 4, 6>,
<5, 6, 9>,
<6, 3, 4>,
<6, 4, 5>,
<6, 5, 7>,
<6, 7, 8>,
<8, 1, 3>,
<8, 3, 7>
