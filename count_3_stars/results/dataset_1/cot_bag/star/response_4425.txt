Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 1 = 15, which we put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
