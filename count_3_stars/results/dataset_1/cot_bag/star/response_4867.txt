Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 3

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7 each have three or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars based on those nodes:
- Node 0 can form 3-stars with 2 out of its 3 neighbors (1, 6). So, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with 3 out of its 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 1.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with 3 out of its 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6.
- Node 7 can form 3-stars with 2 out of its 3 neighbors (2, 8). So, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars with node 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <1, (4, 5, 7)>.
