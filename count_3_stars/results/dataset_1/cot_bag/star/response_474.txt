Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows: 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9. So, there are C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
Node 3 has neighbors 1, 4, 5, 8. So, there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, 5, 7. So, there are C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding these up, we have a total of [10 + 4 + 10] = 24 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
