Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  (exactly 3 neighbors) -> <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  -> <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (1, 6, 3)>
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 -> <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  (exactly 3 neighbors) -> <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 8: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Considering all the cases above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 16, thus the final answer is [16].
