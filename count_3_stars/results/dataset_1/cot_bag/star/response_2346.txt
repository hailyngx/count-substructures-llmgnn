Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: neighbors are 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 2, 7
- Node 7: neighbors are 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, 8

Now let's count the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least three neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 34

So, there are 34 3-stars in total. Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[1, 0, 2], [1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 8], [1, 2, 9], [1, 3, 8], [1, 7, 2], [1, 8, 3], [1, 8, 4], [1, 8, 9], [2, 0, 1], [2, 0, 7], [2, 0, 9], [2, 1, 0], [2, 1, 6], [2, 1, 7], [2, 1, 9], [2, 6, 1], [2, 7, 1], [2, 7, 6], [2, 7, 9], [2, 9, 1], [2, 9, 7], [2, 9, 3], [8, 1, 3], [8, 1, 4], [8, 1, 9], [8, 3, 1], [8, 3, 9], [8, 4, 1], [8, 4, 9], [8, 9, 1], [8, 9, 3], [8, 9, 4], [9, 2, 3], [9, 2, 4], [9, 2, 5], [9, 2, 8]> 

Therefore, there are 34 unique 3-stars in this graph.
