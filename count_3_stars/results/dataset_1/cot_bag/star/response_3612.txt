Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 2, node 4, node 6, node 7, node 8, and node 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8), so it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
