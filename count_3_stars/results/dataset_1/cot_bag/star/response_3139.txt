Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
