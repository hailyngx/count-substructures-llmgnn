Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 0, node 4, and node 7.

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 8.
Number of 3-stars = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
<0, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 4:
There are 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 6.
Number of 3-stars = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
<4, (0, 1, 6)>

For node 7:
There are 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
Number of 3-stars = $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
<7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12
So, the final answer is  [12].
