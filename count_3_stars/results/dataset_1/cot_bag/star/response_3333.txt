Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's start by examining each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed.   

Node 0: 1 neighbor (9, 0) - No 3-star can be formed.   
Node 1: No neighbors - No 3-star can be formed.   
Node 2: 2 neighbors (4, 2), (5, 2) - No 3-star can be formed.   
Node 3: No neighbors - No 3-star can be formed.   
Node 4: 2 neighbors (2, 4), (8, 4) - No 3-star can be formed.   
Node 5: 3 neighbors (2, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5) - 1 3-star can be formed.   
Node 6: 2 neighbors (8, 6), (9, 6) - No 3-star can be formed.   
Node 7: 1 neighbor (8, 7) - No 3-star can be formed.   
Node 8: 4 neighbors (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8) - 1 3-star can be formed.   
Node 9: 4 neighbors (0, 9), (2, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9) - 1 3-star can be formed.   

Total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 3

So, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [3].   
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:   
<5, (2, 5, 8)>   
<8, (4, 5, 6)>   
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
