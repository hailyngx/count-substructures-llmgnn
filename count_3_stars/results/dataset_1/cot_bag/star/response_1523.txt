Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 8, 9. So, it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 6, 8 and nodes 2, 6, 9. So, it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, 5. So, it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, and <5, (2, 6, 9)>.
