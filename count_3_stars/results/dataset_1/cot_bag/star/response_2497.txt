Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 7, 9
Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 4, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
