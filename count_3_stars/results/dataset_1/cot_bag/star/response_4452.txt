Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we'll examine each node that has at least three neighbors.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 5, so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, and 8. 
- There are 2 possible 3-stars with node 2: <2, (0, 7, 8)> and <2, (1, 7, 8)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 7.
- There is 1 possible 3-star with node 3: <3, (4, 5, 7)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9, 5.
- There are 3 possible 3-stars with node 4: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, and <4, (3, 6, 9)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 0.
- There is 1 possible 3-star with node 5: <5, (0, 3, 4)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 2.
- There is 1 possible 3-star with node 7: <7, (2, 3, 8)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 7.
- There is 1 possible 3-star with node 8: <8, (2, 7, 7)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

In total, there are 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
