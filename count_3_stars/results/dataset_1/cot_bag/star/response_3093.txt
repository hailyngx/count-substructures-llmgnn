Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to determine how many 3-stars can be formed around each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 6)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
