Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: There's only 1 3-star with node 1 as the center
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 1 + 4 = 9\). 

Therefore, the final answer is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
