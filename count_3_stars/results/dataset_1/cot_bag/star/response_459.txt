Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 7), (8, 9)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Degree 3 (neighbors: 2, 6, 9)
  - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

- Node 2: Degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7)
  - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 4: Degree 3 (neighbors: 1, 6, 9)
  - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

- Node 6: Degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7)
  - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

- Node 9: Degree 4 (neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8)
  - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

So, the total number of 3-stars is [14].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)> 

So, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)>.
