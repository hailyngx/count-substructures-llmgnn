Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

For node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 7) -> Total 3-stars: [3]
For node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 9), (1, 4, 9) -> Total 3-stars: [3]
For node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 8), (2, 0, 9), (2, 3, 8), (2, 8, 9) -> Total 3-stars: [5]
For node 3: (3, 2, 6), (3, 2, 8) -> Total 3-stars: [2]
For node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 1, 8), (4, 7, 8) -> Total 3-stars: [3]
For node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 0, 5), (7, 4, 5) -> Total 3-stars: [3]
For node 8: (8, 2, 3), (8, 2, 9) -> Total 3-stars: [2]
For node 9: (9, 1, 2), (9, 1, 6), (9, 1, 8), (9, 2, 6), (9, 2, 8) -> Total 3-stars: [5]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get [3 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 5] = [26].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>.
