Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.
Since there are 10 nodes, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor (Node 5). No 3-star can be formed with Node 0.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (Node 9). No 3-star can be formed with Node 1.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 4, 5).
- Since Node 2 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 5, 8).
- Since Node 3 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (Nodes 2, 5). No 3-star can be formed with Node 4.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors (Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8).
- Node 5 has more than 3 neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node.
- The unique 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node are:
  <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>,
  <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>,
  <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>,
  <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (Nodes 7). No 3-star can be formed with Node 6.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (Nodes 5, 6, 8, 9).
- Node 7 has more than 3 neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node.
- The unique 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node are:
  <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9)>.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 7, 9).
- Since Node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 7, 9)>.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 7, 8).
- Since Node 9 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \[ 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) + 20 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 9) = 34 \].

Thus, the final answer, inside brackets, is [34].
