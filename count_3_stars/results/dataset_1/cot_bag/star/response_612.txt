Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

The given edge list shows the connections between the nodes. Let's organize the information:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9. <6, (5, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
