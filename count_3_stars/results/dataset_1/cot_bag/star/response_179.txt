Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {0, 5, 8, 9}
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {4, 5}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 7}
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 9}
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 8}

Based on the nodes and their neighbors, the 3-stars are as follows:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
