Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 11. 

Therefore, the answer is: [11]
The unique 3-stars are: <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 6)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 3)>, <3, (0, 5, 1)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 2)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>
