Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17\)

Therefore, the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
