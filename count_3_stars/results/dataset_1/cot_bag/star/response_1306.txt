Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 7

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8), thus forming inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8), thus forming inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 9), thus forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 + 4 = 44.

Therefore, the final answer is [44] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 2)>
- <0, (1, 7, 4)>
- <0, (2, 4, 1)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (4, 1, 7)>
- <0, (4, 1, 2)>
- <0, (4, 2, 1)>
- <0, (4, 2, 8)>
- <0, (4, 8, 2)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 1)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 0, 7)>
- <4, (1, 0, 2)>
- <4, (1, 7, 0)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 0, 1)>
- <4, (2, 0, 8)>
- <4, (2, 4, 0)>
- <4, (2, 8, 0)>
- <4, (5, 0, 8)>
- <4, (5, 8, 0)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 4, 1)>
- <7, (1, 0, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 0)>
