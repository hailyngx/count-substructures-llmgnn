Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, and 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 7, and 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, and 9), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 \), which we will represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 1, 4)>
<0, (8, 1, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 0, 7)>
<1, (2, 0, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 1, 8)>
<9, (8, 1, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 1)>
