Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
