Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars within this graph:

Considering each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 4 forms 3 three-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 three-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 three-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 9 3-stars in this graph. So, the final count is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 3)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 2, 9)>
