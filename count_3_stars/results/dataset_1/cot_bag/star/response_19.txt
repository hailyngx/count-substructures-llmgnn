Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. 
Here are the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 9: neighbors {6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes above, we get a total of \( 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 43 \) 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
