Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will follow the steps mentioned earlier:

1. Identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

3. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 9) = 5 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
