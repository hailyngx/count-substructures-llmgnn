Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7, 8

Node 0 has 1 neighbor, Node 3 has 2 neighbors, and Nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7 have 3 neighbors each.
  
We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

For Node 1:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 6:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]

For Node 7:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]

Summing up the number of 3-stars we get: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 0 + 0] = [2] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
\[ <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)> \]
