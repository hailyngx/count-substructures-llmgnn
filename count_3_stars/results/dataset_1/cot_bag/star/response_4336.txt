Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's analyze the nodes to see which ones have at least three neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 4, and 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 6, 7, and 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors 4, 6, and 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 2, 3, and 6 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 3, 4 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11 \).

So, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>
