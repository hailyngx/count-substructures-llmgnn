Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 10 = 11

So, there are 11 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are: <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 7, 9)>, and <7, (4, 8, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
