Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6)
(1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9)
(2, 8), (2, 9)
(3, 0)
(4, 5)
(5, 0), (5, 4)
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8)
(7, 9)
(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 9)
(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Next, we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors {3, 5, 6}, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>

Node 1 has neighbors {6, 8, 9}, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<1, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 2 has neighbors {8, 9}, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<2, (8, 9)>

Node 8 has neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9}, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

Node 9 has neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}, so it can form 1 3-star. 
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 7, which we represent as [7].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.
