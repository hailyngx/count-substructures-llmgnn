Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 1: 2, 7
Node 2: 0, 1, 3
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 9
Node 7: 1, 5
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 16 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is [16].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 0)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>.
