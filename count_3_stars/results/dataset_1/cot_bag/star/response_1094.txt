Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 0: has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8) - [1 3-star]
Node 1: has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5) - [1 3-star]
Node 2: has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 9) - [1 3-star]
Node 3: has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7) - [1 3-star]
Node 4: has 6 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8) - [4 3-stars]
Node 5: has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4) - [1 3-star]
Node 6: has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7) - [1 3-star]
Node 7: has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8) - [1 3-star]
Node 8: has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9) - [1 3-star]
Node 9: has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8) - [1 3-star]

There are a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 2, 4> 
<1, 3, 4> 
<2, 4, 9> 
<3, 4, 6> 
<4, 5, 8> 
<4, 6, 7>
