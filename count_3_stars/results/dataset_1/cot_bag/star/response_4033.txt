Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \(4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 0 = 53\)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>.
