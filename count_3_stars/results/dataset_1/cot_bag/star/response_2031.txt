Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: [4]
- Node 1: [2, 5]
- Node 2: [1, 6, 7]
- Node 3: [5, 7, 9]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [1, 3, 9]
- Node 6: [2, 8, 9]
- Node 7: [2, 3]
- Node 8: [6, 9]
- Node 9: [3, 5, 6, 8]

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

For Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
For Node 3: <3, (5, 9, 6)>
For Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 9)>
For Node 6: <6, (2, 8, 9)>
For Node 9: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
