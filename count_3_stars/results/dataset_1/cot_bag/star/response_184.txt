Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 17 \]

Therefore, there are 17 3-stars in the provided graph. 

The unique 3-stars are represented as follows:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>
