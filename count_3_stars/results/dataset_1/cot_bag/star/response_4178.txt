Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 4 has three neighbors: 3, 6, and 7, forming one 3-star <4, (3, 6, 7)>.

Thus, there is one 3-star in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
