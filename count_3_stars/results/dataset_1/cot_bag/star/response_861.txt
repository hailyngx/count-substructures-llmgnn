Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will first examine each node to see how many neighbors it has and determine if it can be the center of a 3-star. 

Let's analyze each node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 8).
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 7).
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Nodes 1 and 8 have the potential to form 3-stars. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possibilities.  
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possibilities.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [10 + 10] = [20] \).

The unique 3-stars are:   
<1, (3, 5, 7)>  
<1, (3, 5, 8)>  
<1, (3, 7, 8)>  
<1, (5, 7, 8)>  

<8, (0, 1, 3)>  
<8, (1, 3, 5)>  
<8, (1, 3, 7)>  
<8, (1, 5, 7)>  
<8, (0, 1, 7)>  
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
