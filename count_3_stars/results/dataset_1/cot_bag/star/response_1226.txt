Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>
