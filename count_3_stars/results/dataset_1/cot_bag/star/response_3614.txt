Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we'll first analyze each node to see which nodes are directly connected to it. Then, we'll count the number of 3-stars around each node that has three or more neighbors.

Here is the breakdown of the 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6. There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars around node 0:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>

Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9. There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars around node 2:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9. There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars around node 3:
<3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8. There is 1 3-star around node 5:
<5, (0, 1, 8)>

Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7. There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars around node 8:
<8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 17.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
