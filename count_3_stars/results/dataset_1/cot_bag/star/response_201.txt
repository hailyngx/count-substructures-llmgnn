Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 7)
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)
Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4)
Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9)
Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 9)
Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 
Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 
Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7, which we will enclose in brackets as [7].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
