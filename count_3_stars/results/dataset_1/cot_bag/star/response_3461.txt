Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 2:  $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 3:  $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 6:  $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 8:  $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars
- Node 9:  $ \binom{2}{3} = 0 $ 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16$, which we'll put inside brackets: [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 0, 3)>
- <2, (6, 3, 7)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 3, 9)>
- <3, (6, 0, 2)>
- <6, (0, 2, 1)>
- <6, (2, 1, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 3)>
- <6, (7, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <8, (7, 6, 2)>
- <8, (9, 2, 1)>
