Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's determine the 3-stars and their total count.

Looking at each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, and 9. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, and 9. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 6. It can't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 6. It can't form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 1. It can't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 4. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 1. It can't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 2. It can't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, and 9. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 23 \).

Therefore, there are 23 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
