Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

For each node, let's find out how many neighbors it has:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, we have found the number of neighbors for each node. We'll identify which nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

Node 3, 5, 6, and 7 are the only nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 7)>

- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <5, (6, 7, 0)>

- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <6, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (4, 5, 3)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
