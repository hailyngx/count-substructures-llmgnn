Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 3, 6, 9
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 7: 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 3 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives [1 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [43].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<>
<(0, 3, 9)>
<(3, 4, 8)>
<(3, 4, 9)>
<(3, 6, 9)>
<(4, 6, 9)>
<(6, 8, 9)>
