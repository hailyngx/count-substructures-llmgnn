Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each such node.

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 4.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 8.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [24]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
