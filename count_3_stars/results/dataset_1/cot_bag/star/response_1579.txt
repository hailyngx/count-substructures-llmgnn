Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.

For node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>.

For node 1, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>.

For node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 3)>.

For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 3)>, <3, (0, 9, 6)>.

For node 8, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <8, (1, 6, 9)>.

For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 24 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is [24].
