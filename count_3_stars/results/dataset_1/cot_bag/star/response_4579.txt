Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 1: has 1 neighbor
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors
- Node 3: has 1 neighbor
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors
- Node 5: has 1 neighbor
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors

Nodes 4 and 9 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10+10] = 20.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>

So the final answer is [20].
