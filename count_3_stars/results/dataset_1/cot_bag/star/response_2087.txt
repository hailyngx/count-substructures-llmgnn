Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with more than three neighbors: node 3, node 4, node 5, and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 5
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 1 (as it has only 3 neighbors)
- Unique 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 3, 5)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: 1 (as it has only 3 neighbors)
- Unique 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 9) = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
