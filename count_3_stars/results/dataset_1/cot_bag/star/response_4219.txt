Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can analyze the graph to identify the total number of 3-stars formed and their unique configurations.

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>
