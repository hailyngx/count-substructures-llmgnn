Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Edges: 
(0, 4)
(1, 3)
(1, 6)
(3, 1)
(3, 4)
(3, 6)
(4, 0)
(4, 3)
(4, 5)
(5, 4)
(5, 6)
(6, 1)
(6, 3)
(6, 5)
(6, 7)
(7, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have a degree of 3 or more, as these nodes can potentially form 3-stars:

Nodes with degree 3 or more: {3, 4, 6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 6, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
