Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given in pairs. 
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph by checking each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8}. It forms 1 3-star. 
2. Node 1: Neighbors {6, 9}. It forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}. It forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
4. Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}. It forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
5. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4}. It forms 1 3-star. 
6. Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2}. It forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 9}. It forms 1 3-star.
8. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4)>
<6, (1, 2)>
<8, (0, 9)>
<9, (1, 8)>
