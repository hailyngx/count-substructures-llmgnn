Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
By counting the number of neighbors for each node, we can determine the central nodes of the 3-stars. Here is the breakdown:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 55 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [55].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
