Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0: neighbors 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: neighbors 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: neighbors 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: neighbors 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 3, 4, 6, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>.
