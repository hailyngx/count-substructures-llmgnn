Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 7, 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0:
With 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9), we have 1 3-star.
For node 1:
With 3 neighbors (4, 5, 8), we have 1 3-star.
For node 4:
With 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7, 8), we have 5 3-stars.
For node 7:
With 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 9), we have 5 3-stars.
For node 9:
With 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8), we have 1 3-star.

Adding these up gives a total of 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 13 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>.
