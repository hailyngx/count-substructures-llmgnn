Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 10 + 1 + 4] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 3, 6, 8>
- <3, 0, 4, 7>
- <3, 0, 8, 6>
- <3, 4, 8, 6>
- <3, 0, 8, 4>
- <3, 4, 8, 0>
- <4, 0, 1, 8>
- <4, 0, 8, 1>
- <8, 3, 4, 6>
- <8, 3, 6, 4>
