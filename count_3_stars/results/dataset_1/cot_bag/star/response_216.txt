Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 2, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, there are \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17 \) 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is 17, and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 5)>
<1, (6, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (7, 6, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (1, 8, 3)>
<1, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 9, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 6)> 

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [17].
