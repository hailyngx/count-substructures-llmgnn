Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph:

```
   1 --- 0 --- 2
   |          |
   9          9
             /
            8
            |
            3
            |
            6 â€” 5
```

From the graph, we can see node 0 has 3 neighbors and will form 1 3-star.  
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, and nodes 3, 4, and 6 each have 1 neighbor only, so they won't form any 3-stars.  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
\[ \binom{1}{3} = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].

The unique 3-star in this graph is <0, (1, 2, 9)>.
