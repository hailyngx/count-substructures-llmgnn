Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can determine the degrees of each node:

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 2
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 3

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 \]

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 15, hence [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<0, (4, 3, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<2, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
