Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: This node has 2 3-stars.
2. Node 2: This node has 2 3-stars.
3. Node 3: This node has 2 3-stars.
4. Node 4: This node has 3 3-stars.
5. Node 6: This node has 1 3-star.
6. Node 7: This node has 1 3-star.
7. Node 8: This node has 1 3-star.
8. Node 9: This node has 3 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes, we get:
2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

List of unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
