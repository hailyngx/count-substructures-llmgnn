Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all these nodes: 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
