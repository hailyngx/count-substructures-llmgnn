Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
