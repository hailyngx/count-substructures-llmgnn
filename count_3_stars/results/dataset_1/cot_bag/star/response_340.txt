Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 8, 9)>
  - <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <3, (1, 2, 9)>
  - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [20 + 4 + 10] = 34.
