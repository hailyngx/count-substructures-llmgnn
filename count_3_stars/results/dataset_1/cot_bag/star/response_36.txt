Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The node degrees for this graph are as follows:  
- Node 0 has degree 4  
- Node 1 has degree 1  
- Node 2 has degree 1  
- Node 3 has degree 2  
- Node 4 has degree 5  
- Node 6 has degree 3  
- Node 7 has degree 4  
- Node 8 has degree 4  
- Node 9 has degree 2  

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 4: 3-stars = [4]
- Node 7: 3-stars = [1]
- Node 8: 3-stars = [1]
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (3, 0, 9)>
- <4, (8, 6, 7)>
- <4, (9, 0, 3)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
