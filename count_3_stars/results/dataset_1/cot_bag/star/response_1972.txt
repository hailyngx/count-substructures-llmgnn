Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 7)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 9)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, 9)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 6, 9)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <2, (1, 6, 7)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <3, (0, 4, 9)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [7].
