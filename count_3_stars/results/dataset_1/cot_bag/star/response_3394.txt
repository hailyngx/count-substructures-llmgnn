Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms <1, (2, 4, 7)> and <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 forms <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, and <9, (1, 3, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
