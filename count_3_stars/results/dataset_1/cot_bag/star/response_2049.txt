Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9. It forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, not enough. 
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, not enough.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8. It forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6. It forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 34.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 34, as given in the initial information. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>.
