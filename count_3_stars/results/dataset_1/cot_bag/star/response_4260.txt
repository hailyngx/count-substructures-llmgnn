Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7)  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7)  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5)  
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4)  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for node 1
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) for node 2
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for node 5
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) for node 7
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) for node 9

Summing up these results:  
\[ [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [17] \]

Therefore, there are 17 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (1, 2, 7)>  
<2, (2, 6, 9)>  
<2, (2, 7, 9)>  
<2, (2, 8, 9)>  
<5, (5, 1, 7)>  
<7, (7, 1, 2)>  
<7, (7, 2, 3)>  
<7, (7, 2, 5)>  
<9, (9, 0, 4)>
