Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Node 0 is connected to node 4.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5.
Node 7 is connected to node 3.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For node 3: 
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
