Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

```
         1
        / \
       /   \
      0  -  3
       \   /
        \ /
         2
      
      4  -  9
       \ / \
        6 -  8
       /     \
      7       5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
  - <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
  - <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
  - <6, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  - <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 
  - <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: \([10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20] = [45]\)

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>

- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
