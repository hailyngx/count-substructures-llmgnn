Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
