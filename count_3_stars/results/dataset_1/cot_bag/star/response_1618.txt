Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The first step is to represent the graph using nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 4), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 8)}

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 3, 8

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each eligible node:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3, and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 4, 5, 9>
- <8, 1, 7, 9>
- <9, 0, 3, 8>

Putting this final count inside brackets, we get the answer: [3].
