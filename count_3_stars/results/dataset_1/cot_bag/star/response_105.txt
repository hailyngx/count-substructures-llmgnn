Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 5, and 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 7, and 0 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 3, and 1 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors 8 and 9 (2 neighbors) 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1] = [3] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 0)>
<5, (1, 3, 1)>
