Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1, we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
For node 3, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 9, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 54 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 8, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4> 

So, the final result is: [54] <1, 8, 9>, <1, 8, 5>, <1, 9, 7>, <1, 9, 5>, <8, 9, 5>, <3, 5, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 2, 4>
