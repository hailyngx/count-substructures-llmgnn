Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 3, 4, and 8.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not forming any 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 4)>
<0, (6, 8, 0)>
<3, (6, 8, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)> 

Put altogether, the final answer is [6].
