Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8)
Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 9)
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7)
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9)
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 8)
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9)
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 9, 1)>
<5, (4, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (7, 1, 3)>
