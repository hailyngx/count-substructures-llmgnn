Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 7}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
Node 9: Neighbors {6}

From the list above, nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of.

For Node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
For Node 4: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
For Node 6: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
For Node 7: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$. So, we put 4 inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
