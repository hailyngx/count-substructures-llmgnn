Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 different 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star:
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 different 3-stars:
<6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Considering all the possible unique 3-stars, we have:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
