Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's map out the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7.

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 18 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 4, 9)>
- <2, (5, 9, 4)>
- <2, (5, 9, 6)>
- <2, (6, 1, 9)>
- <2, (6, 9, 1)>
- <2, (6, 9, 5)>
- <2, (9, 4, 5)>
- <2, (9, 4, 5)>
- <2, (9, 5, 4)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
