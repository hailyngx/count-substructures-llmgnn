Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's list the nodes and their neighbors for easier visualization:

- Node 0: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {6}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (3, 0, 7)>
- <6, (7, 0, 3, 1)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (5, 0, 8)>
- <9, (8, 0, 4, 5)>
