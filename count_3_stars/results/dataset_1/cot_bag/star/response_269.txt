Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighboring nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
