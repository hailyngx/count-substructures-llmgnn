Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [40].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>.
