Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (0, 2, 7)>

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<3, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated:
4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
