Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
The unique 3-stars found within this graph are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<3, (7, 4, 9)>.
