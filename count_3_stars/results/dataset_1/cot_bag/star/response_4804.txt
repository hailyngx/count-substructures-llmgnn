Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

From the nodes listed above, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 5, 6, and 8. 

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- For node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up, we get 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 38.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
