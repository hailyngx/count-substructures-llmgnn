Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
The graph visualization is as follows:

```
     0
    / \
   3   1
       |\
       | 7
       |
       6 -- 8
      /|\
     4 5  1
```

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1 and node 6.

For node 1, there are 2 3-stars since node 1 has exactly 3 neighbors (6, 7, 1). Therefore, we have [2] 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 7, 1)>
- <1, (6, 4, 5)>

For node 6, there are 3 3-stars since node 6 has exactly 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8). Therefore, we have [3] 3-stars:
- <6, (1, 7, 1)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (8, 1, 7)>

Putting it all together, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.
