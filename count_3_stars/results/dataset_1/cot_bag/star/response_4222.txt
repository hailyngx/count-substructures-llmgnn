Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 6, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 7, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 8, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 9, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10] = [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 6)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (7, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
