Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now let's find the 3-stars:

From node 4, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
From node 8, we can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
From node 9, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 4] = [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (9, 5, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 7)>
<9, (1, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 9, 8)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
