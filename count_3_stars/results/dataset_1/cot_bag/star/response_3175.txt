Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars in the graph.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 9
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, and 9
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8, and 2

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 2)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>
