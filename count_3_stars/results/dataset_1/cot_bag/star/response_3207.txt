Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. 

Looking at the provided edge list, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Nodes connected to node 1: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars involving node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 3:
- Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars involving node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 4:
- Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Number of 3-stars involving node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 6:
- Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Number of 3-stars involving node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 8:
- Nodes connected to node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Number of 3-stars involving node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9:
- Nodes connected to node 9: 1, 3, 5
- Number of 3-stars involving node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the 3-stars from each node:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
