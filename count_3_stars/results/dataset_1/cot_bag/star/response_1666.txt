Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 9, which we'll put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>

So, the final result is:
[9] <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>
