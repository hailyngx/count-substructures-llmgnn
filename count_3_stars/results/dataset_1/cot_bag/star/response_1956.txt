Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 37 \).
Therefore, the answer is [37].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
