Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are given below:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 8}

We observe that nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8 have at least three neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars with these nodes.

For Node 1:
- Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>

For Node 2:
- Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>

For Node 3:
- Total 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>

For Node 8:
- Total 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars from each node gives us a total of 22 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [22].
