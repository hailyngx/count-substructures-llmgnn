Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \(\binom{1}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars formed = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

So, the final result is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
