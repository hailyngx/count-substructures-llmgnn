Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 43\)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>.
