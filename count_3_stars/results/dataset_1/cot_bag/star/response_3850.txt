Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.

Let's determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 
\[ [20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [57] \]

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
