Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list for better visualization:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up gives us a total of 2 3-stars. So, the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
