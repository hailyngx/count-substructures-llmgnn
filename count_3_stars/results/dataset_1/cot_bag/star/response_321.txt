Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 3 neighbors for node 0 (1, 3, 7). So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<0, (1, 3, 7)>).

- Node 1: There are 4 neighbors for node 1 (0, 2, 5, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>).

- Node 2: There are 3 neighbors for node 2 (1, 3, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<2, (1, 3, 8)>).

- Node 3: There are 2 neighbors for node 3 (0, 2). As there are less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with node 3 as the center.

- Node 5: There are 3 neighbors for node 5 (1, 4, 6). So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<5, (1, 4, 6)>).

- Node 6: There are 3 neighbors for node 6 (4, 5, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<6, (4, 5, 9)>).

- Node 8: There are 2 neighbors for node 8 (1, 2). As there are less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with node 8 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
