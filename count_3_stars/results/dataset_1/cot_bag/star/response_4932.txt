Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: neighbors {1, 8}
Node 1: neighbors {0, 8}
Node 3: neighbors {4, 5, 9}
Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 7}
Node 5: neighbors {3, 7, 9}
Node 7: neighbors {4, 5, 8}
Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 7}
Node 9: neighbors {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 0: none
Node 1: none
Node 3: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: none
Node 9: [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
