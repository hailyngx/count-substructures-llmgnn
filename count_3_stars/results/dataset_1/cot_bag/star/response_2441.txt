Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Looking at the degrees of the nodes:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Nodes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will focus on these nodes. 

For node 1: 
- It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 3:
- It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 5:
- It forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 8:
- It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 9:
- It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 17 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>.
