Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 0, 6

Let's find the 3-stars:  
For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
For node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
For node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
For node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 13  

So, there are 13 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (3, 8, 9)>  
<3, (0, 1, 8)>  
<3, (0, 1, 4)>  
<3, (1, 4, 8)>  
<4, (3, 5, 6)>  
<4, (3, 6, 7)>  
<4, (5, 6, 7)>  
<6, (1, 4, 9)>  
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
