Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the given criteria:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (5, 4, 8)>,
<4, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 8)>.
