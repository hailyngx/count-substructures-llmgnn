Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see which ones can form 3-stars. 

Node 0: 1 neighbor (5)
Node 1: 6 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7)
Node 3: 1 neighbor (1)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 9)
Node 6: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 9)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9)
Node 9: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6, 7)

Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 43

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
