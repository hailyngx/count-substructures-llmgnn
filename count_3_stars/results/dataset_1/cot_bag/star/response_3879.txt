Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look at each node individually.

Let's examine each node:
- Node 0: Has neighbors 2, 5, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: Has neighbors 3, 4, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Has neighbors 0, 3, 4, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3: Has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 4: Has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 5: Has neighbors 0, 4, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Has neighbors 5, 7, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: Has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 8: Has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9: Has neighbors 3, 6, 7 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 15 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 10 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 15 + 10 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
