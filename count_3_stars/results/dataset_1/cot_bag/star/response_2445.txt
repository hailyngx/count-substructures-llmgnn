Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (5, 9), (7, 2), (8, 3), (9, 5)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5

So, there are 5 3-stars in total. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
