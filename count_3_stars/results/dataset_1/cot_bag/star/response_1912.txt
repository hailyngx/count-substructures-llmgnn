Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

Putting the final number inside brackets: [22]
Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 5)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 7, 5)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 0, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 9)>, 
<8, (4, 0, 5)>, <8, (4, 0, 7)>, <8, (4, 0, 9)>
