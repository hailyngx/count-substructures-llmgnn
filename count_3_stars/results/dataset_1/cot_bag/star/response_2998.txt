Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node that has at least 3 neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in.

Node 1: has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9)
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.

Node 2: has 2 neighbors
No 3-star around node 2.

Node 3: has 2 neighbors
No 3-star around node 3.

Node 4: has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 7)
Node 4 forms 4 3-stars.

Node 6: has 2 neighbors
No 3-star around node 6.

Node 7: has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 8)
Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.

Node 8: has 2 neighbors
No 3-star around node 8.

Node 9: has 2 neighbors
No 3-star around node 9.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
