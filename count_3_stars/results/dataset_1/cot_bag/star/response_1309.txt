Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>.
