Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the unique 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors. 

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate how many 3-star configurations they are part of:

Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>

Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0

Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
<3, (1, 5, 6)>

Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
<4, (1, 2, 6)>

Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0

Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0

Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
