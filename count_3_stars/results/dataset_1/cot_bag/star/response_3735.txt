Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.  
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of 23 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 5, 8)>,  
<0, (1, 5, 3)>,  
<0, (3, 5, 8)>,  
<0, (3, 5, 1)>,  
<1, (0, 5, 6)>,  
<3, (0, 6, 9)>,  
<3, (2, 6, 9)>,  
<3, (6, 9, 4)>,  
<5, (0, 6, 7)>,  
<5, (1, 6, 7)>,  
<5, (3, 6, 7)>,  
<5, (6, 7, 4)>,  
<6, (2, 3, 9)>,  
<6, (3, 5, 7)>,  
<6, (5, 7, 4)>,  
<6, (9, 7, 4)>,  
<9, (3, 4, 6)>,  
<9, (4, 6, 7)>.
