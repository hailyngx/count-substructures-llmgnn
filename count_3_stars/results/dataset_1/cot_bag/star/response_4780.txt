Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edge list, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 9) = 20 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 2, 5)>
<0, (3, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
