Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: 1 3-star
For Node 1: 1 3-star
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: 1 3-star
For Node 4: 1 3-star
For Node 5: 1 3-star
For Node 6: 1 3-star
For Node 7: 1 3-star
For Node 8: No 3-star
For Node 9: No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>
