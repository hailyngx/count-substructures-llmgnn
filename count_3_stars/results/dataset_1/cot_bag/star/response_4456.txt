Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5

Next, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 8), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.

In total, there are 6 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, and <9, (0, 1, 5)>.
