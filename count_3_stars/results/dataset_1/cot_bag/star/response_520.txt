Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0 : {2, 3, 4, 5}  
Node 1 : {2, 3, 4, 9}  
Node 2 : {0, 1, 4}  
Node 3 : {0, 1, 4}  
Node 4 : {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}  
Node 5 : {0, 4}  
Node 7 : {8}  
Node 8 : {4, 7}  
Node 9 : {1, 4}  

Based on the number of neighbors, each node can form a different number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 1 can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 2 and Node 3 can each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5, 7, 8, and 9 cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 35 (from node 4) = 45.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
