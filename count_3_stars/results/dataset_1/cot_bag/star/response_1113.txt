Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we observe that nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: Total 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: Total 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: Total 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: Total 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient for a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all central nodes with three or more neighbors: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:  
<1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, and <7, (1, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
