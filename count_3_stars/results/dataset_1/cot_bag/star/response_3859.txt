Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
There are \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 = 44 \) 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 2, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 6, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>.
