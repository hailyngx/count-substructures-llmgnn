Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 3, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 1, 6)>, <5, (3, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
