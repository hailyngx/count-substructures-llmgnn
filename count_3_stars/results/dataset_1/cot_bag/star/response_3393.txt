Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes (2, 5, 6, 8).
Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes (1, 5, 7, 9).
Node 5 is connected to 5 other nodes (1, 2, 6, 8, 9).
Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 4, 5).
Node 8 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 1, 4, 5).
Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes (2, 5, 7).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5.
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 24 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>.
