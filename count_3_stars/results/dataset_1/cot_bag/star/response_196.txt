Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 50 3-star subgraphs in this graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars is [50].

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
