Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Now, we need to determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1: Only forms 1 3-star <1, (5, 9)>
- Node 2: Only forms 1 3-star <2, (3, 9)>
- Node 3: Forms 4 3-stars <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star <4, (3, 6)>
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1] = 9
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 9, and they are: <1, (5, 9)>, <2, (3, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>
