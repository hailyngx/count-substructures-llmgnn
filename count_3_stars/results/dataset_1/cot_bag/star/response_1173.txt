Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars containing each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars to the total.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, contributing \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, contributing 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1] = 34 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
