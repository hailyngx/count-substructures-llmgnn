Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 2 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
For node 0: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
For node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
For node 4: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
For node 5: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
For node 6: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
For node 8: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
