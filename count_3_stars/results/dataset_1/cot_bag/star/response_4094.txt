Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbor 9
- Node 1: Neighbor 9
- Node 2: Neighbor 4
- Node 3: Neighbor 5
- Node 4: Neighbors 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors 3, 6
- Node 6: Neighbors 5, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors 4, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors 0, 1, 7

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 4 and Node 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 and Node 6 each have 2 neighbors, so they can't form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 2 * 4 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
