Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of [20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 36 3-stars.

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
