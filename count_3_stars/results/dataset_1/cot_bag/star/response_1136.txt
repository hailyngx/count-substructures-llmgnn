Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 9.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>
