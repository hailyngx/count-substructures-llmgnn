Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's identify the 3-stars. 

Looking at each node:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, potential for 1 3-star
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors, potential for 1 3-star
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors, potential for 1 3-star
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, potential for 1 3-star
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, potential for 1 3-star

Hence, we have the following 3-stars:
- [4]
- [6]
- [7]
- [8]
- [9]

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars is 5, and the unique 3-stars are <4>, <6>, <7>, <8>, <9>.
