Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

For node 0: Node 0 has neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 0. 
<Node 0, (2, 5, 8)>

For node 1: Node 1 has neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 1. 
<Node 1, (2, 8, 9)>

For node 2: Node 2 has neighbors {0, 1, 8}. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 2. 
<Node 2, (0, 1, 8)>

For node 5: Node 5 has neighbors {0, 9}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 5.

For node 6: Node 6 has neighbors {0, 1}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 6.

For node 7: Node 7 has neighbors {1, 8}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 7.

For node 8: Node 8 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 8. 
<Node 8, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 9: Node 9 has neighbors {1, 5, 8}. Since it has more than 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star with node 9. 
<Node 9, (1, 5, 8)>

Putting the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.
