Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars and list them uniquely, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. We will follow the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each such node. 

Starting with each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (3, 5, 6, 7). It can form  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (1, 6, 8, 4). It can form  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (0, 2, 5, 7, 8). It can form  \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 4, 6). It can form  \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (1, 3, 5). It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 23 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23]. Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
