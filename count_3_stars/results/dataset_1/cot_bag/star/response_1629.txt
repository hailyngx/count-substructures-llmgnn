Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, we can analyze each node to determine if it can form a 3-star.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up gives a total of 20 3-stars, so the final answer is [20].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, and <8, (1, 7, 9)>.
