Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1 and node 9 (degree 4 and 6 respectively), we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) and \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars respectively.
- All other nodes have a degree less than 3, so they don't participate in forming 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 9) = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 1)>
<9, (3, 4, 0)>
<9, (9, 4, 3)>
