Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 27 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
