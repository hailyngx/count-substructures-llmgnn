Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 3

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. 

For Node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, and <6, (0, 2, 5)>.
