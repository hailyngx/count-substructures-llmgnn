Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4] = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 4)>
- <7, (5, 2, 9)>
- <7, (5, 2, 4)>
- <7, (5, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 1)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (3, 6, 1)>
- <7, (3, 6, 2)>
- <7, (3, 6, 4)>
