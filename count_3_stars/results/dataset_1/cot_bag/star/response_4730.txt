Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

Node 2 has neighbors: {3, 4, 9}
Node 4 has neighbors: {2, 5, 8}
Node 6 has neighbors: {0, 1, 8, 9}
Node 8 has neighbors: {4, 6, 7}
Node 9 has neighbors: {2, 6, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>
