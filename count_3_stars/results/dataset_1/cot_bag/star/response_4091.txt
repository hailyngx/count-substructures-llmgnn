Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with their respective neighbors are given below:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 4, 7

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
We have the following unique 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>

Node 4 also has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>.
