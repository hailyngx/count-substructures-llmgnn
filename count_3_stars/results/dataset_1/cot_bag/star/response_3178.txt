Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and connections:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 = 8. Hence, we have [8] 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (8, 9, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 0)>, <5, (0, 8, 3)>.
