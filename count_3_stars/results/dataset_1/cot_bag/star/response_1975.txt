Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$
- Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 3: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 5: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 9: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 9, 6)>
