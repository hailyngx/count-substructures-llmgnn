Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors first:

- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Checking each node, we see that nodes 3, 4, and 9 each have at least 3 neighbors, so they have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 9)>.
