Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first write down the neighbors of each node:

- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [1]

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (8, 1, 9)>
<8, (4, 1, 7)>
