Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Since all the above nodes have 3 or more neighbors, we need to add up all the 3-star counts:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
