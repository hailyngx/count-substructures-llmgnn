Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can see that the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors. 

- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \). 

So, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
