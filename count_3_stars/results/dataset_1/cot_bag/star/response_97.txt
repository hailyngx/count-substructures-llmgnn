Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 109 3-stars.  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [109].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 2, 8)>, 
<1, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<3, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<6, (3, 7, 8)>.
