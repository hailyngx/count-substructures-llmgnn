Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, each node with three or more neighbors can potentially form 3-star structures. Let's identify those nodes and calculate the number of 3-stars for each.  

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3 -> 3-stars: [1]
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8 -> 3-stars: [1]
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7 -> 3-stars: [2]
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 9 -> 3-stars: [1]
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7 -> 3-stars: [2]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2] = [7]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [7].
