Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections are as follows:
        
        - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
        - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
        - Node 2 is connected to node 6.
        - Node 3 is connected to node 4.
        - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
        - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
        - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
        - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
        
For node 0, inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars can be formed.
For node 1, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star can be formed.
For node 7, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star can be formed.
For node 8, inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 0, 6)>
