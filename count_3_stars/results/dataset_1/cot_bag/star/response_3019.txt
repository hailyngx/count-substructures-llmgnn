Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Once we have those nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 1, 4, 8, 7, and 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 34 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
