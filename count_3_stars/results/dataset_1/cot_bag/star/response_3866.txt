Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {2, 5}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 4, 7 have 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (as it only has 2 neighbors)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 3-star from node 2)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 3-star from node 4)
- For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (as it only has 2 neighbors)

So, total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
