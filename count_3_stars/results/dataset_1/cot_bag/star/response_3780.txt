Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 6, 9
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 10 3-stars.
Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<6, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
