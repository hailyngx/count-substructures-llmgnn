Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors, as these nodes have the potential to form 3-stars.

1. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, and 0. This node can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 7)>
