Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, and 8.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, and 7.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.
Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with its neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
