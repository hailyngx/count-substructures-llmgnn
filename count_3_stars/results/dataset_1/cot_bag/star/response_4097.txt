Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Let's examine each node:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4, 9
Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 6
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 9
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 6
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [11]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 0)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 1, 5)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
