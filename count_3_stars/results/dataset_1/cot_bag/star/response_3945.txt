Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 4] = [24] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 5, 7)>
