Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 40 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
