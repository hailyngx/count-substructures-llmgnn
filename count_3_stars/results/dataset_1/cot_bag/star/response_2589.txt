Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 4, 8
- Node 4: neighbors 1, 5
- Node 5: neighbors 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 8)>
<4, (1, 5)>
<5, (4, 8)>
