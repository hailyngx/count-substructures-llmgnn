Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

4. Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

6. Node 8 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 35 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 35 = 76 \)

Hence, the answer is: [76]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>.
