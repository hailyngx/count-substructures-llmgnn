Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars from all nodes, we have a total of 16 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
