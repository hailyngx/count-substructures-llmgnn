Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 and Node 6 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 7 and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Summing up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
