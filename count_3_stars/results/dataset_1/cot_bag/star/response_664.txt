Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 3 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 2 3-stars: <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 3 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in this graph.
