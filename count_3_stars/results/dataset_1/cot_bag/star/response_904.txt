Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Looking at the list of edges, we can determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 7 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 3, and 7 each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5, 6, and 8 do not have more than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 does not have 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
