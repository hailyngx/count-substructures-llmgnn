Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first create a list of the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate how many 3-stars can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are 27 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, and <6, (4, 7, 9)>.

Putting the final count inside brackets: [27]
