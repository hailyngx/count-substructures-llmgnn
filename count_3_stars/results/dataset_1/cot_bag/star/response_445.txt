Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, hence we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, hence we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, hence we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, hence we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, hence we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, hence we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 27 \) 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [27].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
