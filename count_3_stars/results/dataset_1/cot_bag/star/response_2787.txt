Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 24 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
