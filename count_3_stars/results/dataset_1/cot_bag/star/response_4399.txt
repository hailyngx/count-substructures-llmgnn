Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
With 10 nodes and 26 edges, the graph can be illustrated as follows:

    - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
    - Edges: 
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 1
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9
    - Node 5 is connected to node 2
    - Node 6 is connected to node 8
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4 and 6
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7

Based on the degree of each node, the potential 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

- For nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
  - Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 1] = [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>
