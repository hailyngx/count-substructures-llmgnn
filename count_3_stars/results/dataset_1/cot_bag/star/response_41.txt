Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, and 5. So, it can form 1 3-star.
    - <2, (3, 5, 5)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, and 6. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
    - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (5, 2, 6)>
    - <3, (5, 2, 6)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
    - <5, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <5, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
    - <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. Putting this in brackets, we have [10].
