Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. 

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5. So, it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star. <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9. So, it can form 4 3-stars. <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6. So, it can form 4 3-stars. <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8. So, it can form 4 3-stars. <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 15. 

So, the final answer is [15].
