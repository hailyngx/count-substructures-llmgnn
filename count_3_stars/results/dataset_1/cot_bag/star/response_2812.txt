Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4] = 39.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
