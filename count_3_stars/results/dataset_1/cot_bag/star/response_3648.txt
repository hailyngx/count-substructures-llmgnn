Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 7, and node 8.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>

There are a total of 12 3-stars ([]).
