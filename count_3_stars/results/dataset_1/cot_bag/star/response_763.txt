Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For the other nodes:
- Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 2)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 7)>.
