Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and their connections are provided through the edges mentioned. 

The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {6, 7}
Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {3, 9}
Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
Node 4: {1, 5, 7}
Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
Node 6: {0, 3, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

Node 0: No 3-star formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 2: No 3-star formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 4: No 3-star formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
Node 5: No 3-star formed as it has only 2 neighbors.
Node 6: No 3-star formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 8: No 3-star formed as it has only 3 neighbors.
Node 9: No 3-star formed as it has only 5 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 8)>, <7, (3, 1, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 1, 9)>
