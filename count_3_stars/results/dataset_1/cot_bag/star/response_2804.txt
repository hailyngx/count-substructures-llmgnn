Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 9) = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>
