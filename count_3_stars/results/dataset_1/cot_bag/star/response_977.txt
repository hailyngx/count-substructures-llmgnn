Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 9).
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8).
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8).

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Since each of these nodes only contributes 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4. 

Therefore, the answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
