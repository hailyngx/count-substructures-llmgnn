Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
