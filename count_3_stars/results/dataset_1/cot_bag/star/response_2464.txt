Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the nodes and connections are as follows: 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star with it.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star with it.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star with it.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1] = [3].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>.
