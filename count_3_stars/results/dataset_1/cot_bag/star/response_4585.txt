Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
  
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, 
  <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <4, (5, 8, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 9, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, 
  <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 3)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from the above calculations:
4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 8) = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [ 28 ].
