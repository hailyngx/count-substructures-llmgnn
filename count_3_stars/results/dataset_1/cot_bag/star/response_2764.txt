Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will analyze each node to determine if it forms any 3-stars.

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Forms 3-stars with nodes (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 5), and (2, 3, 5). So [3].
  
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7. Forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 7), and (0, 4, 7). So [3].
  
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7. Forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 5, 7). So [1].
  
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1. Forms 1 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 5). So [1].
  
- Node 4: Connected to node 1. No 3-stars.
  
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2. No 3-stars.
  
- Node 6: Connected to node 7. No 3-stars.
  
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6. Forms 3-stars with nodes (1, 2, 4) and (1, 2, 6). So [2].
  
- Node 8: Connected to node 0. No 3-stars.
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2] = [10].
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2, 5>
<0, 1, 3, 5>
<0, 2, 3, 5>
<1, 0, 3, 4>
<1, 0, 3, 7>
<1, 0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 6>
<1, 2, 6>
