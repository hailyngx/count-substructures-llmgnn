Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 (degree 5)
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 8 (degree 4)
Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 9 (degree 4)
Node 3: 1, 2, 4 (degree 3)
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3 (degree 4)
Node 5: 6, 7 (degree 2)
Node 6: 2, 5, 9 (degree 3)
Node 7: 0, 5 (degree 2)
Node 8: 0, 1 (degree 2)
Node 9: 0, 2, 6 (degree 3)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
