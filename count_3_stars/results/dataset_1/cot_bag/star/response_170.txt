Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To begin, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes have the potential to form 3-stars. From the given edges, we see that nodes 4, 6, 7, 9 each have three or more neighbors. 

Let's start by calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 6 3-stars:
\[ [6] \]
And the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
