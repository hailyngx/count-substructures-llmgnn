Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 2, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 5, 7}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Summing up, there are 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 49 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 7, 9)>
