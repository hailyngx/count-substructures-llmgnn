Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to determine the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 6, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 7
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors 1, 2
- Node 8 has neighbors 2, 3, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-star (as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2

So, the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
