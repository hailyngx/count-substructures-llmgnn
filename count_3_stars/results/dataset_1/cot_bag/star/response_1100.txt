Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6. Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8. Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9. Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6. Therefore, it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
