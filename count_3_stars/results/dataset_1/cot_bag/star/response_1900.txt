Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 2: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
Node 3: Forms 1 3-star <3, (1, 7, 8)>
Node 4: Forms 1 3-star <4, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 5: Forms 1 3-star <5, (1, 2, 6)>
Node 6: Forms 1 3-star <6, (0, 1, 5)>
Node 7: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
Node 8: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-stars formed (has 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1] and the unique 3-star found is <1, (3, 5, 6)>.
