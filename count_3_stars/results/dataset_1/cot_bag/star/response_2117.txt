Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 35 + 1 = 56 \)

So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
