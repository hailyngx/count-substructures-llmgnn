Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 2, 3
Node 2: 1, 9
Node 3: 1, 4, 7
Node 4: 3, 6, 8
Node 5: 0, 9
Node 6: 4, 9
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4, 9
Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, 7: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 6, 8: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, 6: <9, (2, 5, 6)>
Node 9 also forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 8, 5: <9, (2, 8, 5)>
Node 9 again forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 8, 5: <9, (6, 8, 5)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. So, the final answer is [5].
