Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 forms four 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
