Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\)  (As it has only 2 neighbors)  
For node 1: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  (The 3-stars are <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 3)>)  
For node 2: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\)  (As it has only 2 neighbors)  
For node 3: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  (The 3-stars are <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>)  
For node 4: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  (The 3-stars are <4, (2, 3, 6)>,  <4, (3, 6, 7)>,  <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 2, 7)>)  
For node 5: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\)  (As it has only 2 neighbors)  
For node 6: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\)  (As it has only 2 neighbors)  
For node 8: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) (The 3-stars are <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 6)>,  <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (6, 4, 7)>)  
For node 9: \({{1}\choose{3}} = 0\)  (As it has only 1 neighbor)  

Summing up the number of 3-stars:  
4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 8) = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:   
<1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>,  
<3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>,  
<4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>,  
<8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 6)>,  
<8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>,  
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
