Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 12.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
