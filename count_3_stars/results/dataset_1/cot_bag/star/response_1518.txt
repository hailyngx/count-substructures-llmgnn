Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now we apply the formula inom{n}{3} to each of these nodes:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
