Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 2: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
