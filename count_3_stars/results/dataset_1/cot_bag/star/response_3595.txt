Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 3, 9
- Node 2: neighbors 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: neighbors 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: neighbors 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: neighbors 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: neighbors 1, 5, 7, 8

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
