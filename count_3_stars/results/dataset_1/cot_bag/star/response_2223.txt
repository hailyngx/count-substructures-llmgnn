Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,7), (1,8), (2,0), (3,4), (3,7), (3,8), (4,3), (4,6), (5,7), (6,4), (6,9), (7,1), (7,3), (7,5), (8,1), (8,3), (9,6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (1, 2) which is less than 3. So, no 3-star is formed with node 0.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8) which is 3 or more. So, we can form 1 3-star with node 1.
- Total 3-stars for node 1: [1]

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (0) which is less than 3. So, no 3-star is formed with node 2.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8) which is 3. So, we can form 1 3-star with node 3.
- Total 3-stars for node 3: [1]

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (3, 6) which is less than 3. So, no 3-star is formed with node 4.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (7) which is less than 3. So, no 3-star is formed with node 5.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (4, 9) which is less than 3. So, no 3-star is formed with node 6.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5) which is 3 or more. So, we can form 1 3-star with node 7.
- Total 3-stars for node 7: [1]

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (1, 3) which is less than 3. So, no 3-star is formed with node 8.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (6) which is less than 3. So, no 3-star is formed with node 9.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
