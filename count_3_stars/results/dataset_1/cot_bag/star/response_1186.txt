Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors
Node 2 has 3 neighbors
Node 3 has 3 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 4 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 1
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
