Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Adding these up: 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 54.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>.
