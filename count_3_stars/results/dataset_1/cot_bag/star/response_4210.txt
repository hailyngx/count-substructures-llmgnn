Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first examine each node to see if it has three or more neighbors. 

From the given edges, the degree of each node is as follows:
- Node 0: 7 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 35 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 56, so the answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
