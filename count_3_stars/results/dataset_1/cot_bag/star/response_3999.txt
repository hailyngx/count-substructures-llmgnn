Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: neighbors 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 7, 8
- Node 7: neighbors 6, 8
- Node 8: neighbors 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: neighbors 4, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 6 3-stars: [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
