Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8
- Node 4 is connected to node 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7
- Node 9 is connected to node 7

Based on the edges given, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
