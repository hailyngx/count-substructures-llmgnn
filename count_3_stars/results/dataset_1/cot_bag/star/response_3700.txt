Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges as described:

Nodes: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 6), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8)}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed in this graph by each eligible node:

1. Node 5 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8) and can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
   <5, (4, 7, 8)>

2. Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8, 9) and can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, 
   <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>

3. Node 8 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 9) and can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
   <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [1 + 10 + 1] = 12 3-stars.
