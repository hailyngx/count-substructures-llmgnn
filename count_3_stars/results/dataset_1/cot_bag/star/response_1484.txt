Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1
Node 5: 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 7
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
