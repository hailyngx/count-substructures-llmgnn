Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node that has three or more neighbors.

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
3. Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
