Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
By checking each node, we can determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes. Let's go node by node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Adding up the number of 3-stars from nodes 2 and 3, we get \( 20 + 35 = 55 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
