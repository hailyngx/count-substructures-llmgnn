Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. The nodes that meet this criteria are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9. 

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 9). Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

- Node 2: Node 2 has 2 neighbors (8, 9), which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

- Node 3: Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0, 6), which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

- Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5). Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

- Node 7: Node 7 has 2 neighbors (0, 8), which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

- Node 8: Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2, 7), which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.

- Node 9: Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2). Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 1)>.
