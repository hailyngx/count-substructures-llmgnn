Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
