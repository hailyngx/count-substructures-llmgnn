Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their neighbors are:
Node 0: 3, 4, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 9
Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 5: 2, 3, 8
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 3, 4, 5
Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
For node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = [4] = 4
For node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
For node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = [20] = 20
For node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = [10] = 10
For node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1
For node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 47

So, there are 47 3-stars in total in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 1, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 3)>
<2, (4, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 4, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (8, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 1, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 1)>
<4, (8, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
