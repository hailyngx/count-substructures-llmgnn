Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 2 other nodes connected to node 0. No 3-star is formed.
- Node 1: There are 2 other nodes connected to node 1. No 3-star is formed.
- Node 2: There are 2 other nodes connected to node 2. No 3-star is formed.
- Node 3: There are 2 other nodes connected to node 3. No 3-star is formed.
- Node 4: There are 3 other nodes connected to node 4. Only 1 3-star is formed: <4, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 5: There are 6 other nodes connected to node 5. We can form 3-stars with node 5 as the center as follows: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, and <5, (2, 4, 6)>.
- Node 6: There are 5 other nodes connected to node 6. We can form 3-stars with node 6 as the center as follows: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, and <6, (3, 4, 5)>.
- Node 8: There are 2 other nodes connected to node 8. No 3-star is formed.

Adding up the 3-stars identified, we have a total of [1 + 3 + 3 + 3] = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
