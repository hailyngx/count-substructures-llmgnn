Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. From the provided edge list, we notice the following:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (as there are 4 possible 3-stars)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 possible 3-star)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 possible 3-star)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 possible 3-star)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 \)

So, there are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. Listing them inside <> once, we get:
\[ [7] \]
\[ <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 2)>, <1, (3, 2, 9)>, <1, (4, 2, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)> \]
