Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 2, node 3, node 6, and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2, it has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, and 7. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars containing node 2.
These 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>

For node 3, it has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, and 9. There is only 1 3-star containing node 3:
<3, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 6, it has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars containing node 6.
These 3-stars are:
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 9, it has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 6. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars containing node 9.
These 3-stars are:
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Adding all the 3-stars together: \[ 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
