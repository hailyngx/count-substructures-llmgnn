Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes (0 to 8) with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7

We see that nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 0 (with neighbors 1, 2, 7):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 7)>

For node 2 (with neighbors 0, 4, 6, 7):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>

For node 7 (with neighbors 0, 2, 4, 8):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>

For node 8 (with neighbors 3, 7):
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
