Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 31 \)

Therefore, there are 31 3-stars in this graph. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 5], [0, 1, 7], [0, 1, 8], [0, 1, 9], [0, 2, 5], [0, 5, 6], [0, 5, 7], [0, 7, 6], [1, 4, 8], [1, 8, 3], [1, 8, 7], [1, 8, 9], [3, 6, 5], [3, 6, 7], [3, 6, 9], [7, 8, 9], [7, 9, 6], [7, 9, 8], [9, 1, 6]>
