Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The 3-stars can be counted as follows:

- Node 0 has neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6}, forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}, forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}, forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}, forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 6 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}, forming 2 3-stars. 

So the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 5, 8>
<1, 0, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 3, 6>
<5, 0, 1, 2>
<6, 0, 1, 3>
<6, 1, 4, 9>
