Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
