Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 9.  

For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4  
For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4  
For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4  
For node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10  
For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4  

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26  
So, there are 26 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the answer is [26].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 3, 6)>  
<0, (2, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<1, (3, 4, 8)>  
<1, (5, 7, 8)>  
<4, (6, 7, 9)>  
<5, (7, 9, 4)>  
<9, (4, 6, 5)>
