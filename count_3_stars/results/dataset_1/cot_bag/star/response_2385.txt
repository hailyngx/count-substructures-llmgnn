Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Following the method outlined earlier, we can calculate the 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Putting all of them together, we have a total of \(10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 26\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
