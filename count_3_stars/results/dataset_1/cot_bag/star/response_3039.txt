Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, we can determine the following neighbor counts for each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 2, 5)>
- <0, (4, 2, 8)>
- <0, (6, 0, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 4, 8)>
- <2, (5, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 4)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Putting this final count in brackets: [13].
