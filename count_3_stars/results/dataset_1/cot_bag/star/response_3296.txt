Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 1, 4, 6, and 9.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 2 3-stars: <0, (5, 9)> and <0, (5, 2)>.
2. Node 5 has 2 3-stars: <5, (0, 9)> and <5, (0, 2)>.
3. Node 1 has 1 3-star: <1, (4, 5)>.
4. Node 4 has 1 3-star: <4, (1, 5)>.
5. Node 6 has 0 3-stars.
6. Node 9 has 0 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (5, 9)>, <0, (5, 2)>, <5, (0, 9)>, <5, (0, 2)>, <1, (4, 5)>, and <4, (1, 5)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
