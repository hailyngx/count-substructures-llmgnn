Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the only nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. Based on the given edges, nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
  - Total 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
  - Total 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 8
  - Total 3-stars for node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 2
  - Total 3-stars for node 4: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) = 12.

Hence, the final answer is [12], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>.
