Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
   
        0-----5
        |     | 
        7--2--4
           | 
           1
      
        6--3--8
           | 
           9

Next, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 7.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, and 7.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: [0 3-stars] 
- For node 2: [1 3-star] 
- For node 4: [3 3-stars]
- For node 7: [6 3-stars]

Summing these up: [0 + 1 + 3 + 6] = [10]

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, represented as:
<0, (5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
