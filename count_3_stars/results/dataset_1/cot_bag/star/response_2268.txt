Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of those nodes. 

List of nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>
