Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's go through the nodes:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Only Node 3 has three or more neighbors, so we will focus on this node to count the 3-stars.

For Node 3, the possible combinations of 3 neighbors that form 3-stars are given by \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \[20 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20\].

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
