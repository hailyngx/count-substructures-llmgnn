Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the provided edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

There are a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 20 3-stars in the graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<7, (9, 0, 4)>
