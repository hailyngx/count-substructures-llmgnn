Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  0, 1, 4, 5, 7.

For node 0:
It has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 7), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 1:
It has 2 neighbors (0, 7), which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

For node 4:
It has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 5:
It has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 7:
It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 16 \).

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>.
