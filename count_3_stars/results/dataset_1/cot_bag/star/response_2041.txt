Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 0.
- Total 3-stars for node 0: [1]

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 5.
- Total 3-stars for node 5: [4]

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 6.
- Total 3-stars for node 6: [1]

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 7.
- Total 3-stars for node 7: [4]

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9. So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 8.
- Total 3-stars for node 8: [1]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1] + [4] + [1] + [4] + [1] = 11 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 11.

The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
