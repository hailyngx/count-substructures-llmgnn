Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 8.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9.
Therefore, the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
