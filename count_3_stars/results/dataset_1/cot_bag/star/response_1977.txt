Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

To find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 25

Thus, the final answer is [25], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
