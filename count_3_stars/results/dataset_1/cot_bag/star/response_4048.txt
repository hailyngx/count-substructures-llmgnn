Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 2  
Node 1: 0, 5, 9  
Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9  
Node 3: 7, 9  
Node 4: 5, 6  
Node 5: 1, 4, 7  
Node 6: 2, 4, 7  
Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9  
Node 8: 9  
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [1] 
- Node 1: [3]
- Node 2: [3]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [6]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [4]

Summing up all the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 19 3-stars: 

\[ [1 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 4] = [19] \]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 2> 
<1, 5, 9> 
<2, 6, 7> 
<3, 7, 9> 
<5, 4, 7> 
<7, 2, 9> 
<7, 3, 9> 
<7, 5, 9>
