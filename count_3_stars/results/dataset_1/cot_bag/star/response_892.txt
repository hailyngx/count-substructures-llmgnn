Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For node 0: It has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7). So, there are \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star. <0, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 1: It has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7). So, there are \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star. <1, (2, 3, 7)>

For node 2: It has 2 neighbors (0, 1). As it doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 3: It has 2 neighbors (1, 5). As it doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 4: It has 1 neighbor (0). As it doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 5: It has 2 neighbors (3, 9). As it doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 6: It has 1 neighbor (7). As it doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 7: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 8). So, there are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars. <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>

For node 8: It has 1 neighbor (7). As it doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 9: It has 1 neighbor (5). As it doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6. So, the answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>
