Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node and sum them up:

Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 can form 3 3-stars.
Node 5 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
