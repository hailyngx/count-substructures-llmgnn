Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

We can see that node 3 and node 5 have three or more neighbors, making them possible centers of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 11 3-stars, which we will put inside brackets: [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
