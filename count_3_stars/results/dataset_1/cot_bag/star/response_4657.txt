Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: {3}

Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 8}

Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 9}

Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}

Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}

Node 5: {2, 3, 4}

Node 6: {1, 2}

Node 7: {4, 9}

Node 8: {1, 3}

Node 9: {2, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>.
