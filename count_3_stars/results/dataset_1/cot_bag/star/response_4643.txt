Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9.  

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: In this case, there are 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars because it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: Similarly, there are 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars as it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: Here, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star because node 4 has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Node 6 also has 3 neighbors, so there is 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Node 8 also has 3 neighbors, resulting in 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 3-stars in total.  

So, the final answer is [8].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<4, (1, 2, 6)>  
<6, (4, 8, 1)>  
<8, (1, 6, 4)>  
<9, (3, 7, 4)>
