Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the graph to find nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9)
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7)
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 5: has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6)
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors (3, 5)
- Node 9: has 2 neighbors (0, 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 24 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final count is [24], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>,
<2, (3, 5, 7)>,
<3, (2, 5, 6)>,
<4, (0, 5, 7)>,
<5, (1, 2, 3)>,
<5, (2, 3, 4)>,
<5, (3, 4, 8)>,
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
