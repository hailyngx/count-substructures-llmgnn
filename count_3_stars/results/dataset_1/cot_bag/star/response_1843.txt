Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors
- Node 7: has 5 neighbors

For Node 2:
- Total 3-stars with Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

For Node 7:
- Total 3-stars with Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with Node 7: <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
