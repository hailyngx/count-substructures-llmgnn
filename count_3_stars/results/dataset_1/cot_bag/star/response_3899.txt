Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

So, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<0, (9, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 0, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
