Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To begin, let's visualize the graph based on the information given. 

The graph has 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
The edges in the graph are: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 7), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 9), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8). 

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 total 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (0, 8, 4)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>

Putting the final count inside brackets, we get: [9].
