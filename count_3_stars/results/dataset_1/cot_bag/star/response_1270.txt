Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
There are 5 neighbors of node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors of node 2: 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 5:
There are 5 neighbors of node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 6:
There are 5 neighbors of node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7.
Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 7:
There are 6 neighbors of node 7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 54 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>.
