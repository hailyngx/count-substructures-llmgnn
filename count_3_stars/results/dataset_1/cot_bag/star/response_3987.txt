Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:  
0: 3, 5, 7, 9  
1: 2, 3  
2: 1, 3, 7  
3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7  
4: 8  
5: 0, 3, 6  
6: 3, 5, 7, 8  
7: 0, 2, 3, 6  
8: 4, 6  
9: 0  

Let's determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 20 + 1 = 22 [22].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 2)>  
<3, (0, 1, 5)>  
<3, (0, 2, 7)>  
<3, (2, 1, 7)>  
<3, (5, 0, 6)>  
<3, (5, 6, 7)>  
<3, (6, 5, 7)>  
<3, (6, 7, 8)>  
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
