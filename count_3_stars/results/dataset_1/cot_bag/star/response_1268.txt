Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star can be formed with exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Only 1 3-star can be formed with exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star can be formed with exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [15] \]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 4, 2>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <1, 0, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <4, 0, 6>
- <5, 4, 8>
- <8, 1, 6>
- <8, 1, 5>
