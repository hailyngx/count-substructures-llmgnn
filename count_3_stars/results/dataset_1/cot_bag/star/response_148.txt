Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 4, 6  
Node 1: 2, 8, 9  
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8  
Node 3: 2, 6, 9  
Node 4: 0, 2  
Node 5: 9  
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7  
Node 7: 6  
Node 8: 1, 2  
Node 9: 1, 3, 5  

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph: 

For node 1: 1 3-star  
For node 2: 3 3-stars  
For node 3: 1 3-star  
For node 6: 4 3-stars  
For node 9: 1 3-star  

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<1, (2, 8, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 4)>  
<2, (1, 6, 8)>  
<2, (3, 4, 6)>  
<6, (0, 2, 3)>  
<6, (2, 3, 7)>  
<6, (3, 7, 9)>  
<6, (0, 4, 7)>  
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
