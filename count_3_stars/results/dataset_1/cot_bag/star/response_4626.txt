Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Node 0 has 3 neighbors
Node 1 has 5 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 3 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the formula we discussed earlier:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>

So, the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, and <9, (1, 7, 9)>.
