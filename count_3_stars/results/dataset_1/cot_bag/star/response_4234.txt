Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Looking at the edges provided, we can construct the following graph:
```
    1 --- 3
     \   /
      \ /
       2
       | \
       |  \
       4 --6 --9
        \ / \
         7   8
```

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
