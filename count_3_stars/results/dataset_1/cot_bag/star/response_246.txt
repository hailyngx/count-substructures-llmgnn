Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 3, 6, and 7.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors {3, 6, 7}. As it has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)>.

2. Node 3 has 4 neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}. As it has more than 3 neighbors, we calculate \( ùê∂(4,3) \) = 4, so there are 4 3-stars with 3 as the center: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>.

3. Since Node 6 also has 4 neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}, it forms 4 3-stars similarly to node 3: <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>.

4. Node 7 has 2 neighbors {0, 3}, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) = 9.
