Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Adding these up, we get a total of 18 3-stars: [18].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 4)>
<0, (6, 8, 5)>
<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (9, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 1)>
