Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the edges are:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 7.

Now, let's determine the unique 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
    - <0, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
    - <1, (0, 5, 7)>
    
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
    - <3, (0, 2, 8)>
    
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
    - <5, (0, 7, 8)>
    
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars. 
    - <7, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 8, 0)>
    - <7, (5, 8, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars is [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [23].
