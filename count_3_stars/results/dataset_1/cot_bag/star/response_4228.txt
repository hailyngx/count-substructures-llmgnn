Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 1:
- Neighbors: {0, 3, 5}
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>

For node 3:
- Neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13, and the unique 3-stars are:
<[1, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>]
