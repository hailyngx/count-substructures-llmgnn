Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, 7, and 9 (degree 4)
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 3, 5, and 9 (degree 4)
- Node 4 has neighbors 3, 7, and 9 (degree 3)
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, and 5 (degree 4)
- Node 9 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, and 6 (degree 4)

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [17] \).

Unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 4, 5)>

<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
