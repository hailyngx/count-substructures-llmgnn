Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 62.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 62.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].
