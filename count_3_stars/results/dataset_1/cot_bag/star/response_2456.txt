Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1---3
  /|\
 / | \
0  |  4
 \ | /|
  \|/ |
   2--5
  /|   \
 6-7    9
```

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 9, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] total 3-stars.
