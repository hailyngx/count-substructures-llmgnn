Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes can be connected as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star. <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star. <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star. <8, (3, 7, -)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
