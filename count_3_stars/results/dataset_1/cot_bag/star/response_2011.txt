Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
       0
     / | \
    2--3--7
   /|  |   |\
  4 6  5   1 9
```

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors which are nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7. 

For node 0, there are 3 possible combinations for 3-stars: {0, 2, 3}, {0, 3, 7}, {0, 2, 7}. 
For node 2, there are 4 possible combinations for 3-stars: {2, 0, 3}, {2, 0, 4}, {2, 0, 6}, {2, 0, 8}.
For node 3, there are 4 possible combinations for 3-stars: {3, 0, 1}, {3, 0, 5}, {3, 0, 8}, {3, 1, 5}.
For node 7, there are 3 possible combinations for 3-stars: {7, 0, 1}, {7, 0, 9}, {7, 1, 9}.

Adding these up, we have a total of 14 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [14]. 
And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
