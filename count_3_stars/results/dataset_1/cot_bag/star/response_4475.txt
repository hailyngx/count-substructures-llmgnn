Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: has 4 neighbors (3-stars formed: 4 choose 3 = 4)
    - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (3, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors (3-stars formed: 3 choose 3 = 1)
    - <2, (0, 3, 4)>

- Node 3: has 6 neighbors (3-stars formed: 6 choose 3 = 20)
    - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <3, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <3, (2, 4, 1)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (4, 5, 1)>

- Node 4: has 3 neighbors (3-stars formed: 3 choose 3 = 1)
    - <4, (2, 3, 5)>

- Node 6: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed

- Node 9: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 26. 
So, the total number of 3-stars for this graph is [26]. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 1)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 1)>, and <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
