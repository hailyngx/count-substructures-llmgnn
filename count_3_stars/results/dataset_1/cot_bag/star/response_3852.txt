Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10 \)

There are 10 3-stars in this graph, which can be listed as follows:
[<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>]
