Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edge list, we can see the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2 neighbors (7, 8)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9)
Node 2: 1 neighbor (6)
Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 4)
Node 4: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 9)
Node 5: 2 neighbors (4, 7)
Node 6: 2 neighbors (2, 7)
Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8)
Node 8: 2 neighbors (0, 7)
Node 9: 2 neighbors (1, 4)

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (6, 0, 8)>
