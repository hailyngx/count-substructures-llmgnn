Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 2, 6

Let's find the number of 3-stars: nodes with 3 or more neighbors.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 does not have enough neighbors
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3: [<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>].
So the final result is [3].
