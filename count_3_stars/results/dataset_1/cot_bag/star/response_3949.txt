Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 8).
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7).
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (5, 7).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (3, 4).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9).
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8, 9).
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (6, 7).

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 20

Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 8, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<(6, 7, 9)>
<(3, 4, 7)>
<(3, 7, 8)>
<(4, 5, 7)>
<(7, 8, 9)>
<(7, 6, 9)>
<(7, 4, 5)>
<(7, 4, 9)>
<(7, 6, 8)>
<(4, 5, 7)>
<(7, 8, 9)>
<(7, 4, 5)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [20].
