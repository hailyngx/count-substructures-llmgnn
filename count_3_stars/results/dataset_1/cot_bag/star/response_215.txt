Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

So, there are 8 3-stars in total, and they are: 
<[0, 1, 6], [0, 1, 4], [0, 1, 7], [0, 4, 6], [0, 4, 7], [1, 3, 6], [3, 2, 8], [4, 6, 9]>
