Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's list the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor

Now, we focus on nodes with three or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars:
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors (insufficient)
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors (insufficient)
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors (insufficient)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph, which means the total number of 3-stars is 0. 
So, the final answer is [0].
