Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:  
0: 5, 8, 9  
2: 3, 7, 8  
3: 2  
4: 7  
5: 0, 6, 9  
6: 5, 7  
7: 2, 4, 6  
8: 0, 2  
9: 0, 5  

Let's now identify the 3-stars in this graph:  
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 8, and 9.  
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 7, and 8.  
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 6, and 9.  
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star with nodes 5 and 7 (since 6 only has 2 neighbors).  
- Node 7 also forms 1 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6.  
Considering these, we have a total of [3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 11 3-stars.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 8, 9)>  
<2, (3, 7, 8)>  
<5, (0, 6, 9)>  
<6, (5, 7)>  
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
