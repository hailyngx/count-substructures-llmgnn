Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. From the given edge list, we can construct the following node adjacency list:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 3
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <2, (0, 1, 9)>

- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>

- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
  <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (6, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 4, 3)>

- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>

- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <8, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 25. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (6, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 4, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>.
