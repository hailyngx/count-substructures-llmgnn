Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph as follows:

```
   0       1 - 2       3
    \       \ /         |
     \       5          9
      \     / \       /
        7 - 6   4     8
```

We can now count the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 9. 
   - Number of 3-stars with Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>

2. Node 7 has 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8.
   - Number of 3-stars with Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
   - 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, 
              <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>,
              <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>,
              <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>,
              <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>,
              <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>,
              <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 35 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].
