Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, and <8, (5, 9, 1)>.
