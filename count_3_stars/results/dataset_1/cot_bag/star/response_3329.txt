Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: Node 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: Node 2, 7, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: Node 0, 1, 5, and 8. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, 6, and 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, 7, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, 2, and 6. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: Node 3, 5, and 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, 4, 6, and 8. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: Node 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, 3, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

\( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
