Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: {(0, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)}

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 2: Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (8, 9, 5)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (8, 9, 7)>
- <2, (9, 7, 5)>
- <2, (9, 8, 5)>
- <2, (7, 9, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
