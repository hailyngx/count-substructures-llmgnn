Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors for node 0: 2, 6, and 9.
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
So, there is 1 3-star with center node 0.

For node 1:
There are 4 neighbors for node 1: 3, 5, 8, and 9.
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
So, there are 4 3-stars with center node 1.

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors for node 5: 1, 4, 8, and 9.
Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} \), we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
So, there are 4 3-stars with center node 5.

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 5) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
