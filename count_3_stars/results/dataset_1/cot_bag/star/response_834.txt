Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 
  <0, (1, 4, 5)> 
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 
  <1, (0, 5, 7)> 
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 
  <4, (0, 5, 9)> 
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 
  <5, (0, 1, 4)> 
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 
  <8, (1, 2, 6)> 
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 
  <9, (0, 1, 4)> 

Summing these up, we get a total of [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [42].
