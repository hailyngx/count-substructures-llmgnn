Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 1
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 5
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 3

Identifying the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
