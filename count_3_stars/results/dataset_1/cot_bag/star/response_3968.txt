Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the given edges in the graph are:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 3 and Node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 3 and Node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, and Node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 3 and Node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 2 and Node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 6.

Let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>.

The total number of 3-stars is [4].
