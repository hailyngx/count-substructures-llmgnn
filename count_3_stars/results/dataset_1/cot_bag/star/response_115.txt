Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 6}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {6}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 8}

Now, calculating the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 4)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 1)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>
