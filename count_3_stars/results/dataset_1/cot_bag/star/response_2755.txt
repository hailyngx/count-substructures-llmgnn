Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: 
There are 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5). So the number of 3-stars involving node 3 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 4: 
There are 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6, 8). So the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 5: 
There are 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 7). So the number of 3-stars involving node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 8: 
There are 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 9). So the number of 3-stars involving node 8 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 9)>
