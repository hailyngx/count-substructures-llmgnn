Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
For Node 7: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
For Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (9, 7, 6)>
