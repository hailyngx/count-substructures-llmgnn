Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the neighbors of each node to identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: Neighbors - 3, 5, 9 (3 neighbors)
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - Total 3-stars: [1]

2. Node 2: Neighbors - 4, 6 (2 neighbors)

3. Node 3: Neighbors - 1, 5, 7 (3 neighbors)
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - Total 3-stars: [2]

4. Node 4: Neighbors - 2, 7 (2 neighbors)

5. Node 5: Neighbors - 1, 3 (2 neighbors)

6. Node 6: Neighbors - 2, 9 (2 neighbors)

7. Node 7: Neighbors - 3, 4 (2 neighbors)

8. Node 8: Neighbors - 9 (1 neighbor)

9. Node 9: Neighbors - 1, 6, 8 (3 neighbors)
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - Total 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and they are: 
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
