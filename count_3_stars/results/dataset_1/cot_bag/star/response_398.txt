Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 4] = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
