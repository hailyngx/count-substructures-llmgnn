Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

Node 0 cannot form any 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 1 <1, (8, 9, 1)>.
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 2 <2, (7, 6, 2)>.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4 <4, (1, 2, 4)>.
Node 6 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 0, 2, and 6 <6, (0, 2, 6)>, and another with nodes 3, 7, and 6 <6, (3, 7, 6)>.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9 <9, (1, 3, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
