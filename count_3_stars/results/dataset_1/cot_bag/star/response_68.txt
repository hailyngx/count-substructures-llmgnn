Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7). Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 8, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (0, 2), which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 8, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7). Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7). Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 18. Therefore, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>
