Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges: 

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Edges: (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 4)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8), so it forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 8), so it forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, and <8, (3, 4, 6)>.
