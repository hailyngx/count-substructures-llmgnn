Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: There are 2 choices for the first neighbor, and then 1 choice for the second neighbor, giving a total of 2 3-stars. 
- For node 2: There are 4 choices for the first neighbor, 3 choices for the second neighbor, giving a total of 4 3-stars. 
- For node 4: There are 4 choices for the first neighbor, 3 choices for the second neighbor, giving a total of 4 3-stars. 
- For node 5: There are 4 choices for the first neighbor, 3 choices for the second neighbor, giving a total of 4 3-stars.
- For node 7: There are 3 choices for the first neighbor, 2 choices for the second neighbor, giving a total of 3 3-stars.
- For node 8: There are 4 choices for the first neighbor, 3 choices for the second neighbor, giving a total of 4 3-stars.
- For node 9: There are 4 choices for the first neighbor, 3 choices for the second neighbor, giving a total of 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4] = [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>
