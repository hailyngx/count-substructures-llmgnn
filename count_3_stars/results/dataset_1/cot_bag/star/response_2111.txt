Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0,3), (1,4), (2,7), (3,0), (3,8), (4,1), (4,5), (5,4), (6,7), (6,8), (7,2), (7,6), (7,9), (8,3), (8,6), (9,7)

Based on the edge list, the neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, thus it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found is: <7, (2, 6, 9)>
