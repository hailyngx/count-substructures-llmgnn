Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as pairs of nodes. Let's construct the graph first.

The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph based on the given criteria.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
