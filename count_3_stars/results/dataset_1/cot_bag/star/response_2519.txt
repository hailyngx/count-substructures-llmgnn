Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's analyze each node to determine which ones have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Degree = 2
Node 1: Degree = 2
Node 2: Degree = 4
Node 3: Degree = 3
Node 4: Degree = 3
Node 6: Degree = 2
Node 7: Degree = 1
Node 8: Degree = 3
Node 9: Degree = 1

Only nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8 have three or more neighbors, therefore, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (7, 9, 8)>
