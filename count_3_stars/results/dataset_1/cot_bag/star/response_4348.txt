Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 5 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is:
There are [5] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
