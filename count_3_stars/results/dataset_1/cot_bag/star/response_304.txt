Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we examine each node that has three or more neighbors. We apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to count the number of 3-stars at each node.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star at node 1

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star at node 2

Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars at node 3

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star at node 5

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars at node 7

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star at node 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [18] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>
