Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors as these are the potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
