Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can analyze the nodes and their neighbors to find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6. Thus, from node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. 
The 3-stars from node 0 are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6. It forms 1 3-star.
The 3-star from node 2 is:
<2, (0, 3, 6)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6. It forms 1 3-star.
The 3-star from node 3 is:
<3, (0, 2, 6)>

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5. Since it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 4. It doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3. Since it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9. It forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
The 3-star from node 1 is:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 9. Thus, from node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed. 
The 3-stars from node 7 are:
<7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>

Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 7. It doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 7. It doesn't form any 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 12 3-stars. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
