Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph and identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Nodes 1 and 6 have three or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars (since it has 6 neighbors)

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (since it has 4 neighbors)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 20 + 4 = 24 \)

Hence, there are 24 3-stars in this graph.
Putting it in brackets: [24]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
