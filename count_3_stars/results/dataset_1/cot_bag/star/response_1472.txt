Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \(4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13\).

So, the final answer inside brackets is [13].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<0, (5, 2, 8)>, 
<0, (4, 1, 8)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<6, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
