Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 0, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 6)>, <3, (8, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 1)>, <6, (1, 7, 4)>, <7, (1, 8, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 1)>.
