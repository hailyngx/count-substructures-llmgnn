Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph visually:
      
```

                     1
                     |
                     0
                    /|\
                   8 3 7
                     /|\
                    9 2 5
                      |
                      4
                      |
                      6
```

We see that node 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7 each have at least 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>.
