Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

From this list, we see that only nodes 4 and 9 have three or more neighbors and can form 3-stars. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
