Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 24 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>.
