Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
For this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these together, we have a total of 14 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [14].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (8, 9, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
