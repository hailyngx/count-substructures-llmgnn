Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 1
<1, (0, 2, 6)>

Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: 1
<2, (1, 4, 5)>

Node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: 4
<3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 1
<4, (2, 3, 8)>

Node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
- No 3-star can be formed with node 6 as the center.

Node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>

Adding all the 3-stars found: [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [15]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.
