Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:
- For node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0  (since it has only 2 neighbors)
- For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1  (only 1 3-star)
- For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1  (only 1 3-star)
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 8: inom{5}{3}= 10
- For node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 27

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 0, 1)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<10, (3, 5, 9)>
<11, (3, 5, 8)>
<12, (3, 5, 9)>
<13, (3, 8, 9)>
<14, (3, 8, 5)>
<15, (3, 9, 5)>
<16, (6, 0, 1)>
<17, (6, 2, 7)>
<18, (6, 2, 8)>
<19, (6, 3, 1)>
<20, (6, 3, 8)>
<21, (6, 3, 9)>
<22, (8, 2, 7)>
<23, (8, 2, 6)>
<24, (8, 3, 5)>
<25, (8, 3, 6)>

<27, (8, 3, 6)>
