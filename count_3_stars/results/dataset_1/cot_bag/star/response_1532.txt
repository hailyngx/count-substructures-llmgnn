Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list them below:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 6 (2 neighbors)

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes mentioned above:

- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node: 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
