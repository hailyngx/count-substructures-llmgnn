Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3 also has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

So there are a total of 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
