Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
Node 0: 2, 3, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 6
Node 4: 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 6
Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2
Node 8: 4, 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 can form 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, 9.
Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, 7, 9.
Node 2 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 5, 7.
Node 3 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 6.
Node 6 can form 3-stars with nodes 3, 5, 8, 9.
Node 9 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 4, 6.

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4, 6)>
