Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following neighbors:
   - Node 0: 3, 4, 5
   - Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 2: 1, 3
   - Node 3: 0, 2
   - Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 9
   - Node 5: 0, 1, 4
   - Node 7: 1, 8
   - Node 8: 7
   - Node 9: 4

Following the process outlined earlier:
For node 0 (with 3 neighbors), there is 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
For node 1 (with 4 neighbors), there are 1 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
For node 4 (with 4 neighbors), there is 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is [3].
