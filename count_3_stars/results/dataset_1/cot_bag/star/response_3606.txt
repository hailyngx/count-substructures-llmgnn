Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \sum_{v \text{ with degree} \geq 3} \binom{d_v}{3} \]

Using the provided edge list, we can calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25 \]

Hence, there are 25 3-stars in this graph.

Putting this in brackets: [25]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
