Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 9
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 7
Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 2
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 8
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 9
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 9 each have exactly 2 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star. 
- Node 2, Node 6, and Node 7 have exactly 2 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star. 
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star. 

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph.

The total number of 3-stars is [0].
