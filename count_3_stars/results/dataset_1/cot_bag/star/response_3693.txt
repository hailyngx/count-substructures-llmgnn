Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
For node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 20 + 4] = 25.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
