Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 12 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (6, 0, 9)>
- <4, (6, 2, 9)>
- <4, (6, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 9)>
