Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 8
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed with node 0 as the center
- So, for node 0: [1]

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 7
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed with node 1 as the center
- So, for node 1: [1]

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars are formed with node 4 as the center
- So, for node 4: [20]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [1 + 1 + 20] = [22]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
