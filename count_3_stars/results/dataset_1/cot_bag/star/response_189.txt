Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
