Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, for the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 38

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 3, 9>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 1, 5>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 3, 6>
