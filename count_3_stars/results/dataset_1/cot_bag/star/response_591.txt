Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors. From the given edges, the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Nodes 0, 3, and 5 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars using these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
