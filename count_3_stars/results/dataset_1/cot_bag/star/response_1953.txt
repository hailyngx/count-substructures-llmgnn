Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
We start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the eligible nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 16 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 

<1, (1, 9, 0)>
<2, (2, 1, 9)>
<2, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (2, 6, 3)>
<3, (3, 1, 9)>
<6, (6, 2, 7)>
<6, (6, 3, 7)>
<6, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (6, 7, 2)>
<7, (7, 2, 6)>
<7, (7, 3, 6)>
<7, (7, 6, 8)>
<7, (7, 6, 2)>
<8, (8, 0, 6)>
<9, (9, 0, 1)>  

So, the final answer is: The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
