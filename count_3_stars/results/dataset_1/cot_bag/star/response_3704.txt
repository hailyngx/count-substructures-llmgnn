Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's see the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- Node 6: There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 9: There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 1 + 1] = 12 \).

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>.
