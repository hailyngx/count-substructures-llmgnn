Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
Node 0 (neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 8)  
Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 4, 6)  
Node 2 (neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8)  
Node 3 (neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9)  
Node 4 (neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6)  
Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 4, 7)  
Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 1, 4)  
Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9)  
Node 8 (neighbors: 0, 2, 3)  
Node 9 (neighbors: 3, 7)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21

Putting this final number inside brackets: [21]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
