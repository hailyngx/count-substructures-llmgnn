Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 3. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 8. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 8, 9. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 9. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7. It forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 5)>.
