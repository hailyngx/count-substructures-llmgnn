Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: 
\[ \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\} \]

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are potential centers of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
  <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>

- For node 6: 1 3-star forms <6, (1, 5, 8)>

- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, 
  <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 9)>, <8, (8, 9, 9)>

- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, 
  <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 29 3-stars in this graph.
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].
