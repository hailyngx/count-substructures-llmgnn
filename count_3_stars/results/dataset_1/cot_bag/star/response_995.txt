Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0 and node 8. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 8 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 4] = 5.
