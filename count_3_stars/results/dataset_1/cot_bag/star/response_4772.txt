Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star that can be formed.
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed.
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed.
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star that can be formed.
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star that can be formed.
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed.
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed.
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars can be formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 15 \). Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
