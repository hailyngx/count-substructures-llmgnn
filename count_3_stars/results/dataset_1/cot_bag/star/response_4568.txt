Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 16

Therefore, there are a total of 16 3-stars in the graph, and we can list them as follows: 
<[0, 1, 3]>, <[1, 0, 2]>, <[2, 1, 6]>, <[6, 2, 8]>, <[6, 7, 9]>, <[7, 6, 8]>, <[8, 1, 2]>, <[9, 4, 5]>. 

So the final answer is [16].
