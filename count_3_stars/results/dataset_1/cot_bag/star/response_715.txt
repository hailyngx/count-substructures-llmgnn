Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (4 and 9).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, and 9).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, and 7).
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (1 and 5).
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (0 and 2).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (1 and 3).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (7 and 8).
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (2 and 6).
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (6 and 9).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, and 8).

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Now, let's list these unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 0)>
