Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 5

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 0, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
