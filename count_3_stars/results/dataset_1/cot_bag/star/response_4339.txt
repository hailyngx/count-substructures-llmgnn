Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

From the given list of edges, we can see that the following nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 6, 9)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 7, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
