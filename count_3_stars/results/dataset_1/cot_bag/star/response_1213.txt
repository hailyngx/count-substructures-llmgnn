Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: node 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. For node 0: 
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

2. For node 3:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

3. For node 4:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

4. For node 5:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

5. For node 6:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

6. For node 8:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

7. For node 9:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars: 
\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 25 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
