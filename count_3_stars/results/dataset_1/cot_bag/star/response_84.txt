Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph can be visualized as follows:
```
       1 --- 4
      /|     |
     3 |     |
    /  |     |
   2   8 --- 7
    \     \ /
     \     0
      \   / \
       9 6   5
```
Let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
