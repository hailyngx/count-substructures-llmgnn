Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0:
- Total neighbors = 3
- Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1

For Node 1:
- Total neighbors = 3
- Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1

For Node 2:
- Total neighbors = 3
- Number of 3-stars = C(3, 3) = 1

For Node 8:
- Total neighbors = 5
- Number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

For Node 9:
- Total neighbors = 5
- Number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node:
1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 23, which we represent as [23]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
