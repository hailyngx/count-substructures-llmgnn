Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 0, 1)>, <6, (7, 4, 9)>
