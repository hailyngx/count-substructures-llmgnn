Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 1, 8)

- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 6, 7)

- Node 2: 1 3-star (2, 6, 7)

- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 5, 8)

- Node 5: 1 3-star (5, 4, 6)

- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 1, 7)

- Node 7: 1 3-star (7, 1, 9)

- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 0, 4)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 4, 6>
<6, 1, 7>
<7, 1, 9>
<8, 0, 4>
