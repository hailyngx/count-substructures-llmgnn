Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 4). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), and (2, 6). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 0), (3, 7), and (3, 9). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 0), (4, 5), and (4, 9). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (5, 2), (5, 4), and (5, 6). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 2), (6, 5), and (6, 7). So, it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 0)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>.
