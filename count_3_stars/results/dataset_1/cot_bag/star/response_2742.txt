Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the following graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges:
```
    0 --- 2 --- 1 
    |     |     |
    9 --- 7 --- 8
            |
            3 --- 6
            |     |
            5 --- 4  
                  |
                  9
```
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we examine each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: <9, (0, 1, 7)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars are: <<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>>.
