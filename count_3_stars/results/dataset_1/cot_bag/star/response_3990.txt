Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 9), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars using \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star
- Node 2: Only 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final result is [14] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 9, 7)>
