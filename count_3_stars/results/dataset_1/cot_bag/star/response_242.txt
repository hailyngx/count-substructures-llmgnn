Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8),
(1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 9),
(2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8),
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9),
(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8),
(5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 9),
(6, 0),
(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8),
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9),
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors but we also take into account edge (3, 3), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (8, 7, 2)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <7, (5, 8, 4)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 2, 4)>

Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
These 3-stars are: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 52 3-stars found in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
