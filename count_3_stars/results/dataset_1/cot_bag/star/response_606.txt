Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 \) [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
