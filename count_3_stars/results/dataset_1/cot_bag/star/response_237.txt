Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
   1 --- 3 --- 4 --- 6
   |     |     |     |
   0     5     2     8
          |           |
          6           7
          |           
          8           
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8
  - Total 3-stars using node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6
  - Total 3-stars using node 1: 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 6)>

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
  - No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4
  - No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
  - Total 3-stars using node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 6)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
  - Total 3-stars using node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8
  - Total 3-stars using node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>

- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 8
  - No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7
  - Total 3-stars using node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 2
  - No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 13.

Thus, the answer is: [13]
