Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.
- Node 9 is connected to node 5.

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: There are three neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 1: There are four neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: There are four neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 5) = 9 3-stars

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 2>
<5, 2, 4>
<5, 2, 8>
<5, 2, 9>
<5, 3, 1>
<5, 9, 8>
