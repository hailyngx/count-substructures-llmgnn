Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, 
  <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since it has only two neighbors)

- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since it has only two neighbors)

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>,
  <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <9, (0, 7, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 1 = 25

So, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>,
<1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>,
<7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>,
<7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>,
<9, (0, 7, 1)>
