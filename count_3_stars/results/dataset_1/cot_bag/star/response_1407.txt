Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
       0 ---- 2 ---- 3 ---- 6 ---- 5
       |      |      |      |      |
       8 ---- 4      7      9      |
               |      |             |
               --------            
```

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 3, 4, 7, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 5, 6, 9, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
