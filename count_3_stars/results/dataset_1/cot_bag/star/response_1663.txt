Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
1---5       7---9
 \ /         \ /
  3           2
  |
  2
 / \
4---8
|
5
```

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by applying the formula explained earlier. 

For each node with three or more neighbors, we'll compute the number of 3-stars and sum them up:

Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9 has 2 neighbors (4, 7), which is less than 3, so no 3-star

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3, which we represent as [3].

The unique 3-stars are: 
1. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
2. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
3. <8, (4, 5, 9)>
