Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

```plaintext
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5),(2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (8, 5), (9, 0)
```

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8 (degree = 5) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 (degree = 5) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 8 (degree = 3) => 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the answer is [21] and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 2, 5)>, <1, (5, 2, 4)>, <1, (5, 2, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (8, 1, 5)>, <1, (8, 5, 2)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 1, 5)>, <2, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 2, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 1)>, <2, (7, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 1, 8)>, <5, (2, 5, 1)>, <5, (8, 1, 2)>
