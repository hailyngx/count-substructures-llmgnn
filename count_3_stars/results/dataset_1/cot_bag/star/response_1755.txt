Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 9)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 9)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 4.
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

There are a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
