Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, and Node 0 has 2 neighbors. They cannot form any 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
