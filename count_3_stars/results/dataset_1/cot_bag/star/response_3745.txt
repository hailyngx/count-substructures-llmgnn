Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
