Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the criteria mentioned earlier:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 6: <1, (5, 8, 6)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6: <8, (0, 5, 6)>

Thus, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
