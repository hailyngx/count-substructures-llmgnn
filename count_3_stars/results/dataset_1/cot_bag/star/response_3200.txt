Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 6, 7 and 0 stars with 9. 
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 7, 8.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with nodes 8.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star with nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with nodes 0 and 1 and 2 3-stars with nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with nodes 1, 2.
  
Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we have: 
\[ [4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1] = [14]. \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8)>
- <4, (8)>
- <5, (1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1)> and <7, (6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2)>
