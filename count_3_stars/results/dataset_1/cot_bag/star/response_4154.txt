Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To start, let's analyze the nodes in the graph to see which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 7)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (5, 7)

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors and then sum them up:

- For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there is 1 3-star.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7, there is 1 3-star.
- For node 8, there is 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 19 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 19 and we list them inside <>: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
