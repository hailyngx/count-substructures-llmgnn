Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 45 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 9, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 1)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 2, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>
