Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the provided edges, the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1----3
  /|  /| \
 / | / |  \
0--2--7---9
|  |   \  |
|  |    \ |
4--5-----8
```

Now we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
4. Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6]. \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)> \]
