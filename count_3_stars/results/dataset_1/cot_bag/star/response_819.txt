Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: neighbors 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: neighbors 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: neighbors 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: neighbors 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: neighbors 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: neighbors 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: neighbors 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 2, 4, 5, 7

Considering the nodes with three or more neighbors for 3-star formation, we find the following:
- For Node 0, we have 1 unique 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- For Node 2, we have 1 unique 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- For Node 4, we have 1 unique 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- For Node 9, we have 1 unique 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
