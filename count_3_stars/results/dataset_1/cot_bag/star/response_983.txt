Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6, which is written as [6].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (2, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
