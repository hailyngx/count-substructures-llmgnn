Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's go through each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

For node 0: Node 0 has only 1 neighbor. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 1: Node 1 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 8, 4). So, we can form \( ^4C_3 = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 4)>, <1, (4, 8, 4)>, <1, (6, 8, 4)>

For node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9). So, we can form \( ^3C_3 = 1 \) 3-star. 
<2, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 3: Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 8, 9). So, we can form \( ^5C_3 = 10 \) 3-stars.
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 4: Node 4 has only 1 neighbor. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 5: Node 5 has only 1 neighbor. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 6: Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 1). So, we can form \( ^4C_3 = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 1)>, <6, (1, 3, 1)>, <6, (2, 3, 1)>

For node 7: Node 7 has only 1 neighbor. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9). So, we can form \( ^3C_3 = 1 \) 3-star.
<8, (1, 3, 9)>

For node 9: Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8). So, we can form \( ^3C_3 = 1 \) 3-star. 
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 4)>, 
<1, (4, 8, 4)>, 
<1, (6, 8, 4)>, 
<2, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 1)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 1)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 1)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
