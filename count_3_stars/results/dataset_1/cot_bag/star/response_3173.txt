Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 1), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4 (degree = 3)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 8 (degree = 2)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1 (degree = 2)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6 (degree = 3)

Apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
