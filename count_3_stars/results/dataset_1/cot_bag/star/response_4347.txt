Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding them up: \(4+10+20+10+4 = 48\)

Thus, there are 48 3-stars in the given graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:

- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
