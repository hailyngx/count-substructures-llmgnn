Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
```
    0 -- 6
   /|\
  7 8 1
 /     \
9       4
         |
         3
         |
         2
```

Now we check each node to see how many neighbors it has:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
