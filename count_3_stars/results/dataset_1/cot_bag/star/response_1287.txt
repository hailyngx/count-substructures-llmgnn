Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 9)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (Nodes 5, 9)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (Nodes 4, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 6)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (Nodes 2, 7)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (Nodes 3, 5)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (Node 4)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 5, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 2, 8)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they each contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 and Node 8 each contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 0)>
