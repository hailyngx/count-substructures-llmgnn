Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

Following the construction method explained in the initial statement, we analyze each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
