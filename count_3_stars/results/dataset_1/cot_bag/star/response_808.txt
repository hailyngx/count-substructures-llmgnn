Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors (degree \( \geq 3 \)). These nodes are: 0, 3, 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

So, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
