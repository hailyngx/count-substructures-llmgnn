Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
Node 5: Since it has only 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star

Total 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 5)>, <3, (4, 8, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
