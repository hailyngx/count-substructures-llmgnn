Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32, so the answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
