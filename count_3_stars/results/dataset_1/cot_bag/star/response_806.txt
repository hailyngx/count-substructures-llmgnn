Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Unique 3-stars with node 1 are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Unique 3-stars with node 3 are: <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Unique 3-stars with node 5 are: <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \), so the final result is [12].
Unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>
