Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 with 3 neighbors
- Node 1 with 3 neighbors
- Node 2 with 5 neighbors
- Node 3 with 5 neighbors
- Node 4 with 4 neighbors
- Node 6 with 4 neighbors
- Node 7 with 4 neighbors
- Node 8 with 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (total = 1)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (total = 2)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars (total = 12)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars (total = 22)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (total = 26)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (total = 30)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (total = 34)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (total = 38)

There are a total of 38 3-stars in the graph.
