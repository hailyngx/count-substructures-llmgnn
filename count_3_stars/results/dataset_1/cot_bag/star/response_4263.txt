Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

Based on the criteria mentioned earlier, we find:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is\[ 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 \]
