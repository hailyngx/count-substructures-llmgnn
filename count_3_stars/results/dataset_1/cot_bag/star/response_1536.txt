Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 1

We can see that nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up, we get a total of \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
