Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 6. 
- From node 2, we can form 1 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 6)>.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, and 9. 
- From node 3, we can form 1 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 9)>.

Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 1, and 8. 
- From node 6, we can form 2 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 8)> and <6, (1, 2, 8)>.

Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, and 6. 
- From node 8, we can form 2 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 6)> and <8, (3, 6, 6)>.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 2 + 2] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (1, 6, 6)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, and <8, (3, 4, 6)>. 

So, the final answer is: [6].
