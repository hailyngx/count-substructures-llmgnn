Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
