Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Only nodes 5 and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 = 14.

The unique 3-stars are:
<[5], (2, 4, 6)>, <[5], (4, 6, 7)>, <[5], (6, 7, 9)>, <[5], (6, 8, 9)>, <[6], (4, 5, 7)>, <[6], (5, 7, 9)>, <[6], (5, 8, 9)>, <[6], (7, 8, 9)>, <[6], (7, 8, 9)>, <[6], (7, 8, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].
