Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17 \) 3-stars.
So, the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
