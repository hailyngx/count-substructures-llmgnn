Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here is the list of nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 7

From the list above, nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9 have at least three neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

For node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 1)>
