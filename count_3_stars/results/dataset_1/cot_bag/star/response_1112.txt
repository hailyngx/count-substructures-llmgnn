Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
