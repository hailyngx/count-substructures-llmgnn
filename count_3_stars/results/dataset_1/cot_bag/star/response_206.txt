Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with more than 3 neighbors:   
Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7   
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7   
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5   
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9   
Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 7, 8   

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 14 \)  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 14.  
Putting this number inside brackets, we get: \[14\]  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<4, (2, 3, 7)>  
<4, (2, 6, 7)>  
<4, (3, 6, 7)>  
<4, (6, 5, 7)>  
<5, (0, 1, 7)>  

And each of these 3-stars represents only one combination.
