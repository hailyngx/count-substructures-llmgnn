Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 9), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 9), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 8), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 8), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes: 
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
