Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are unique 3-stars in this graph:

[10]

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
