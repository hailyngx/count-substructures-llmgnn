Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3

Nodes 0, 3, and 6 have 4 neighbors each, indicating the potential for 3-stars. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 0:
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For Node 3:
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For Node 6:
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these together, we get a total of \( [4 + 4 + 1] = 9 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 4)>
- <0, (6, 4, 7)>
- <0, (8, 1, 3)>
- <3, (1, 8, 0)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
