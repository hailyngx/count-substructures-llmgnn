Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

```
   0 -- 1 -- 4 -- 8
   |    |    |    
   2 -- 3 -- 7 -- 9
        |    |
        5 -- 6
```

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 10 + 10 = 55

Therefore, the final answer is [55] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 4)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>, <1, (4, 0, 8)>, <1, (8, 0, 4)>, <1, (8, 4, 0)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 2)>, <1, (2, 0, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 0)>, <1, (3, 0, 2)>, <1, (3, 2, 0)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 9, 7)>, <1, (7, 0, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 0)>, <1, (9, 0, 7)>, <1, (9, 7, 0)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>, <3, (4, 1, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 1)>, <3, (8, 1, 4)>, <3, (8, 4, 1)>, <3, (1, 2, 0)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (2, 1, 0)>, <3, (2, 0, 1)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 1)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 9, 7)>, <3, (7, 1, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 1)>, <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <3, (9, 7, 1)>, <7, (1, 8, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (8, 1, 4)>, <7, (8, 4, 1)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 1)>, <7, (1, 5, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (5, 1, 3)>, <7, (5, 3, 1)>, <7, (3, 1, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 1)>
