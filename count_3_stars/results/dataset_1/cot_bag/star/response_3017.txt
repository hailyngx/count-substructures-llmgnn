Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes in total in the graph, but since node 0 only has 5 neighbors, 0 does not participate in creating any 3-stars. 

Node 1 has only 1 neighbor, so it also does not participate in forming any 3-stars.

Node 8 and node 9 both have only 2 neighbors each, so they do not participate in forming any 3-stars as well.

Therefore, we only need to consider nodes 2-7.

For node 2: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 4)>.

For node 3: There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars formed.

For node 4: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 2)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 0)>.

For node 5: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 7)>.

For node 6: There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 2)>, <6, (0, 7, 2)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 0)>, <6, (2, 7, 0)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (7, 4, 9)>.

For node 7: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have \( 4 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 45 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [45] \).
