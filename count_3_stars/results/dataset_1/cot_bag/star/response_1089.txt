Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives us a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 0, 9)>, <5, (6, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 0)>, <8, (2, 6, 5)>, <8, (3, 0, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 0)>, <8, (4, 0, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 3)>
