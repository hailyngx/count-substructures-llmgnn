Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph.

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 8), (3, 1), (4, 6), (5, 9), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors, less than 3.
- Node 2: has 1 neighbor, less than 3.
- Node 3: has 1 neighbor, less than 3.
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors, less than 3.
- Node 5: has 1 neighbor, less than 3.
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors (4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors, less than 3.
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors, less than 3.
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.

The 3-stars are:
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 9, 0)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
