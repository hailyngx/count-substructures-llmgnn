Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors first. Based on the edges provided, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars, so we add 2.
- Node 1 has 1 3-star, so we add 1.
- Node 2 has 1 3-star, so we add 1.
- Node 3 has 1 3-star, so we add 1.
- Node 4 has 2 3-stars, so we add 2.
- Node 8 has 5 3-stars, so we add 5.
- Node 9 has 2 3-stars, so we add 2.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 2] = [14]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<0, (7, 8, 4)>
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 0)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 0, 1)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<8, (6, 0, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 2, 6)>
