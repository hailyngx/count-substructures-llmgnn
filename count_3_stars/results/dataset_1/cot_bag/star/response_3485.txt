Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify which nodes have at least three neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 8, 9)>
