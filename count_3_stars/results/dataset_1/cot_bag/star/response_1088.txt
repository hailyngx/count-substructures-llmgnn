Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with that node.

Looking at the given information, nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. Total 3-stars with node 0 as the center: 1

Node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars with node 3 as the center: 4

Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. Total 3-stars with node 8 as the center: 1

Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Total 3-stars with node 9 as the center: 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10, so the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (8, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
