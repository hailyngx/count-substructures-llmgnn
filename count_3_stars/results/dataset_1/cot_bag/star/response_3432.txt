Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Applying the method described earlier, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by nodes 0, 2, and 3, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 3-stars.   
Hence, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].   
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:   
<0, (1, 7, 8)>   
<2, (3, 7, 8)>   
<2, (3, 9, 2)>   
<2, (3, 6, 9)>   
<3, (2, 6, 9)>   
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
