Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

So, the number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
