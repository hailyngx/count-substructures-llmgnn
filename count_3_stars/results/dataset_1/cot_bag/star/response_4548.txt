Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges as described. 

The nodes are labeled 0 to 9, and the edges are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph by calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
