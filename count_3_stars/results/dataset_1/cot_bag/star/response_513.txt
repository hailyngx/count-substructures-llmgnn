Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together gives a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12 3-stars.

Thus, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
