Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 4)

Next, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 24

So, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
