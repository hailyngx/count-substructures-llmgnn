Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 1: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 6: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 7: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9 [9]

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>
