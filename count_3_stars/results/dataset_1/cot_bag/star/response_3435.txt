Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 5: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 8: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 9: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$

Total number of 3-stars: $4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 3, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 4, 9)>,
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 3)>, <4, (5, 2, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 2)>,
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 2, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 2)>, <5, (6, 2, 4)>,
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 1)>, <6, (7, 1, 5)>,
<7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 5, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 5)>, <7, (8, 5, 6)>,
<8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 4, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 6)>
