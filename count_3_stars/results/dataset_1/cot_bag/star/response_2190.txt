Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's analyze each node to see how many neighbors it has:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 9 each have 3 neighbors, so we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star for each.
- Node 6, Node 8 have 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars for each.

Total 3-stars: 1 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 9) = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>.
