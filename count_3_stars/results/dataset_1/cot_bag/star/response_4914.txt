Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 4
- Node 10: 

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors, we can find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [ 4 ].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 10)>
