Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
For Node 7: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
For Node 8: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
For Node 9: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

Adding these up: $1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19$

Thus, there are 19 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 6], [0, 3, 6], [7, 1, 5], [7, 1, 8], [7, 1, 9], [7, 5, 8], [7, 5, 9], [7, 8, 9], [8, 4, 7], [8, 4, 9], [8, 7, 9], [9, 3, 5], [9, 3, 7], [9, 3, 8], [9, 5, 7], [9, 5, 8], [9, 7, 8], [9, 7, 8]>
