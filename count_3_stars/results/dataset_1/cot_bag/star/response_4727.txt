Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, there will be one 3-star formed with that node.

Here's the breakdown for each node:

Node 0: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<Node 0, (3, 6, 8)>
<Node 0, (3, 6, 9)>
<Node 0, (3, 8, 9)>
<Node 0, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 1: has 4 neighbors -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
<Node 1, (5, 7, 8)>
<Node 1, (5, 7, 9)>
<Node 1, (5, 8, 9)>
<Node 1, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 3: has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<Node 3, (0, 4, 5)>
<Node 3, (0, 4, 8)>
<Node 3, (0, 4, 9)>
<Node 3, (0, 5, 8)>
<Node 3, (0, 5, 9)>
<Node 3, (4, 5, 8)>
<Node 3, (4, 5, 9)>
<Node 3, (4, 8, 9)>
<Node 3, (5, 8, 9)>
<Node 3, (8, 9, 6)>

Node 4: has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<Node 4, (2, 3, 5)>
<Node 4, (2, 3, 6)>
<Node 4, (2, 3, 8)>
<Node 4, (2, 5, 6)>
<Node 4, (2, 5, 8)>
<Node 4, (3, 5, 6)>
<Node 4, (3, 5, 8)>
<Node 4, (3, 6, 8)>
<Node 4, (5, 6, 8)>
<Node 4, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 5: has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<Node 5, (1, 2, 3)>
<Node 5, (1, 2, 4)>
<Node 5, (1, 2, 7)>
<Node 5, (1, 3, 4)>
<Node 5, (1, 3, 7)>
<Node 5, (2, 3, 4)>
<Node 5, (2, 3, 7)>
<Node 5, (2, 4, 7)>
<Node 5, (3, 4, 7)>
<Node 5, (4, 7, 6)>

Node 8: has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<Node 8, (0, 1, 2)>
<Node 8, (0, 1, 3)>
<Node 8, (0, 1, 9)>
<Node 8, (0, 2, 9)>
<Node 8, (0, 3, 9)>
<Node 8, (1, 2, 9)>
<Node 8, (1, 3, 9)>
<Node 8, (2, 3, 9)>
<Node 8, (9, 6, 7)>
<Node 8, (6, 7, 4)>

Node 9: has 5 neighbors -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
<Node 9, (0, 1, 3)>
<Node 9, (0, 1, 6)>
<Node 9, (0, 1, 8)>
<Node 9, (0, 3, 6)>
<Node 9, (0, 3, 8)>
<Node 9, (1, 3, 6)>
<Node 9, (1, 3, 8)>
<Node 9, (0, 6, 8)>
<Node 9, (3, 6, 8)>
<Node 9, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 48.

The list of unique 3-stars found in the graph is:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
