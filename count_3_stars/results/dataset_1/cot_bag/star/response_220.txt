Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 4

Following the process described in the instruction, we'll find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 0)>
<5, (3, 7, 1)>
