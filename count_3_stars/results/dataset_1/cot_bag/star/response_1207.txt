Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify which nodes are part of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 8, 9), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are: 
  <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 9), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
  <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8), so it forms one 3-star: 
  <5, (2, 4, 8)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9), so it forms one 3-star: 
  <6, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9), so it forms one 3-star: 
  <8, (2, 5, 9)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
  <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 15.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
