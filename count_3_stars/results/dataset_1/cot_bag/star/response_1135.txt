Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 5, 9 <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 3, 8 <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 8, 9 <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, 6 and another 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 8 <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
