Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the total number of 3-stars, we first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5}

Now, we apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the final calculation is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
