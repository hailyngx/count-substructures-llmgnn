Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [] (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [1] <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: [1] <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 3: [1] <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 4: [] (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: [] (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [] (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: [1] <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 8: [1] <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: [3] <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
