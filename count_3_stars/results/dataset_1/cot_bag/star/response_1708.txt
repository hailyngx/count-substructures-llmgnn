Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Edges: {(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 9), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)}

Now, let's list the nodes based on their degrees:

Nodes:
- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 5

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 9)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 8, 9)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 6, 9)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
