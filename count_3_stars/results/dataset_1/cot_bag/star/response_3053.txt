Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1: 
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>

Node 5:
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 6:
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Adding them up, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
