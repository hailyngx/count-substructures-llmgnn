Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 9}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 4, 7)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 4, 5)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 3 3-stars (0, 4, 7), (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 5)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (0, 4, 7)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 3 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 7)>
