Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 unique 3-stars formed by Node 0:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

For Node 2:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 unique 3-stars formed by Node 2:
<2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 9)>

For Node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 unique 3-stars formed by Node 5:
<5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>

For Node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 unique 3-stars formed by Node 6:
<6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 unique 3-stars formed by Node 9:
<9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes:
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
