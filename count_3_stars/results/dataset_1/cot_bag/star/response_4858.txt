Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

So, there are a total of 22 3-stars in this graph. Listing them uniquely:

[22]
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 3, 9)>
