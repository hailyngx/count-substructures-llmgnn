Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) with three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
- Number of 3-stars for node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars for node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 8.
- Number of 3-stars for node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars for node 3: <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 1.
- Number of 3-stars for node 4: 1.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 6, 8.
- Number of 3-stars for node 5: 0.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5.
- Number of 3-stars for node 6: 0.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8.
- Number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars for node 7: <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 3)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 9.
- Number of 3-stars for node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars for node 8: <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 = 23.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].
