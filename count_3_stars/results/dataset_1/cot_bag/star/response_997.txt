Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
There are 4 neighbors of node 0 (nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6).
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 2: 
There are 3 neighbors of node 2 (nodes 0, 1, and 6).
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 2 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 6: 
There are 4 neighbors of node 6 (nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8).
So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
Total = 4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
