Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 7
3. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
4. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
5. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3
6. Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
   - <0, (2, 4, 8)>

2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
   - <2, (0, 1, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
