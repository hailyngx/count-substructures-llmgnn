Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16
Thus, the final result is [16].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
