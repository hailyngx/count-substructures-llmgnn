Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the calculation for the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0: It has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.
For node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 1.
For node 2: It has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with node 2.
For node 3: It has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with node 3.
For node 4: It has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with node 4.
For node 6: It has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with node 6.
For node 7: It has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed with node 7.
For node 8: It has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars formed with node 8.
For node 9: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 4 + 1] = 25 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 9, 3)>
<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<1, (9, 0, 0)>
