Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 1: 0, 3, 9
Node 2: 4, 8
Node 3: 1, 8
Node 4: 0, 2
Node 5: 0, 7
Node 6: 0, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 5, 6
Node 8: 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 1: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 2: No 3-stars
Node 3: No 3-stars
Node 4: No 3-stars
Node 5: No 3-stars
Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 7: No 3-stars
Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 9: No 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 2, 8)>, <0, (4, 1, 6)>, <6, (7, 5, 0)>, <6, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (8, 2, 4)>, <6, (8, 3, 1)>, <8, (2, 4, 0)>, <8, (2, 3, 1)>, <8, (6, 7, 5)>, <8, (6, 9, 1)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>
