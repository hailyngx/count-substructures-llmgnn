Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars and calculate the total number: 
Node 0: [1] = <>0, (4, 5, 7)<>
Node 1: [3] = <>1, (2, 5, 7)<> <>1, (5, 6, 8)<> <>1, (7, 6, 9)<>
Node 2: [3] = <>2, (1, 3, 6)<> <>2, (3, 6, 8)<> <>2, (6, 7, 1)<>
Node 3: []  (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: []  (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: []  (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: [1] = <>6, (3, 2, 8)<>
Node 7: [1] = <>7, (0, 1, 9)<>
Node 8: []  (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: []  (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
