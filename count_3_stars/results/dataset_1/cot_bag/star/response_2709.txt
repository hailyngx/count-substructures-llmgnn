Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph by listing all nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 4
Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6
Node 5: 4, 6, 8
Node 6: 4, 5
Node 7: 0, 2
Node 8: 5
Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9, so the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 7, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
