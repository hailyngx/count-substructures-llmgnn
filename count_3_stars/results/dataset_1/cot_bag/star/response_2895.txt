Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 6
         |    |    |
         4 -- 3    9
              |    |
              5    7 -- 8
``` 

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 2)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
