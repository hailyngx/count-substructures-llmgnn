Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: inom{â€Œ2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing these up: 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (6, 5, 9)>, <5, (7, 5, 9)>, <5, (8, 5, 9)>, <5, (9, 5, 6)>, <5, (9, 5, 7)>, <5, (9, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 9, 3)>, <9, (3, 9, 5)>, <9, (5, 9, 6)>, <9, (5, 9, 7)>, <9, (5, 9, 8)>, <9, (6, 9, 5)>, <9, (7, 9, 5)>, <9, (8, 9, 5)>.
