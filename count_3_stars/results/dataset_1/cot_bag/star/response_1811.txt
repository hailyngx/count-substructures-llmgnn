Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8. 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8 <1, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7 and 9 <2, (7, 9)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8 <6, (1, 7, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6 <8, (3, 4, 6)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6 and 8 <9, (6, 8)>.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \binom{10}{3} = 120 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
