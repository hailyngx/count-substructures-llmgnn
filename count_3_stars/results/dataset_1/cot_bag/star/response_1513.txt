Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}.

Node 0 has neighbors: {3, 5}.
Node 1 has neighbors: {3, 4, 8, 9}.
Node 2 has neighbors: {5, 8}.
Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 9}.
Node 4 has neighbors: {1, 5}.
Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4}.
Node 7 has neighbors: {8, 9}.
Node 8 has neighbors: {1, 2, 7, 9}.
Node 9 has neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 8}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing them up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, there are [20] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 8)>.
