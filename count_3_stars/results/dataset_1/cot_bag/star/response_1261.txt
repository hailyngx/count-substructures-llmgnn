Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 6, node 8, node 9, and node 3.
Applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

Unique 3-stars: 
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [22].
