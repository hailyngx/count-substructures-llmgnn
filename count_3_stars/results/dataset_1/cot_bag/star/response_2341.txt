Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To analyze the graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars: node 0, node 1, node 4, node 7, and node 8. 

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 23 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (3, 9, 6)>
- <7, (0, 8, 3)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 9, 2)>
- <4, (9, 6, 0)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 0, 9)>
- <1, (2, 9, 6)>
- <8, (1, 0, 2)>
- <4, (9, 0, 3)>
- <7, (3, 8, 0)>
- <7, (8, 0, 3)>

Putting the final number inside brackets, we have: [23].
