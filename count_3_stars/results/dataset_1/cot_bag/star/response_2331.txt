Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <0, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <1, (0, 4, 7)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <2, (0, 8, 9)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (7, 1, 5)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <5, (3, 4, 7)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5, 6), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>

Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 8), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = 18 3-stars.
