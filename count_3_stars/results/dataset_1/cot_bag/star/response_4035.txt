Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 27 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 1)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 3)>, <8, (0, 7, 1)>, <8, (0, 9, 2)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>, <8, (3, 7, 1)>, <8, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (7, 0, 1)>, <8, (7, 1, 0)>, <8, (9, 0, 2)>, <8, (9, 2, 0)>, <9, (1, 0, 8)>, <9, (2, 0, 8)>, <9, (8, 0, 2)>
