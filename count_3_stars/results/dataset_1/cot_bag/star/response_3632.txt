Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 8), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6. <9, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9. <8, (4, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, so the final answer is [4].
