Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3-stars: [<2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>]
- Node 3, 3-stars: [<3, (4, 5, 8)>]
- Node 4, 3-stars: [<4, (6, 7, 8)>]
- Node 5, 3-stars: []
- Node 7, 3-stars: []
- Node 8, 3-stars: [<8, (1, 3, 7)>]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
