Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Since this graph has 10 nodes and the total degree is 30 (sum of all degrees of nodes, which is twice the number of edges), we can see that the average degree is 6 for this graph.

Let's identify the nodes with degrees at least 3, as these are the only nodes capable of forming 3-stars.

Nodes with degrees at least 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up gives us \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24 \) 3-stars in total.

So, the final result is [24].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
