Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Using the formula mentioned earlier, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around the nodes with more than 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 34 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars are {<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>}.
