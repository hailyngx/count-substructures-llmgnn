Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes have the following numbers of neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 29

Therefore, there are 29 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:
\[ [29] \]
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>
