Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>.
