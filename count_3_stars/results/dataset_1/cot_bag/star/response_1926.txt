Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the neighborhoods of each node:
- Node 0: {8}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   (one 3-star with (6, 3, 8))
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  (two 3-stars with (8, 0, 2), (8, 3, 6) and six 3-stars with (8, 6, 9))
- For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 0 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <6, (3, 8)>, <8, (0, 2)> and <8, (3, 6)>.
