Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine how many neighbors each node has:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the information provided:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 0 = 16 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 9, 7)>, <1, (7, 9, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 0)>, <7, (1, 5, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 1)>, <7, (1, 0, 3)>, <7, (5, 3, 1)>, <7, (5, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>
