Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Now, we will find the 3-star configurations. Since each node must be the center of exactly one 3-star, we will check nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 0 has neighbors 2 and 6. It forms 1 3-star.  
2. Node 2 has neighbors 0 and 8. It forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 4 has neighbors 5 and 6. It forms 1 3-star.
4. Node 5 has neighbors 4 and 8. It forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 6 has neighbors 0, 4, and 7. It forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 7 has neighbors 6, 8, and 9. It forms 1 3-star.
7. Node 8 has neighbors 2, 5, and 7. It forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 3-stars in this graph, and the unique 3-star configurations are:
<[0, 2, 6], [2, 0, 8], [4, 5, 6], [5, 4, 8], [6, 0, 4], [7, 6, 8], [8, 2, 7]>. 

So, the final answer is [7].
