Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 30 3-stars. So, the final result is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<9, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 5)>,

<9, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (5, 7, 9)>.
