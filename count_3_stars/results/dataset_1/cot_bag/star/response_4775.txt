Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

Let's determine the total number of 3-stars first. We will analyze each node to see if it forms any 3-stars.

- Node 0 has neighbors 2 and 4, but it also has degree 2, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 1 has neighbors 3, forming a 3-star <1, (3, 1)>.

- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 5, and 7, allowing it to form 3-stars <2, (0, 5, 7)> and <2, (5, 7, 2)>.

- Node 3 has neighbors 1 and 7 but has degree 2, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 4 has neighbors 0 and 6, but its degree is 2, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 5 has neighbors 2, 6, and 8, allowing it to form 3-stars <5, (2, 6, 8)> and <5, (6, 8, 2)>.

- Node 6 has neighbors 4 and 5, but its degree is 2, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 7 has neighbors 2 and 3 but has degree 2, so it cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 8 has neighbors 5 and 7 but has degree 2, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2. 
Hence, the answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <1, (3, 1)> and <2, (0, 5, 7)>.
