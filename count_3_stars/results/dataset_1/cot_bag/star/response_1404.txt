Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1 neighbor (not enough for a 3-star)
Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 4)>)
Node 3: 6 neighbors (3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>)
Node 4: 5 neighbors (3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 5)>)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 9)>)
Node 6: 3 neighbors (1 3-star: <6, (3, 7, 8)>)
Node 7: 2 neighbors (not enough for a 3-star)
Node 8: 4 neighbors (3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 4)>)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 5)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
