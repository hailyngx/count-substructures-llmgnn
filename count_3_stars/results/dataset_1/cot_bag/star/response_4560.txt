Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
    0 --- 8
    |     |
    8 --- 4 --- 2
    |     |
    1 --- 8 --- 7
    |     |
    4 --- 5
    |     |
    2 --- 8 --- 0
    |     |
    4     8 --- 1
          |     |
          7 --- 6
              |
              5 --- 9
```

Now let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0: 0 has 2 neighbors, can't form a 3-star.\
Node 1: 1 has 2 neighbors, can't form a 3-star.\
Node 2: 2 has 2 neighbors, can't form a 3-star.\
Node 3: 3 has 1 neighbor, can't form a 3-star.\
Node 4: 4 has neighbors {1, 2, 8}, can form a 3-star. There is 1 3-star with 4 as the center <4, (1, 2, 8)>.\
Node 5: 5 has neighbors {3, 6, 9}, can form a 3-star. There is 1 3-star with 5 as the center <5, (3, 6, 9)>.\
Node 6: 6 has 2 neighbors, can't form a 3-star.\
Node 7: 7 has 2 neighbors, can't form a 3-star.\
Node 8: 8 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}, can form 5 3-stars. There are 5 3-stars with 8 as the center: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>.\
Node 9: 9 has 1 neighbor, can't form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 5 (from node 8) = 7
So, there are 7 3-stars in total.  
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>.  
Therefore, the answer is [7].
