Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)> 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 9)> 
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 4)> 

The total number of 3-stars is [3].
