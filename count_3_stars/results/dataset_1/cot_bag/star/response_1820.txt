Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>
