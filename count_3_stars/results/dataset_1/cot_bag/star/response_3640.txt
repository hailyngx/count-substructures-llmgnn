Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So there are a total of \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
