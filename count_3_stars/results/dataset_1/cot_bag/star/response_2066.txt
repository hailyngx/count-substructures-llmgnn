Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 29 \), so the final answer is [29].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
