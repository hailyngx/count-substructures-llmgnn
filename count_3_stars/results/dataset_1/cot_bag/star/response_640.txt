Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

0: 1, 2
1: 0, 7, 9
2: 0, 8
3: 4
4: 3, 7
5: 6, 7
6: 5, 7, 8
7: 1, 4, 5, 6
8: 2, 6, 9
9: 1, 8

Using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors, we find:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = [2].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 7)> and <6, (5, 8, 7)>.
