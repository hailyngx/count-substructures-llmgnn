Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and evaluate how many 3-stars can be formed around each of them. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and itself. So, we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars around node 1.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9. So, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 2.
- Nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 each have only 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \). 
So, the final count is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found can be represented as:
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
