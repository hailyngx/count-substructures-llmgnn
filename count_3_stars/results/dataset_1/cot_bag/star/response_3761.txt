Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's map out the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 5
- Node 1 is connected to Node 6
- Node 2 is connected to Node 7, Node 9
- Node 3 is connected to Node 5, Node 8, Node 9
- Node 5 is connected to Node 0, Node 3, Node 6, Node 9
- Node 6 is connected to Node 1, Node 5, Node 9
- Node 7 is connected to Node 2
- Node 8 is connected to Node 3
- Node 9 is connected to Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6

Now, we will identify the central nodes of the 3-stars, which are nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each central node:

- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \([1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [10]\) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (5, 9, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
