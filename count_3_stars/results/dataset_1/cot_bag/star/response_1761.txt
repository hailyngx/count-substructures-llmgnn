Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 8, 4)>
- <1, (3, 9, 4)>
- <1, (4, 9, 5)>
- <1, (9, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 8, 1)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 2, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 4)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 5, 4)>
- <9, (3, 1, 4)>
- <9, (4, 1, 5)>
