Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6)
Node 2 has 2 neighbors
Node 3 has 2 neighbors
Node 4 has 1 neighbor
Node 5 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 9)
Node 6 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 1 neighbor
Node 8 has 2 neighbors
Node 9 has 1 neighbor

For the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors (1, 5), let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10] = 11.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
