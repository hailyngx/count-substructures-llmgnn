Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 6
Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 2 neighbors
Node 3 has 1 neighbor
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, and 9
Node 6 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, and 9
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, and 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 7

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21

So, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
