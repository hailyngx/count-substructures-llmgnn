Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node and determine if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, and 7. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 8. This forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars:
<7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 20 = 24 3-stars in this graph.
The final answer is [24].
