Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 9)>

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 1, 7
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 1
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 0
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 7)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 0, 2
- Number of 3-stars: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, and <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
