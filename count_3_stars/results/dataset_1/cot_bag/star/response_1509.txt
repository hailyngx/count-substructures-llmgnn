Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can form 3-stars.

After examining the given edges, we find the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Nodes 2, 3, and 5 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>
