Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
Unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>.
