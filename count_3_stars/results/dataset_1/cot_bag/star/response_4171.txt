Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8), forming 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 8, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8, 9), forming 2 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6), forming 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6), forming 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6), forming 1 3-star.

In total, there are 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 3-stars in the graph, which gives us the final count as [8].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
