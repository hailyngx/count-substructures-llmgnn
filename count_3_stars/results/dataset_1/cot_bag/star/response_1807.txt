Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2)

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 9 (1 3-star)
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9 (1 3-star)
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (cannot form a 3-star)
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7 (1 3-star)
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 8 has 2 neighbors (cannot form a 3-star)
Node 9 has 2 neighbors (cannot form a 3-star)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[\binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10\]

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. Putting this number inside brackets, we get [10].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
