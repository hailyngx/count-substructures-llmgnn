Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 6)}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9 -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

So, the final answer is [16].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
