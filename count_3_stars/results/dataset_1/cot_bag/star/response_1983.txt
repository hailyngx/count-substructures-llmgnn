Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors so we can count the 3-stars formed around them.
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
