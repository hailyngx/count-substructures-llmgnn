Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will identify the 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>

So, the final answer is [6].
