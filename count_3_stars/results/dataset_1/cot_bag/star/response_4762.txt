Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the adjacency list representation of the graph is as follows:

Node 0: [2, 5, 7, 9]
Node 1: [7, 8]
Node 2: [0, 5]
Node 3: [6, 8, 9]
Node 5: [0, 2, 8]
Node 6: [3, 8]
Node 7: [0, 1]
Node 8: [1, 3, 5, 6, 9]
Node 9: [0, 3, 8]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 0. 
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with Node 1. 
3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with Node 2.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 3.
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 5.
6. Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with Node 6.
7. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with Node 7.
8. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 8.
9. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with Node 9.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
