Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, the nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.
Let's determine the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6) and can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
   <0, (1, 2, 6)>

2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 6, 8) and can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
   <1, (0, 3, 5)>
   <1, (0, 3, 6)>
   <1, (0, 3, 8)>
   <1, (0, 5, 6)>
   <1, (0, 5, 8)>
   <1, (0, 6, 8)>
   <1, (3, 5, 6)>
   <1, (3, 5, 8)>
   <1, (3, 6, 8)>
   <1, (5, 6, 8)>

3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9) and can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
   <2, (0, 3, 9)>

4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 8) and can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
   <3, (1, 2, 6)>
   <3, (1, 2, 8)>
   <3, (1, 6, 8)>
   <3, (2, 6, 8)>

5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8) and can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
   <5, (1, 4, 8)>

6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 3) and can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
   <6, (0, 1, 3)>

7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 9) and can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
   <8, (1, 2, 5)>
   <8, (1, 2, 9)>
   <8, (1, 5, 9)>
   <8, (2, 5, 9)>

8. Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 1) and can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
   <9, (2, 8, 1)>

Add the total number of unique 3-stars found: [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [23].
