Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look at each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes, where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that node.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
- For node 2 (3 neighbors), \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 4 (4 neighbors), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7 (4 neighbors), \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8 (3 neighbors), \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding them up, we have a total of 10 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>.
