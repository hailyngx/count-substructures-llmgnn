Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10  
For node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0  
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1  
For node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0  
For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4  
For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4  
For node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0  

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 19  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 3, 5)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<0, (8, 1, 4)>
<0, (9, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 0, 7)>
<5, (3, 0, 7)>
<5, (7, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
