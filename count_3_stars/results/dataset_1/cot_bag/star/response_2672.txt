Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges using the given edge connections:

0 --- 2
|\   /| 
| \ / |
|  9  |
| / \ |
|/   \|
3 --- 5
|     |
|     |
4     7
      |
      8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has neighbors 2, 3, 4, and 9 (4 neighbors), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has neighbors 0 and 9 (2 neighbors), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 5, 7, and 9 (4 neighbors), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has neighbors 0 (1 neighbor), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has neighbors 3, 7, 8, and 9 (4 neighbors), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has neighbors 3 and 5 (2 neighbors), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has neighbor 5 (1 neighbor), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, and 5 (4 neighbors), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16].

The unique 3-stars are: <>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
