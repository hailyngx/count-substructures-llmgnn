Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 8)>
    
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <4, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <4, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <7, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <7, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (2, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <9, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <9, (2, 4, 9)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <9, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 9)>

Adding up all the 3-stars gives us a total of 38.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
