Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes. 

Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- Unique 3-star 1: <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- Unique 3-star 2: <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- Unique 3-star 3: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- Unique 3-star 4: <3, (6, 9, 7)>
- Unique 3-star 5: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- Unique 3-star 6: <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- Unique 3-star 7: <9, (5, 6, 7)>
