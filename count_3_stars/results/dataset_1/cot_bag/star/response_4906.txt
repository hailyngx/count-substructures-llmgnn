Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6, 7).
Node 4 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9).
Node 5 has 2 neighbors (3, 7).
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (3, 9).
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9).

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for these nodes: 10 + 20 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are 34 3-stars in this graph. 
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<[3, 2, 4], [3, 2, 5], [3, 2, 6], [3, 2, 7], [3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 7], [3, 5, 6], [3, 5, 7], [3, 6, 7], [4, 0, 1], [4, 0, 2], [4, 0, 8], [4, 0, 9], [4, 1, 2], [4, 1, 8], [4, 1, 9], [4, 2, 8], [4, 2, 9], [4, 8, 9], [9, 0, 6], [9, 0, 7], [9, 6, 7]>. 

Therefore, the final answer is 34.
