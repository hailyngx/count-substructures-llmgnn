Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 7
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, and 8
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 7
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
