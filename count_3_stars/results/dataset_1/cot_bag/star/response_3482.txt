Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can analyze the nodes to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Here are the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

0: 2, 6
1: 2, 5, 7
2: 0, 1, 7, 8
3: 4, 5, 6
4: 3
5: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
6: 0, 3, 5, 7
7: 1, 2, 6
8: 2, 5
9: 5

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Hence, there are a total of 19 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the answer is [19] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, and <6, (0, 3, 5)>.
