Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Here is the detailed analysis for the given graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges.

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: $\binom{7}{3} = 35$
- 3-stars: <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)> and many more

The total number of 3-stars is $1 + 4 + 35 = 40$.

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
