Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges. 

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 5)

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we will find the number of 3-stars formed with that node.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {4, 6, 9}. 
   Number of 3-stars with node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-star with node 0 as center: <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}.
   Number of 3-stars with node 2 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-star with node 2 as center: <2, (3, 4, 5)>

3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 8}.
   Number of 3-stars with node 3 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   3-stars with node 3 as center: 
   <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>

4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 7}.
   Number of 3-stars with node 4 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-star with node 4 as center: <4, (0, 2, 7)>

5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {2, 7, 9}.
   Number of 3-stars with node 5 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-star with node 5 as center: <5, (2, 7, 9)>

6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {0, 3, 8}.
   Number of 3-stars with node 6 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   3-star with node 6 as center: <6, (0, 3, 8)>

7. Node 7 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

8. Node 8 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

9. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>
