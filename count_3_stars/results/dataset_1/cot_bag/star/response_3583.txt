Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are represented by integers from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4 and 7.
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 4, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
