Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given information. 

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges are:
- 0 is connected to 1, 5, 6
- 1 is connected to 0, 3
- 2 is connected to 5, 6
- 3 is connected to 1
- 4 is connected to 5, 6, 8
- 5 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 6, 7
- 6 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- 7 is connected to 5
- 8 is connected to 4, 9
- 9 is connected to 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier.

Considering each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, making it contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, making it contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, making it contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, making it contribute \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up all the contributions: 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>.
