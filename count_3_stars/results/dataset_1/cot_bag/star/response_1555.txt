Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can represent it as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (8, 2), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes: 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 4, 7, 9
Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 3, 6
Node 6 is connected to 5 other nodes: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16 \)

So, there are 16 3-stars in this graph. 

Inside brackets: [16]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 6, 9)>
