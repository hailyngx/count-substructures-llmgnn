Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not contribute any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 28

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
