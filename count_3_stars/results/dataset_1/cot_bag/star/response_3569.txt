Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes with three or more neighbors. Looking at the given graph, we see that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>.
