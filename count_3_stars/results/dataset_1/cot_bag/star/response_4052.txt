Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
We can represent this graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 6), (9, 7)]

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

Checking each node, we find that:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (4, 5, 9) -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (2, 4, 5) -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (1, 3, 6, 5) -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 3, 8) -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (4, 8, 9) -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (1, 6, 7) -> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star	

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each applicable node: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>
