Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 9 <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 6, 9 <2, (1, 2, 6), (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 5 <2, (0, 1, 2), (2, 1, 5)>
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 7 <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, 9 <1, (2, 3, 5), (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1 <1, (1, 6, 2)>
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 3 <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2 <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, 5 <1, (0, 1, 9), (1, 2, 9), (2, 5, 9)>

So, there are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, which are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 2)>
<2, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
