Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with at least 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it forms.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (6, 4, 7)>

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
    - <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 9)>

For Node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <9, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <9, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 4] = 18.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<1, (6, 4, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<9, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (4, 6, 8)>.
