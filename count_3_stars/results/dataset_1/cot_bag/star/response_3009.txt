Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given edges:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to node 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 5

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  These 3-stars are: <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  These 3-stars are: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 5)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  This 3-star is: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  This 3-star is: <6, (3, 5, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10.
So, the final answer is [10].
