Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
  
  - We have a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 8, 9)>
  - We have a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 8, 5)> and <1, (6, 8, 0)>
  - We have a 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
  - We have a 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (2, 3, 6)>
  - We have a 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 7, 9)>
  - We have a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
  - We have a 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (1, 6, 0)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)> and <8, (0, 1, 3)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
  - Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 1 forms 2 3-stars.
  - Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
  - Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.

Adding these up: [1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3] = [10].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10.
