Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
From the given information, the node degrees are as follows:  
- Node 0: 1 edge  
- Node 1: 4 edges  
- Node 2: 6 edges  
- Node 3: 4 edges  
- Node 4: 3 edges  
- Node 5: 4 edges  
- Node 6: 3 edges  
- Node 7: 4 edges  
- Node 8: 3 edges  
- Node 9: 2 edges  

There are no nodes with degrees greater than 3. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  

Adding up the number of 3-stars gives:  
\( 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 37 \)  

Therefore, there are 37 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (2, 5, 6)>  
<1, (2, 5, 8)>  
<1, (5, 6, 7)>  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<2, (1, 5, 8)>  
<2, (3, 5, 7)>  
<2, (3, 7, 8)>  
<2, (5, 6, 7)>  
<2, (5, 6, 8)>  
<2, (5, 7, 8)>  
<3, (5, 7, 9)>  
<3, (5, 8, 9)>  
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
