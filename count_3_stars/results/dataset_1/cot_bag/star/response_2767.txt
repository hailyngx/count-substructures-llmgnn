Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Since each of these nodes can form 10 3-stars, and we have four such nodes, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 5, 9)>.
