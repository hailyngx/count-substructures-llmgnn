Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
