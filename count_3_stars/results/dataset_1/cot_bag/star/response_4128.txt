Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 1] = [15] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
