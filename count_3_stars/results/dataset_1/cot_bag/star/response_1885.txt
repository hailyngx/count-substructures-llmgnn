Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their neighbors:  
Node 0: 2, 7, 8  
Node 1: 2, 4, 7  
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6  
Node 3: 2, 8  
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9  
Node 5: 4  
Node 6: 2, 4, 9  
Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 8  
Node 8: 0, 3, 7  
Node 9: 4, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that can form one:
Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20  
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  

Summing these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 33 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [33].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 7, 8)>  
<1, (2, 4, 7)>  
<2, (0, 1, 3)>  
<2, (0, 1, 4)>  
<2, (0, 1, 6)>  
<2, (1, 3, 4)>  
<2, (1, 3, 6)>  
<2, (1, 4, 6)>  
<2, (3, 4, 6)>  
<4, (1, 2, 5)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>  
<4, (2, 6, 9)>  
<4, (7, 6, 9)>  
<7, (0, 8, 3)>
