Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the provided edge list, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 1: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 4: This node has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6: This node has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5), so there is 1 3-star.
- For node 9: This node has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 16.

Therefore, there are a total of 16 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
