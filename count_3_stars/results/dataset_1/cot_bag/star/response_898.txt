Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows: 
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [14].
