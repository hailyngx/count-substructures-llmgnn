Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
It seems that the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's proceed with finding the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (3, 4)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (4, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4)
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (1, 6)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 = 26.

So, there are 26 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ [26] \]

Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 1)>
