Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges in the graph are:
- 0 is connected to 2 and 9
- 1 is connected to 6 and 7
- 2 is connected to 0 and 9
- 3 is connected to 4
- 4 is connected to 3 and 8
- 5 is connected to 7
- 6 is connected to 1 and 9
- 7 is connected to 1, 5, 8, and 9
- 8 is connected to 4 and 7
- 9 is connected to 0, 2, 6, and 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 2 3-stars
- Node 9: 2 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2] = [8]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 9, 6)>
<2, (0, 9, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 9, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 1)>
