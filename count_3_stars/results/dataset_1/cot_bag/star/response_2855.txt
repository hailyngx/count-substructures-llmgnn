Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
5. Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
7. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars:

<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
