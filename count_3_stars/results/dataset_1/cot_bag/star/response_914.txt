Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 25 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
