Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9 (degree=4)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 8 (degree=2)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 9 (degree=2)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 9 (degree=2)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2 (degree=2)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 8 (degree=2)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 9 (degree=3)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 6 (degree=2)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7 (degree=4)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars are:

- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 9, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 7, 4)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
