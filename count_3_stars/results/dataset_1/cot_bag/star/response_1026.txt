Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 8, and 9. 
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
   The 3-stars involving node 0 are: 
   <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>
   
- For node 3: $\binom{7}{3} = 35$
   The 3-stars involving node 3 are:
   <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- For node 6: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
   The 3-stars involving node 6 are:
   <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>

- For node 8: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   The 3-stars involving node 8 are:
   <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 9)>

- For node 9: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
   The 3-stars involving node 9 are:
   <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 8)>

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars:    
\[ [10 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [69] \]
