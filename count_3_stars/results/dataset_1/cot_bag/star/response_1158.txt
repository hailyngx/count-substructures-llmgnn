Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.

For node 2:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <2, (0, 3, 5)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <4, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 7: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <6, (4, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <7, (4, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
