Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighboring nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [1] 
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 9: [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
