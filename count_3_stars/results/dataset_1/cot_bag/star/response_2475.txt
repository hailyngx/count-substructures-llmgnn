Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7.

For node 0: It has 2 3-stars. 
For node 2: It has 3 3-stars.
For node 4: It has 2 3-stars.
For node 5: It has 3 3-stars.
For node 7: It has 3 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 13.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (3, 7, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 2)>
<4, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 4)>
<5, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>

Please note that the ordering of nodes within each 3-star does not matter.
