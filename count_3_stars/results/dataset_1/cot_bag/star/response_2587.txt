Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: [1, 3, 7]
- Node 1: [0, 4, 6]
- Node 2: [6]
- Node 3: [0, 4, 5, 7]
- Node 4: [1, 3]
- Node 5: [3, 6, 9]
- Node 6: [1, 2, 5, 9]
- Node 7: [0, 3, 8]
- Node 8: [7]
- Node 9: [5, 6]

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0] = 12

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
