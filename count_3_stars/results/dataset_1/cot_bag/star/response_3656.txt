Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 36

So, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
