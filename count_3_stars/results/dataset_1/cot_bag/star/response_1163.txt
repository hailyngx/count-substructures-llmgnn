Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

For node 0: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the provided graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>
