Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 43 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars is [43].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
