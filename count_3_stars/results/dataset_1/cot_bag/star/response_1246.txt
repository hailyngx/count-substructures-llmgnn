Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can represent the given graph with nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
  - 0: {2, 7}
  - 1: {7, 9}
  - 2: {0, 3}
  - 3: {2, 8}
  - 4: {8, 9}
  - 5: {6, 7, 8}
  - 6: {5}
  - 7: {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
  - 8: {3, 4, 5, 7}
  - 9: {1, 4, 7}

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
  - <7, (0, 1, 5)>
  - <7, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <7, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <7, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <7, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <7, (8, 9, 1)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  - <8, (3, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <8, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [16]
