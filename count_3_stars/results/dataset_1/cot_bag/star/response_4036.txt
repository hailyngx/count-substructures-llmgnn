Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: 
Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $.

- For node 1: 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 1 is 1.

- For node 2: 
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 2 is 1.

- For node 4: 
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $.

- For node 5: 
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 5 is $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $.

- For node 6: 
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 6 is $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 56 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>.
