Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [13]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (7, 8, 5)>
