Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 0, 2, 4, 8, 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) and sum them up.

For Node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 2, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 9, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20 \)

So, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, 
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 8, 3>, <0, 8, 4>, <0, 8, 7>, <0, 9, 4>, <0, 9, 7>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <8, 4, 7>
