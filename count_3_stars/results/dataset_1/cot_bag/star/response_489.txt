Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, and 9.

For node 1:
- Number of possible 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)> are the unique 3-stars.

For node 4:
- Number of possible 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <4, (1, 3, 6)> is the unique 3-star.

For node 5:
- Number of possible 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

For node 9:
- Number of possible 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <9, (1, 5, 8)> is the unique 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 1 + 1 = 22 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
