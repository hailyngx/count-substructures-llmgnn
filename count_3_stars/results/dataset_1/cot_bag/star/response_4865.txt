Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 2, 5, 8  
Node 1: 6, 7  
Node 2: 0, 7, 8    
Node 3: 8    
Node 5: 0, 9  
Node 6: 1, 9  
Node 7: 1, 2, 8  
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 7  
Node 9: 5, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10.  

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in this graph, and the unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 5, 8)>  
<2, (0, 7, 8)>  
<7, (1, 2, 8)>  
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
