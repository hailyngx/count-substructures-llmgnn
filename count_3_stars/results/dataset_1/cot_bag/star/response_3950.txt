Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are represented as follows: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 4 neighbors
Node 7 has 3 neighbors
Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 14 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 3)>,
<7, (5, 8, 9)>,
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
