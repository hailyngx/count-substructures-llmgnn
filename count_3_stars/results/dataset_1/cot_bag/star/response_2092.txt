Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the graph by representing the nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: ${9 \choose 3} = 84$
- Node 1: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$
- Node 4: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 5: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$
- Node 9: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 7: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 84 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 136

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [136].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
1. <0, 1, 8, 9>
2. <0, 1, 5, 8>
3. <0, 1, 5, 9>
4. <0, 1, 4, 8>
5. <0, 1, 4, 9>
6. <1, 0, 5, 6>
7. <1, 4, 2, 9>
8. <1, 5, 0, 8>
9. <1, 5, 0, 9>
10. <5, 0, 1, 6>
11. <5, 1, 0, 8>
12. <5, 1, 0, 9>
13. <5, 6, 3, 7>
14. <5, 7, 3, 6>
15. <9, 0, 1, 4>
16. <9, 7, 3, 6>
