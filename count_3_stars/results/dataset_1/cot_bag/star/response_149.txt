Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to determine the 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (8, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  <2, (1, 5, 6)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  <3, (0, 7, 4)>

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 5 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 6 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  <8, (0, 5, 9)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (1, 0, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
