Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. 
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, and 8.

For node 0:
Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 1:
Since node 1 has 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 5:
Since node 5 has 3 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 8:
Since node 8 has 3 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (7, 0, 9)>
