Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 8, 5)>
