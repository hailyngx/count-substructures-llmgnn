Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 9)>

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 2, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars is [8]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
