Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 3, 8)>
- <2, (7, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 2, 8)>
