Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are described as given. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 1 has 6 neighbors  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors  
Node 5 has 5 neighbors  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors  
Node 9 has 2 neighbors  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:  
Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
Total = 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 33  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33], and the unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (0, 4, 6)>  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>  
<1, (4, 5, 6)>  
<1, (5, 6, 9)>  

<2, (1, 3, 5)>  

<3, (2, 5, 6)>  

<5, (1, 2, 3)>  
<5, (1, 4, 6)>  
<5, (2, 3, 4)>  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>  

<6, (1, 3, 9)>
