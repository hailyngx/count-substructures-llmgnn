Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes listed above:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up, we have a total of 24 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (1, 3, 7)>
- <1, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (1, 8, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 4)>
- <1, (7, 0, 3)>
- <1, (7, 0, 4)>
- <1, (7, 3, 4)>
- <1, (7, 4, 8)>
- <2, (6, 9, 2)>
- <4, (8, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 1)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (3, 1, 0)>
- <7, (3, 1, 4)>
- <7, (3, 1, 8)>
- <7, (4, 0, 1)>
- <7, (4, 1, 3)>
- <7, (4, 1, 8)>
- <8, (4, 1, 7)>
- <9, (8, 1, 4)>
