Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7, 8, and 9 each have 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 1 = 21 \). 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (1, 8, 9)>
