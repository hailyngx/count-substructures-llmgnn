Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3 and node 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- The total number of 3-stars formed with node 3 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- The total number of 3-stars formed with node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 10] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<3, (0, 1, 5)>
