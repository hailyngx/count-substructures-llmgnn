Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Based on the given edges, the adjacency list for each node is:
0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
1: {3, 4, 8}
2: {0, 3, 7}
3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
5: {0, 3, 6}
6: {4, 5}
7: {0, 2, 3, 9}
8: {1, 3, 4}
9: {3, 7}

Now we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 3 has 8 neighbors so it can form inom{8}{3} = 56 3-stars.
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 4 has 5 neighbors so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors so it can only form one 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 10 + 56 + 10 + 1 + 4 = [81].
