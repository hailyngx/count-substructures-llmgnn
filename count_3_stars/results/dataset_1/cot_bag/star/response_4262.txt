Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 9)>
<7, (9, 8, 8)>
