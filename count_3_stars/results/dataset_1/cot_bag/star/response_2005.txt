Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 4), (8, 1), (8, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 1 neighbor
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 6 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Number of 3-stars involving node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars involving node 1: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Number of 3-stars involving node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
