Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3-star: <2, (3, 5, 9)>)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (3, 0, 8)>, <3, (3, 2, 8)>, <3, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (3, 5, 9)>)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3-star: <4, (7, 8, 0)>)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3-star: <6, (7, 8, 9)>)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (3-star: <8, (3, 4, 6)>)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 1)>)

Putting the results together:
- Total number of 3-stars formed: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
