Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 20
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars found within <> are:
<1, (7, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 9, 0)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 9, 6)>.
