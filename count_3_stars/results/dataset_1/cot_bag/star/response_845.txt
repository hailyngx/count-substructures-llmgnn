Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 5, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25 \)  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [25].

Next, we list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
