Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the nodes and edges diagram of the given graph: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph: 

For node 0: Since it has 2 neighbors (7, 9), it cannot form a 3-star.
For node 1: It has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6). <1, (3, 5, 6)>
For node 2: It has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9). <2, (4, 7, 9)>
For node 3: It has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For node 4: It has 2 neighbors (2, 5), it cannot form a 3-star.
For node 5: It has 2 neighbors (1, 4), it cannot form a 3-star.
For node 6: It has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 8). <6, (1, 7, 8)>
For node 7: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6). <7, (0, 2, 6)>
For node 8: It has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
For node 9: It has 2 neighbors (0, 2), it cannot form a 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 2 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 6)> and <2, (4, 7, 9)>.
