Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of them. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 8
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7
Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 5
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7
Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7

We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For node 5: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
For node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4] = 30. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
