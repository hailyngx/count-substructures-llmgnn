Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes of the 3-stars. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>

Node 3: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 4: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>

Node 5: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 7, 8)>

Node 6: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Node 9: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
