Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3

Node 0 has 3 neighbors which forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors which forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors which forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors which forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors which forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors which forms 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors which doesn't form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors which doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [9] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 5)>.
