Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has four neighbors (4, 6, 7, and 9).
- Total number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4:
- Node 4 has five neighbors (0, 3, 5, 6, and 7).
- Total number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 5:
- Node 5 has four neighbors (2, 3, 4, and 7).
- Total number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6:
- Node 6 has four neighbors (0, 3, 4, and 7).
- Total number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7:
- Node 7 has five neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, and 9).
- Total number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 9:
- Node 9 has four neighbors (0, 1, 2, and 7).
- Total number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [36] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>
