Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's consider each of these nodes:

For node 3: It has neighbors 1, 2, 6. So, it can form 1 3-star.
For node 4: It has neighbors 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9. So, it can form 6 3-stars.
For node 5: It has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
For node 6: It has neighbors 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
For node 8: It has neighbors 6, 7. As it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.
For node 9: It has neighbors 4, 5, 6. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>.

So the final answer is [10].
