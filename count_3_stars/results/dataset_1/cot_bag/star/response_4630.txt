Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To start, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors 2, 4, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 5, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2: neighbors 0, 1, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: neighbors 5, 6, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 2, 3, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: neighbors 2, 3, 7 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <0, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <0, (6, 7, 2)>
  - <0, (7, 2, 6)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <1, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (6, 0, 9)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <3, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 0, 7)>
  - <6, (7, 0, 3)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15 3-stars in this graph.
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
