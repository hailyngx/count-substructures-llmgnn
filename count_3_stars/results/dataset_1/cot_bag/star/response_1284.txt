Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
```
    0 -- 2        3
     \  /|\      /
       6 1--4--5
          |   |/
          9--8
          |
          7
```

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5, 7)

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39]. 

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>
