Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 0), (6, 3), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors (5, 8), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Node 1:
Node 1 has 2 neighbors (7, 9), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Node 2: 
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. 
<2, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 3:
Node 3 has 1 neighbor (6), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Node 4:
Node 4 has 1 neighbor (8), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Node 5:
Node 5 has 1 neighbor (0), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Node 6:
Node 6 has 1 neighbor (3), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Node 7:
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars. 
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 8:
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Node 9:
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7), so it can form 4 3-stars.
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+4+1+4] = 10.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
