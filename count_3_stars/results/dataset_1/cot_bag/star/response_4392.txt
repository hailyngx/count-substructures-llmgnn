Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 0
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, there are \(4 + 10 + 4 = 18\) 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, and <7, (0, 3, 9)>.
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [18].
