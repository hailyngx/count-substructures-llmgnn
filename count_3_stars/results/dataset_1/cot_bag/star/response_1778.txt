Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To simplify the process, let's first list the neighbors of each node and then count the number of 3-stars centered at each node.

Node 0: Neighbors = 5, 9  
Node 1: Neighbors = 4, 8, 9  
Node 2: Neighbors = 5, 6  
Node 3: Neighbors = 4, 6, 7, 9  
Node 4: Neighbors = 1, 3  
Node 5: Neighbors = 0, 2, 7, 8  
Node 6: Neighbors = 2, 3, 7  
Node 7: Neighbors = 3, 5, 6, 9  
Node 8: Neighbors = 1, 5  
Node 9: Neighbors = 0, 1, 3, 7  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [0] (Only 2 neighbors)  
Node 1: [1] <1, (4, 8, 9)>  
Node 2: [0] (Only 2 neighbors)  
Node 3: [1] <3, (4, 6, 7)>  
Node 4: [0] (Only 2 neighbors)  
Node 5: [1] <5, (0, 7, 8)>  
Node 6: [0] (Only 2 neighbors)  
Node 7: [1] <7, (3, 5, 9)>  
Node 8: [0] (Only 2 neighbors)  
Node 9: [1] <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1]

The unique 3-star found: <1, (4, 8, 9)>
