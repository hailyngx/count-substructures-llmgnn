Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 1), (6, 2), (6, 9), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, 5, 9 (degree = 4)
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 3, 6 (degree = 3)
- Node 3 has neighbors 2, 8, 9 (degree = 3)
- Node 4 has neighbors 8, 9 (degree = 2)
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 9 (degree = 2)
- Node 8 has neighbors 3, 4 (degree = 2)
- Node 9 has neighbors 1, 3, 4, 6 (degree = 4)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 = 8, which is represented as [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
