Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
\[ [ 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 ] = [ 39 ] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
