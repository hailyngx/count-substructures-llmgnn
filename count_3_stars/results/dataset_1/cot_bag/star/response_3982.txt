Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 8, and 9. Let's find the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: It has 3 neighbors - 3, 5, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0.
2. Node 3: It has 4 neighbors - 0, 2, 5, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
3. Node 8: It has 4 neighbors - 1, 3, 4, and 7. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.
4. Node 9: It has 4 neighbors - 0, 2, 4, and 6. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [13] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>.
