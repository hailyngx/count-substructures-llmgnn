Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Using the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) with the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 combination
- Node 1: 1 combination
- Node 2: 1 combination
- Node 4: 1 combination
- Node 5: 1 combination
- Node 8: 1 combination

Total number of 3-stars = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
