Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<2, (0, 3, 9)>

Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ [10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [40] \]

So, there are 40 total 3-stars in the given graph.
