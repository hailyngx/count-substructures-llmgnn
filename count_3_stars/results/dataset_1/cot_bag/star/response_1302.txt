Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6)

Number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 11]

Unique 3-stars: 
1. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
3. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
6. <7, (1, 4, 6)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
