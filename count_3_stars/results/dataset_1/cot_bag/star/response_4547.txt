Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
