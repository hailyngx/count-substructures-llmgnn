Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will start by listing the nodes that have three or more neighbors and finding the possible 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8
  Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
  Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>,
                  <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
  Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 8)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
  Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>,
                  <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 0, 2)>, <8, (7, 0, 9)>, <8, (7, 2, 9)>

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 8
  Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node:
1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 0, 2)>, <8, (7, 0, 9)>, <8, (7, 2, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
