Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node and its neighbors to determine how many 3-stars can be formed around it.

Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors 4, 8, and 9
- Node 1 has neighbors 5, 6, and 9
- Node 2 has neighbors 3, 4, and 5
- Node 3 has neighbors 2, 8, and 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 2, 5
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6 has neighbor 1
- Node 7 has neighbor 5
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 3
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{1}{3}] = 0
- Node 7: [inom{1}{3}] = 0
- Node 8: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing these up, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>.
