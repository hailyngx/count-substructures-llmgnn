Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

So, the final answer is: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>
