Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 2), (5, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 9), (8, 2), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 4)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 22

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (6, 8, 2)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (6, 9, 3)>, <3, (2, 6, 4)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>
