Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: Node 1, Node 7, Node 8
    - Number of 3-stars at Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
        Unique 3-stars at Node 0: <0, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 3, Node 4
    - Number of 3-stars at Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
        Unique 3-stars at Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 4)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: Node 4, Node 5, Node 6
    - Number of 3-stars at Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
        Unique 3-stars at Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 6)>

- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 0, Node 6
    - Number of 3-stars at Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
        Unique 3-stars at Node 6: 
        <6, (2, 3, 5)>
        <6, (2, 5, 8)>
        <6, (2, 8, 0)>
        <6, (2, 0, 6)>
        <6, (3, 5, 8)>
        <6, (3, 8, 0)>
        <6, (3, 0, 6)>
        <6, (5, 8, 0)>
        <6, (5, 0, 6)>
        <6, (8, 0, 6)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 6, Node 8
    - Number of 3-stars at Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
        Unique 3-stars at Node 8: <8, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1] = [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 0)>
<6, (2, 0, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 0, 6)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 0, 6)>
<6, (8, 0, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
