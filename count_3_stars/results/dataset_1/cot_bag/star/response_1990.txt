Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 7}.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 7}.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 9}.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [26]. \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 3, 7>
- <3, 1, 5>
- <4, 1, 2>
- <4, 1, 5>
- <4, 1, 6>
- <4, 1, 8>
- <4, 2, 5>
- <4, 2, 6>
- <4, 2, 8>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <7, 1, 2>
- <7, 1, 3>
- <7, 1, 5>
- <7, 1, 8>
- <7, 2, 5>
- <7, 2, 8>
- <7, 3, 5>
- <7, 3, 8>
- <7, 5, 8>
- <4, 7, 8>
