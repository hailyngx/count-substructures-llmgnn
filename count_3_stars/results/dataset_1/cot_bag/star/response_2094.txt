Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 (5 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
