Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 5

We can now determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7: <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 6: <4, (0, 8, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 0: <5, (3, 9, 0)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <8, (4, 6, 7)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [6].
