Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  

Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)  
Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)  
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6 (3 neighbors)  
Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1 (2 neighbors)  
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 5 (2 neighbors)  
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 9 (2 neighbors)  
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 7 (2 neighbors)  

Now, we apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to each node with three or more neighbors:  

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 1 as the center   
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 2 as the center  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6  
Therefore, the final answer is [6].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (2, 3, 4)>  
<0, (2, 4, 7)>  
<0, (3, 4, 7)>  
<0, (2, 4, 3)>  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>  
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
