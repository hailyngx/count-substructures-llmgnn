Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

         0 ---- 4
         |      |
         |      |
         1      9
          \    /
            6
            | \
            |   7
            |   |
             \ /
              3
              |   \
              |     2
              |     |
              5     8

Now, let's determine the 3-star clusters:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star <3, (1, 2, 4)> and <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (0, 2, 9)> and <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (1, 7, 9)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
