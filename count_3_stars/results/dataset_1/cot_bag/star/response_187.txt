Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 5)

Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {1, 4, 7}, forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 8}, forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(inom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14\)

Inside brackets: [14]

Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>
