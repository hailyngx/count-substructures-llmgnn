Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
Out of its 5 neighbors, we can choose 3 to form a 3-star: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 1:
Out of its 2 neighbors, we can choose 1 3-star: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \)

Similarly, for nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9:
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{1} = 2 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 23 \)

So, there are 23 3-stars in this graph. Putting this final number inside brackets: [23]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
