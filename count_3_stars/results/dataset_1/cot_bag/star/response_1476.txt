Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes that each node is connected to based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars from the nodes where they are formed, we get a total of 1 + 10 + 4 = 15 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [15]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>
