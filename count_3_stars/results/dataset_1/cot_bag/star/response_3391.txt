Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 and Node 9 cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 8)>
