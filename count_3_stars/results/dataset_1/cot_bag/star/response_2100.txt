Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph based on the given information:

```
0 -- 1     2
|         /
6       4 -- 7
        |    |
      3 -- 5
       \ /
        9
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors (1, 6) - no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors (0, 9) - no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 2: has 1 neighbor - no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9) - 1 3-star can be formed
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 9) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors (3, 7) - no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor - no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors (4, 5) - no 3-stars can be formed
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \)

Thus, the final answer is [9] with the unique 3-stars being <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, and <9, (3, 4, 9)>.
