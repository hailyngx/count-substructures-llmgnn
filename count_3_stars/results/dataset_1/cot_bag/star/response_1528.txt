Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 4, 8, 9 neighbors
- Node 3: 6, 7 neighbors
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 8 neighbors
- Node 6: 3, 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3, 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 1, 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3, 4, 6, and 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4*4 = 17 \)

So, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 4)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 3, 6)>, <4, (8, 1, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 4)>, <8, (1, 9, 4)>, <8, (4, 1, 9)>, <8, (9, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 8, 4)>
