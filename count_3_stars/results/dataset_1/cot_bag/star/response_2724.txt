Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), 
(3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), 
(4, 9), 
(5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9), 
(7, 3), 
(8, 3), (8, 5), 
(9, 4), (9, 5)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: 3-stars = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars = 3 (1 for each neighbor combination)
- Node 5: 3-stars = 3 (1 for each neighbor combination)
- Node 8: 3-stars = 3 (1 for each neighbor combination)
- Node 9: 3-stars = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets []: [11]

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
