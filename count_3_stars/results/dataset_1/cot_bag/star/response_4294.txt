Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (degree 6)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 5)
- Node 7 (degree 5)

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we get:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 44 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 4)>
<(3, 4, 5)>
<(4, 5, 9)>
<(6, 5, 7)>
<(7, 8, 0)>
