Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 6, 7
Node 3: 4, 5
Node 4: 3, 6, 8
Node 5: 3, 6, 7
Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 7: 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 4, 7

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- For Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8, so the answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (0, 8, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>.
