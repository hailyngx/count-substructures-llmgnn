Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a few nodes that have three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 14 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>.
