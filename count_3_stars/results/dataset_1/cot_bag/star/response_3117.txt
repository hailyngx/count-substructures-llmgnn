Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20 + 10 = 30. Therefore, the final answer is [30].

Let's now list the unique 3-stars found:
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
