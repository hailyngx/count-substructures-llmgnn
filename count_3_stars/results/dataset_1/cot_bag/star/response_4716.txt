Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges you provided can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 4),
(1, 4), (1, 5),
(2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 8),
(3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 9),
(4, 0), (4, 1),
(5, 1),
(6, 3), (6, 7),
(7, 6),
(8, 2), (8, 9),
(9, 3), (9, 8)

Now let's determine the 3-stars in this graph by following the steps mentioned earlier. We'll consider each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4) -> 1 3-star
Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5) -> 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 8) -> 1 3-star
Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 9) -> 1 3-star
Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1) -> 1 3-star
Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 7) -> 1 3-star
Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 9) -> 1 3-star
Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 8) -> 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4)>, <1, (4, 5)>, <2, (0, 3)>, <3, (2, 6)>, <4, (0, 1)>, <6, (3, 7)>, <8, (2, 9)>
