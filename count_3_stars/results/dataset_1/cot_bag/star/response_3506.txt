Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (7, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
