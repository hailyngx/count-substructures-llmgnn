Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 has neighbors 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 has neighbors 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 has neighbors 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 has neighbors 1 and 5.
- Node 9 has neighbors 3, 4, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
