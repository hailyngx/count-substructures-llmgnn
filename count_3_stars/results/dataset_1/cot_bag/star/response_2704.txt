Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 7)
- Node 1: 6 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 47

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>.
