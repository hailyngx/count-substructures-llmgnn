Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 2, 4, 8
Node 1: 2, 9
Node 2: 0, 1
Node 3: 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 3, 4, 7
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: [$ {3 \choose 3} = 1 $] 3-star
Node 1: No 3-stars (only has 2 neighbors)
Node 2: No 3-stars (only has 2 neighbors)
Node 3: [$ {4 \choose 3} = 4 $] 3-stars
Node 4: [$ {4 \choose 3} = 4 $] 3-stars
Node 5: No 3-stars (only has 3 neighbors)
Node 6: No 3-stars (only has 1 neighbor)
Node 7: [$ {5 \choose 3} = 10 $] 3-stars
Node 8: No 3-stars (only has 2 neighbors)
Node 9: No 3-stars (only has 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 19.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
