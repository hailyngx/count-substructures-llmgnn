Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 11 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, we can represent the 3-stars as follows: 

<2, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 8, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>.

So, there are 11 3-stars in total, which we represent as [11].
