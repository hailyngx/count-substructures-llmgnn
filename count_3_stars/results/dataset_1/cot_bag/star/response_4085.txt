Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1

From the degrees of the nodes, only nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \)

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>
