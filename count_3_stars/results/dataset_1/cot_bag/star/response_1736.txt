Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0}
- Node 6: {0, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7}

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: As it has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: As it has 5 neighbors, it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4: As it has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: As it has 4 neighbors, it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9: As it has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [26] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 3, 7, 8>
- <0, 3, 7, 9>
- <0, 3, 8, 9>
- <0, 5, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 7, 9>
