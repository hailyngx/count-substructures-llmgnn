Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [26].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [26]. 
        Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 3, 5)>.
