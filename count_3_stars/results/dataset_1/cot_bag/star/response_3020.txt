Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26 \), so the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
