Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 3

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 2: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors
Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
