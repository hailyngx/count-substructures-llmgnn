Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [23].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (6, 5, 0)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
