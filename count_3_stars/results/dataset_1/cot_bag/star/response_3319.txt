Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes can be represented visually as follows:
```
    1 --- 6
     \     \
      \     7
       2 --- 6
      /|     |
    3  |     |
    |  |     |
    4  |     8
     \ |    /
       5 --- 3
          /
         9
```

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

For node 1: Only 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
For node 2: 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
For node 3: 6 neighbors, so there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars.
For node 4: 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
For node 5: 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.
For node 6: 4 neighbors, so there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
For node 7: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 8: 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars.
For node 9: 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: $20 + 4 + 1 = 25$

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $[25]$.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (5, 7, 9)>,  
<3, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
