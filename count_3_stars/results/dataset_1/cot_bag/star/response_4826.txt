Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
0: 3, 8  
1: 6  
2: 3, 5, 6, 9  
3: 0, 2, 4  
4: 3, 5, 7, 8  
5: 2, 4, 6, 9  
6: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8  
7: 4, 6  
8: 0, 4, 6, 9  
9: 2, 5, 8  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:

- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>  

- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>  

- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 9)>  

- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>  

- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
<8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>  

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of [20].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>,  
<4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>,  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 5, 9)>,  
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>,  
<8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>.
