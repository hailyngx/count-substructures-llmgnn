Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw out the graph with the given nodes and edges:
```
    0 --- 3       5
    |     |       |
    8 --- 7 --- 6
      \   |   /
        \ | /
          9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 7
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 9, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3 stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2 forms 3 stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6 forms 3 stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7 forms 3 stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8 forms 4 stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9 forms 3 stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 8, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 7)>
- <7, (6, 8, 8)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 8, 8)>
