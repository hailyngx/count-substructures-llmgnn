Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: it has 2 3-stars.
- For node 1: it has 3 3-stars.
- For node 2: it has 1 3-star.
- For node 3: it has 3 3-stars.
- For node 5: it has 3 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 2 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>.
