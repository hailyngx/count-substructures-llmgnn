Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star graphs based on the above information:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 0 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 27 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <1, 0, 2>
- <1, 2, 8>
- <2, 0, 1>
- <2, 1, 3>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <2, 3, 5>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <3, 1, 2>
- <8, 0, 1>
- <8, 1, 2>
- <8, 1, 4>
- <8, 1, 6>
