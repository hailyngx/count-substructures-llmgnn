Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 1)>
<2, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (3, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 7, 4)>
<7, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 8, 6)>
<8, (2, 8, 7)>
