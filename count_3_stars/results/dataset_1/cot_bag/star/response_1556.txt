Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 27\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 27. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 3, 8>
<5, 7, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 4>
<5, 7, 2>
<5, 7, 1>
<5, 4, 7>
<5, 4, 2>
<5, 4, 1>
<7, 5, 1>
<7, 5, 2>
<7, 5, 4>
<7, 5, 8>
<7, 2, 5>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 2, 1>
<7, 2, 9>
<7, 4, 5>
<7, 4, 2>
<7, 4, 1>
<7, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 7>
<8, 5, 1>
<8, 3, 1>
<9, 7, 5>
<9, 7, 3> 

Putting them inside angle brackets, the final list is:
<1, 3, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 4>, <5, 7, 2>, <5, 7, 1>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 4, 2>, <5, 4, 1>, <7, 5, 1>, <7, 5, 2>, <7, 5, 4>, <7, 5, 8>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 2, 4>, <7, 2, 1>, <7, 2, 9>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 4, 2>, <7, 4, 1>, <7, 4, 9>, <8, 5, 7>, <8, 5, 1>, <8, 3, 1>, <9, 7, 5>, <9, 7, 3>
