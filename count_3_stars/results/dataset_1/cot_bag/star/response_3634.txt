Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes:

- For Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1] = 32 \)

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <1, (4, 0, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 8, 5)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
