Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7 -> \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9 -> \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8 -> \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5 -> \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3 -> \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7 -> \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5 -> No 3-stars
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9 -> No 3-stars
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 8 -> No 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \([4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 21\).
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 2, 5)>, <0, (4, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>.
