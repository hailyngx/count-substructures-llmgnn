Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll start by determining which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.  

After analyzing the given information, we find that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors.  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 
    - Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 7, 9).
    - Number of 3-stars involving node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)> 

- Node 1: 
    - Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4).
    - Number of 3-stars involving node 1: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>

- Node 3: 
    - Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 9).
    - Number of 3-stars involving node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 4:
    - Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 9).
    - Number of 3-stars involving node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 9:
    - Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 9).
    - Number of 3-stars involving node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 29.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].
