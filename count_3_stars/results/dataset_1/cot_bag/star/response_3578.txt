Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 17 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 9, 5)>.
