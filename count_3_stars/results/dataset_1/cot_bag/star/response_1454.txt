Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 7}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0:  C(2, 3) = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1:  C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2:  C(2, 3) = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3:  C(2, 3) = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6:  C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 7:  C(4, 3) = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>
