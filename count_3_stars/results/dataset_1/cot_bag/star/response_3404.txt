Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 1, 2, 7
Node 1: 0, 3, 4
Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 8
Node 4: 1, 6, 7
Node 5: 2, 3
Node 6: 2, 4
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 8: 3

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding these together gives us a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>.
