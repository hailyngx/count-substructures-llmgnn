Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 7
    |  \/ |
    |  /\ |
    0 -- 4 -- 9
        |    |
        2 -- 5
        
        3 -- 6 -- 8
```

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 4.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 7.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 5.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 7.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, and 9. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 8. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 6.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = {10 \choose 3} = 120 \]

Therefore, there are 120 total 3-star configurations in this graph.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- < 1, (0, 4, 7) >
- < 4, (0, 2, 7) >
- < 6, (3, 7, 8) > 

So, the final answer is: [120]. The unique 3-stars are: < 1, (0, 4, 7) >, < 4, (0, 2, 7) >, < 6, (3, 7, 8) >.
