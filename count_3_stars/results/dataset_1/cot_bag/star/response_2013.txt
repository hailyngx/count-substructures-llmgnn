Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8:

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 15 3-stars in the given graph, which we'll represent as [15].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 4, 6)>
<2, (6, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 3)>
<5, (1, 7, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 9, 8)>
<7, (3, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (9, 3, 7)>
<8, (9, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the final representation is [15], and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
