Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \).

 Therefore, the final result is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
