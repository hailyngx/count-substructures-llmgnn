Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 8

For node 0:
No 3-stars can be formed with node 0 since it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors (0, 3, 8, 9) for node 2. 
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 3:
There are 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 8) for node 3. 
Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center = inom{5}{3} = 10

For node 8:
There are 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5, 7) for node 8. 
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center = inom{5}{3} = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 10 = 24, which we will put inside brackets as [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
