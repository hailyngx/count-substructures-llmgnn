Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 each have exactly 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 23. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23], and they are:
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 0, 8)>
- <5, (6, 2, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 2)>
- <5, (0, 8, 2)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 2, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (3, 9, 5)>
- <7, (9, 5, 2)>
- <7, (9, 2, 4)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 3)>
- <7, (5, 3, 9)>
- <7, (5, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 9, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 5)>
