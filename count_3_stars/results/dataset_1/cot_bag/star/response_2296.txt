Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Based on the given edges, we can represent the graph as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9: <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 5: <7, (6, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
