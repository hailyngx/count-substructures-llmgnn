Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
