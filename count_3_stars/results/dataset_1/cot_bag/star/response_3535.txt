Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these together: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 8, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
