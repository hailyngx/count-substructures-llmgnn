Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each such node.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 6, 7.

For node 0:
Since node 0 has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 3:
Since node 3 has 4 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 6:
Since node 6 has 4 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 7:
Since node 7 has 6 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 38 \).
So the final count inside brackets is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
