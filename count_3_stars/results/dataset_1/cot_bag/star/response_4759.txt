Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 4, 5, 6
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 9
Node 5: 0, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 2, 8
Node 7: 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 9: 4, 5

Let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [inom{4}{3} ] = [4]
Node 2: [inom{5}{3} ] = [10]
Node 3: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: [1]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [inom{5}{3} ] = [10]
Node 9: [1]

Adding them up: [1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [30]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30, and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 9, 5)>, <4, (9, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 7)>
