Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <2, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <2, (8, 9, 0)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <3, (1, 2, 5)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <8, (0, 2, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (1, 2, 7)>
  - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (2, 0, 7)>
  - <8, (2, 1, 7)>
  - <8, (2, 0, 9)>
  - <8, (2, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 7, 2)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <9, (2, 8, 0)>
  - <9, (4, 8, 0)>
  - <9, (8, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 23.
