Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<1, (0, 2, 6)>

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (1, 3, 8)>

For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<7, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
