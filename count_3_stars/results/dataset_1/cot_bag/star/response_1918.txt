Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: forms 10 3-stars
- Node 6: forms 4 3-stars
- Node 7: forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8: forms 5 3-stars
- Node 9: forms 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 5 + 4 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
