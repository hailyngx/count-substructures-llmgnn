Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges:  
(0, 4)  (0, 5)  (0, 8)  
(1, 4)  
(2, 4)  (2, 6)  
(3, 6)  
(4, 0)  (4, 1)  (4, 2)  (4, 9)  
(5, 0)  (5, 6)  (5, 8)  
(6, 2)  (6, 3)  (6, 5)  (6, 9)  
(7, 8)  (7, 9)  
(8, 0)  (8, 5)  (8, 7)  
(9, 4)  (9, 6)  (9, 7)  

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star. <0, (4, 5, 8)>

Node 4: has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>,  
<4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>

Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star. <8, (0, 5, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16.  

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
