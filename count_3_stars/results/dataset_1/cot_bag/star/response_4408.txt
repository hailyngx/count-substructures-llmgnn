Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 21

So, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
