Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 8), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 7)]

To find the total number of 3-stars, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: {1, 6}
Node 1: {0, 8}
Node 3: {5, 6}
Node 5: {3, 6}
Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8}
Node 7: {6, 9}
Node 8: {1, 4, 6}
Node 9: {7}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 9: inom{1}{3} = 0 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1] = [12]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
