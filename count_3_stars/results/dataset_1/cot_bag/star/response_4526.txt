Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 2, 8
Node 1: 0, 3, 4
Node 2: 0, 6, 9
Node 3: 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 5
Node 5: 4, 7
Node 6: 2, 3
Node 7: 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 3, 7
Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
