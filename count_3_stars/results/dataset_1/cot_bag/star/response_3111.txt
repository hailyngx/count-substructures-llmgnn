Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars: Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 7.

For Node 0: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>

For Node 1: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<1, (4, 6, 9)>

For Node 3: There are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>

For Node 4: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<4, (1, 6, 7)>

For Node 7: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<7, (0, 4, 8)>

Adding them up, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1] = 24 3-stars.
