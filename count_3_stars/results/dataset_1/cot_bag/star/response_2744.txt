Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
