Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, here is the breakdown of 3-stars:

For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 0: has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 9) so it can form 1 3-star.
<0, (1, 5, 9)>

Node 1: has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 6, 8) so it can form 10 3-stars.
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 0, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>

Node 3: has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 7, 8) so it can form 10 3-stars.
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 0, 1)>
<3, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 5: has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9) so it can form 15 3-stars.
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 0, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<5, (1, 8, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 1)>
<5, (4, 0, 5)>
<5, (8, 1, 3)>
<5, (8, 7, 3)>

Node 9: has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7) so it can form 4 3-stars.
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 0, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 4] = 40.
