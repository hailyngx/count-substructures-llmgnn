Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Other nodes have less than 3 neighbors and do not form 3-stars.

Therefore, there is only 1 3-star in this graph, which is centered at node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
