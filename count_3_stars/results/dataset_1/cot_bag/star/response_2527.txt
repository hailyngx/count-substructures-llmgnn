Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are provided. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 7
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 4
- Node 8 has neighbors: 6, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have three or more neighbors, we find:

- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 10] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
