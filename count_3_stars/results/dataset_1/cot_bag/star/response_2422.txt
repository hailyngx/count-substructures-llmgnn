Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:  
- It has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9).  
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>

For node 1:  
- It has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5).  
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 4:  
- It has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9).  
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, and their symmetric counterparts.

For node 5:  
- It has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 7, 9).  
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (5, 7, 9)>, and their symmetric counterparts.

For node 6:  
- It has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7).  
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>

For node 9:  
- It has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7, 8).  
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, and their symmetric counterparts.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 46  

So, the final answer is [46].
