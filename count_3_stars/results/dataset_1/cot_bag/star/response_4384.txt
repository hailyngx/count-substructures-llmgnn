Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 7

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>.
