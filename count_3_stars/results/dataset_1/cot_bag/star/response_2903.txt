Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 7

Now, we'll check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 9: <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 9: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 4: <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 7: <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 7: <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>.
