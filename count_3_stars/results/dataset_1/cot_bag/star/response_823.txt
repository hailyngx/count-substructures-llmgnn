Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Since the graph contains 10 nodes, we'll analyze each node and check if it has at least three neighbors.

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1,5), (5,6), (5,9)
  - Total 3-stars with node 5: [1]
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (5,6), (6,7), (6,9)
  - Total 3-stars with node 6: [1]
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (1,9), (5,9), (6,9)
  - Total 3-stars with node 9: [1]
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
