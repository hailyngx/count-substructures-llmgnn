Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors. Let's list those nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

So, there are a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = 13 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, 1, 7>
<3, 8, 9>
<7, 2, 8>
