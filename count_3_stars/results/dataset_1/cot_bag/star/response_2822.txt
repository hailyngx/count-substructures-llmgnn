Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph.
