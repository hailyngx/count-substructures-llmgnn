Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
Node 2 has 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 15.
So, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<0, (2, 5, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 3)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<4, (5, 2, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 4)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 3, 8)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 3)>
<7, (6, 8, 4)>
