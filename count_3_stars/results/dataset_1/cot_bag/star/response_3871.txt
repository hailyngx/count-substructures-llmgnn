Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 6
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 8

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
