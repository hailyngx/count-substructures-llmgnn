Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Looking at the list, we can see that nodes 3 and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form using the formula \( 	\binom{n}{3} \).

For node 3:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 8:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
