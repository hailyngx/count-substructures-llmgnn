Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 7.
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 7.
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 4.
- Node 4 has neighbors 3, 7, 9.
- Node 6 has neighbors 5, 7, 8.
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, 6.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 \). 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the final answer is: \[ 6 \] <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>.
