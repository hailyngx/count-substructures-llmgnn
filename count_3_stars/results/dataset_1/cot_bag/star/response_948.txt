Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (3)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (0, 5)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (2, 6)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 3: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, thus \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 6, 9)>.
