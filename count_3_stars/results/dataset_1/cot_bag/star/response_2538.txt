Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
