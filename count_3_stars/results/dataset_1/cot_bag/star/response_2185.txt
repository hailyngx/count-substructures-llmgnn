Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: 0 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: 0 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: 0 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: 1 3-star.
- Node 5: 0 3-stars since it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: 0 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: 0 3-star since it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Therefore, the final result is [6].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<2, (4, 7, 9)> 
<4, (2, 7, 8)> 
<4, (7, 5, 9)> 
<7, (2, 4, 5)> 
<9, (2, 4, 5)> 
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
