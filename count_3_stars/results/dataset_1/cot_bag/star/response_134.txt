Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 3:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10
\]

For node 4:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]

For node 5:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]

For node 6:
\[
\binom{6}{3} = 20
\]

For node 7:
\[
\binom{3}{3} = 1
\]

For node 8:
\[
\binom{3}{3} = 1
\]

Adding these up, we get a total of \(10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 40\) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
