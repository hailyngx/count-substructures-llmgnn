Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given edges:  

```
         1 -- 2
        /      |
       0 - 3   5 - 9
        \  |   | /
           8   6
           |   |
           4   7
```

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  
We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 15 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 3, 8)>  
<1, (0, 3, 7)>  
<1, (2, 3, 7)>  
<1, (3, 0, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 7)>  
<0, (4, 3, 8)>  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<5, (2, 6, 9)>  
<5, (6, 2, 9)>  
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
