Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 = 14 \) which can be represented as [14].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>
<7, (6, 0, 5)>
