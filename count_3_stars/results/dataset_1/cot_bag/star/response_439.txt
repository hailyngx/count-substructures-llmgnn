Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (4, 6, 0)>
