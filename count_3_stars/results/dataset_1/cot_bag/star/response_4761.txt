Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 31 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [31] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>.
