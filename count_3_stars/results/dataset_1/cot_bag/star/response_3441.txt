Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and edges:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 1), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 5 + 4 = 10]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<(1, 9), 5, 6>
<(1, 9), 5, 7>
<(1, 9), 5, 8>
<(1, 9), 5, 2>
<(1, 9), 1, 2>
<(1, 9), 1, 6>
