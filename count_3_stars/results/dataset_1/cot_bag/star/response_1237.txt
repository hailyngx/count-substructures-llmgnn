Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it also does not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 24, and we can list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>,
<3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>,
<4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>,
<5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>,
<7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>,
<9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [24].
