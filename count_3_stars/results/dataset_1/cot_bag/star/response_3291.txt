Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 29.

Therefore, there are 29 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>.

So the final answer is [29].
