Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 5, and 8
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 4, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 6, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
