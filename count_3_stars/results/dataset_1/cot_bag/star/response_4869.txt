Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7. So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 \) 3-stars.  
Thus, the final count is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
