Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Nodes 4 and 5 have 2 neighbors each, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we get a total of 24 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)> (Note: There may be additional 3-stars that were not formed due to nodes having less than 3 neighbors).
