Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 4)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)
- Node 9 (degree 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
