Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the total number of 3-stars can be calculated using the combinatorial formula mentioned earlier.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, node 1 has 4 neighbors, node 2 has 1 neighbor, node 3 has 3 neighbors, node 4 has 2 neighbors, node 5 has 3 neighbors, node 6 has 2 neighbors, node 7 has 5 neighbors, node 8 has 3 neighbors, and node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up:
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20 \)

Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found within <>:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>  

Putting the final number inside brackets gives: [20].
