Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's construct the graph using the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8.

Now let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

For each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [$ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $], so we have <0, (4, 6, 9)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: [$ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $], so we have <3, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: [$ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $], so we have <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 = 12

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
