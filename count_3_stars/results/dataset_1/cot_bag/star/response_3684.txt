Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15 \)

So, there are 15 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
