Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 39

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

Unique 3-stars in the graph are:
