Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are specified between nodes. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

First, let's list the nodes with their degree:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
