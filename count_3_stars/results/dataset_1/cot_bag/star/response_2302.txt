Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 7, and 8. 

Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with 2 as the central node.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 7 as the central node.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with 8 as the central node.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 10 + 10] = 40 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
