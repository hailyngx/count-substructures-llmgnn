Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, with the following edges:

- Node 0 is connected to node 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, and 9 -> 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 9 -> 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 -> 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars using the formula discussed earlier:
\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
- <1, 3, 4, 7>
- <3, 1, 6, 9>
- <6, 2, 7, 8>
