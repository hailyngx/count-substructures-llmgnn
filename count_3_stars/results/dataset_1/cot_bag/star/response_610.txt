Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 2, with neighbors 1, 4, 6, and 8, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: 
  - <2, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
  
- For node 3, with neighbors 6, 7, and 8, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: 
  - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so no other 3-stars are formed.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1] = 5.
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, and <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
