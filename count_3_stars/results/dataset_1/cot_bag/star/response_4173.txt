Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

In total, there are 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
<1, (8, 0, 3)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (8, 1, 9)>
<3, (9, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 8, 6)>
