Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
(0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Let's analyze the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 0 has degree 3.
- Node 1 has degree 3.
- Node 2 has degree 2.
- Node 4 has degree 4.
- Node 5 has degree 2.
- Node 6 has degree 2.
- Node 7 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 2.
- Node 9 has degree 5.

We will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula mentioned earlier. We'll consider nodes with degrees 3 or more. 

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed.
For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed.
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed.
For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [20]\).

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>.
