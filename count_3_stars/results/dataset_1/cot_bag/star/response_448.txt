Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3
Node 1: 0, 3, 5
Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 1
Node 4: 2, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 9
Node 6: 2, 7
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0] = 7. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
