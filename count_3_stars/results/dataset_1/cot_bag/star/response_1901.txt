Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 8, 9)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 8)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 8), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each node.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9), there is only 1 3-star for each node.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8 each contribute 4 3-stars, so \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 2, and 9 each contribute 1 3-star, so \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is \( [16 + 3] = 19 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
