Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 2, 5, and 8.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 8, 9, and 0.
- So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 7.
- So, there is 1 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9, and 2.
- So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>.
