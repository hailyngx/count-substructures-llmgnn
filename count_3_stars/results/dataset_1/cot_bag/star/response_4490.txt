Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For Node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is:
\[ [20 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [38] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
