Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors and identify the 3-stars centered at those nodes.
 
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 2, 8)>.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 5, 8)>.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors.

Node 3 has 1 neighbor.

Node 4 has 1 neighbor.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors.

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 5. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (2, 3, 5)>.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 4. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 1, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4 \). 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, and <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>.
