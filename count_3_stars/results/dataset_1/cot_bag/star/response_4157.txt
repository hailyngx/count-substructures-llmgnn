Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first construct the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7).
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 3: No 3-stars
For Node 7: No 3-stars
For Node 9: No 3-stars

Summing up, there is a total of [1] 3-star in the graph. The unique 3-star is <2, (0, 3, 7)>.
