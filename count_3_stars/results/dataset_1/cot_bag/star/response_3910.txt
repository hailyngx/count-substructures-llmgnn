Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (2)
- Node 1: (2, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 3, 8)
- Node 3: (2, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 4: (1, 3, 5)
- Node 5: (3, 4)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 8)
- Node 8: (2, 6)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 11

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
