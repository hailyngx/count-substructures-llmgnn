Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first as those will form 3-stars.  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 1: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors  
- Node 3: Only 1 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors  
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].  

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (2, 5, 7)>  
<0, (2, 5, 9)>  
<0, (5, 7, 9)>  
<0, (2, 7, 9)>  
<1, (3, 4, 6)>  
<5, (1, 9, 0)>  
<9, (2, 5, 8)>  
<9, (5, 8, 0)>  
<9, (2, 8, 0)>  
<9, (5, 8, 2)>  

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
