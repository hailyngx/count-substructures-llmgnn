Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 21

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
