Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 1)>
