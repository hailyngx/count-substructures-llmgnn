Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 2 and node 4.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2: 
There are 4 neighbors of node 2, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 2.

For node 4:
There are 4 neighbors of node 4, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 4.

Adding these up, we have a total of 8 3-stars in the graph: [8].
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
