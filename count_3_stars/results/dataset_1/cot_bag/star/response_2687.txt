Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 1, 2, and 6.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 = 15.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
