Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors of node 0: nodes 2, 5, and 6.
Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 5, 6)>.

For node 2:
There are 3 neighbors of node 2: nodes 0, 4, and 9.
Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 4, 9)>.

For node 6:
There are 3 neighbors of node 6: nodes 0, 1, and 8.
Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 1, 8)>.

For node 8:
There are 3 neighbors of node 8: nodes 5, 6, and 9.
Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (5, 6, 9)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.

So, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
