Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 6)
(1, 3)
(2, 4), (2, 5)
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 8)
(4, 2), (4, 8)
(5, 2)
(6, 0)
(8, 3), (8, 4)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 1: inom{1}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 (exactly 3 neighbors)
For node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 5: inom{1}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 6: inom{1}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0  (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1]

The unique 3-star found in this graph is: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
