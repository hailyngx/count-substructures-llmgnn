Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to node 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 1
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars originating from them:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors --> 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (less than 3, so no 3-star)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors --> 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

So, there are a total of [2 3-stars] in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
