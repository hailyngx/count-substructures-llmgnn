Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually to make it easier to identify the 3-stars:

```

       0 ---- 4
      / \     |
     /   \    |
    6-----2   1 -- 3
    |     |  /|    |
    |     | / |    |
    5 ----- 8  |
              |
              7 -- 9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: [7]
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 1, 6)>
