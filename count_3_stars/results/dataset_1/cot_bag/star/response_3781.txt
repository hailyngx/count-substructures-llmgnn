Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
With the given information, we first construct the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 2)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 7, 8}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19 [19]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 1, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 1, 7)>
<8, (4, 1, 7)>
<8, (4, 2, 7)>
<8, (4, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
