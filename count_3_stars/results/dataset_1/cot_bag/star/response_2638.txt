Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's see which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 23 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [23]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 7, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 9, 4)>
<6, (3, 0, 4)>
<8, (3, 9, 2)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, 3)>
<9, (8, 7, 5)>
<9, (8, 5, 3)>
<9, (2, 5, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 8, 5)>
<9, (8, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 4)>
<9, (5, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 3)>
<9, (5, 3, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (3, 8, 4)>
