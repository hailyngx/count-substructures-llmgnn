Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 19

So, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
