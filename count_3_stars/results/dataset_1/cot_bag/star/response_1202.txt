Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}.
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
