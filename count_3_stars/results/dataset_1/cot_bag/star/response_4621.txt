Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 0), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5)
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Considering each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>

- Node 1: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 3: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>

- Node 7: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>

- Node 8: Forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
    <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>

- Node 9: Forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
    <9, (1, 3, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [21].
