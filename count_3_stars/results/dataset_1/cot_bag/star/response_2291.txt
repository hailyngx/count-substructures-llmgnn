Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5, 7, and 8 do not have three or more neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1] = 6

Therefore, there are 6 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 8, 7)>
