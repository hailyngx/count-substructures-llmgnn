Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Next, let's determine which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to check for 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the formula mentioned earlier:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>
