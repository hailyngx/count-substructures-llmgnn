Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows: 

Node 0 is connected to node 3.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
Node 6 is connected to node 2.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
Node 8 is connected to node 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: Only one 3-star can be formed with node 1, which is <1, (4, 7, 9)>.
For node 2: There are 2 3-stars with node 2: <2, (4, 5, 7)> and <2, (4, 7, 9)>.
For node 3: Only one 3-star can be formed with node 3, which is <3, (0, 5, 7)>.
For node 4: There are no 3-stars as it is connected to only 3 nodes.
For node 5: There are no 3-stars as it is connected to only 3 nodes.
For node 7: There is 1 3-star with node 7, which is <7, (1, 2, 5)>.
For node 9: There are no 3-stars as it is connected to only 3 nodes.

Thus, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, and <3, (0, 5, 7)>.
