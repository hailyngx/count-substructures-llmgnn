Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with three or more neighbors: node 4, node 7, and node 9.

For node 4:
Since node 4 has 4 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars formed by node 4 are: 
<4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 1, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>.

For node 7:
Similarly, node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
The 3-star formed by node 7 is: 
<7, (0, 3, 4)>.

For node 9:
Since node 9 has 4 neighbors, it can also form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars formed by node 9 are: 
<9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 2, 5)>, <9, (4, 2, 6)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4] = 9.
