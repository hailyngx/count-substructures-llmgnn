Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)> (3 3-stars total).
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)> (3 3-stars total).
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)> (3 3-stars total).

Total number of 3-stars = [6].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
