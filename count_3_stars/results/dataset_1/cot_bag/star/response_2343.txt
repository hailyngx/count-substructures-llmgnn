Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors.  
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.  
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.  

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.  
For node 1:  
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]  
For node 6:  
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) = 8.  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [8].  

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:  
<1, (5, 7, 8)>  
<1, (5, 8, 9)>  
<1, (7, 8, 9)>  
<6, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (2, 8, 9)>  
<6, (4, 8, 9)>  
<6, (8, 9, 1)>  
<6, (8, 9, 5)>
