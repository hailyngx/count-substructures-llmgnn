Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 5. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 3, 4)>
<0, (5, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
