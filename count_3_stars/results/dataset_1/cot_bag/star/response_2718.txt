Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1 is connected to node 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 3, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center are:
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8
Thus, the final count of 3-stars is [8].
