Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can draw the connections between the nodes. The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Below is the visualization of the graph based on the provided edges:

```
   1 -- 3 -- 6 -- 0 -- 2
   |       |    |    |
   9       8    5 -- 4
             |       |
             7       |
                     9
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 8), so there are inom5{3} = 10 3-stars. 
Node 1: Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
Node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 8), forming 1 3-star.
Node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 8), so there are inom4{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7), forming 1 3-star.
Node 5: Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
Node 6: Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 9), so there are inom4{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 7: Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3), forming 1 3-star.
Node 9: Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6), forming 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 21.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
