Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12, which we denote as [12].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 4, 9)>
- <3, (9, 0, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (8, 1, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 3)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
