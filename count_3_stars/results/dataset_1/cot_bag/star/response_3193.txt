Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {1, 6, 7}
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {0, 9}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {4, 5}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 8}
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 4}
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {0, 2}
Node 7 has 1 neighbor: {0}
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: {4, 9}
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 8}

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is the sum of the number of 3-stars at each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 3, 5)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 3)>
<4, (2, 5, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 5)>
<4, (3, 2, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 2)>
<4, (3, 5, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 5)>
