Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5

We can see that only nodes 0, 5, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>

Summing these up, we get a total of 12 3-stars, so the answer is [12].
