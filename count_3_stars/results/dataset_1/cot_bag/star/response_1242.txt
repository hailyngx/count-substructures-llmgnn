Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, and 8: <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 7: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
