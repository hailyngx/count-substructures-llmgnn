Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. From the provided edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 7, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8), hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7), hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8), hence \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6, 9), hence \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 6), hence \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 17.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
