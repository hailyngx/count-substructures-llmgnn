Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. Let's calculate for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 8) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 3) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 9) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 9) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5) - Forms 1 3-star

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>.
