Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 2, and Node 8.
    - There are 1 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 8)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7.
    - There are 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: Node 2, Node 3, Node 9, and another neighbor that doesn't form a 3-star.
    - There are 4 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9.
    - There are 1 3-star: <5, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: Node 2, Node 7, and Node 8.
    - There are 1 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 8)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9.
    - There are 4 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (6, 7, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 15.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (6, 7, 2)>

So the final answer is [15].
