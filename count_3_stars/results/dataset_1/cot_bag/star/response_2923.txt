Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the provided edges, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

1. Node 1: Node 1 has 3 neighbors - 5, 7, 8
   - Number of 3-stars with node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>

2. Node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors - 0, 3, 8
   - Number of 3-stars with node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 8)>

3. Node 3: Node 3 has 3 neighbors - 2, 5, 8
   - Number of 3-stars with node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>

4. Node 5: Node 5 has 4 neighbors - 1, 3, 7, 8
   - Number of 3-stars with node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>

5. Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors - 1, 5, 8, 9
   - Number of 3-stars with node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

6. Node 8: Node 8 has 5 neighbors - 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
   - Number of 3-stars with node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 21

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
