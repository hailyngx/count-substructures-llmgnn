Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 4 = 25.

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
