Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula described earlier:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
  Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
  Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 7)>

- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
  Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 8)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.
