Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors (3, 6, 8, 9)
Node 2: Neighbors (3, 4, 6, 9)
Node 3: Neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7)
Node 4: Neighbors (2, 3)
Node 6: Neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 8)
Node 8: Neighbors (0, 5, 6, 7)
Node 9: Neighbors (0, 2)

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. We have:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

So, there are 26 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets: [26].

Let's now list the unique 3-star configurations found:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

These are the unique 3-star configurations in the graph.
