Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 13 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)> 
<1, (4, 3, 0)>
<2, (9, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 1)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
