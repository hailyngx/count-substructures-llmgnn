Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: There are 3 neighbors of node 1 (nodes 4, 7, 9). So, there is one 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 7, 9)>.

- Node 3: There are 3 neighbors of node 3 (nodes 0, 7, 8). So, there is one 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 7, 8)>.

- Node 4: There are 2 neighbors of node 4 (nodes 1, 6). Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 4.

- Node 6: There are 2 neighbors of node 6 (nodes 2, 4). Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 6.

- Node 7: There are 3 neighbors of node 7 (nodes 1, 3, 8). So, there is one 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 3, 8)>.

- Node 8: There are 3 neighbors of node 8 (nodes 2, 3, 7). So, there is one 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (2, 3, 7)>.

- Node 9: There is only 1 neighbor of node 9 (node 5). Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. The three unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, and <8, (2, 3, 7)>.
