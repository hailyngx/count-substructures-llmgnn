Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {1, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Based on the information provided, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (0, 2, 6): <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 4): <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (2, 3, 5): <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (1, 7, 0): <6, (1, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
