Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges: 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which we will denote as [12]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found: 

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 4)>
<0, (8, 3, 7)>
<8, (9, 0, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 0, 2)>
<9, (7, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 3)>
<9, (0, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [12] <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 4)>, <0, (8, 3, 7)>, <8, (9, 0, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 0, 2)>, <9, (7, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 8, 3)>, <9, (0, 8, 4)>
