Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9), 
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 7), 
(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), 
(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), 
(4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), 
(5, 3), (5, 4), 
(6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 9), 
(7, 1), (7, 8), 
(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), 
(9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Now, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (0, 2, 3)>,  
<3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>,  
<4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 4, 6)>,  
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
