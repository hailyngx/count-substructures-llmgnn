Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors because these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars. Since the graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's list the nodes along with their degree:

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 1
Node 4: Degree 5
Node 5: Degree 1
Node 6: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 1
Node 9: Degree 1

From the degrees, nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7 have three or more neighbors, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these potential central nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22 \). 

Thus, the answer is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
