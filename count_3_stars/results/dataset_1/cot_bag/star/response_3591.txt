Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
   1 --- 9 --- 2
    \         /
     0 --- 4
    / \     / \
   7   5 - 3   6
          \   /
           8
```

The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>.
