Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to follow the steps as outlined above.

First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: neighbors 0, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <1, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (3, 6, 7)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - <3, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <3, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <3, (4, 5, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4] = [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
