Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by determining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 is connected to node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6.

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>.
