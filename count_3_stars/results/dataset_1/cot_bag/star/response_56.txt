Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars with these nodes:
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
