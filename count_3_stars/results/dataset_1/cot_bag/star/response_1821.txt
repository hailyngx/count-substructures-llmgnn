Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 7, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 5)>, <9, (7, 5, 6)>
