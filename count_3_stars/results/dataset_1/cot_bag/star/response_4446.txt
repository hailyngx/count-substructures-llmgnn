Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll look at each node that has three or more neighbors. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \(inom{n}{3}\) where n is the number of neighbors of the node.

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8), so it can form \(inom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (1, 4), which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9 all have 1 or 2 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \(4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13\). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
