Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes 0, 3, and 8 have 5 neighbors
- Nodes 1 and 9 have 4 neighbors
- Nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7 have 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes 0, 3, and 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- Nodes 1 and 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
