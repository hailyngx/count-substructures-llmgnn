Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
Node 7 is connected to node 0.
Node 8 is connected to node 2.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: There are 2 3-stars.
For node 1: There are 3 3-stars.
For node 2: There are 3 3-stars.
For node 3: There is 1 3-star.
For node 4: There is 1 3-star.
For node 5: There are 4 3-stars.
For node 6: There is 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
