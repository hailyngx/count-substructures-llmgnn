Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 8, 9).
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7).
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 9).
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 8, 9).
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9).
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 7, 8).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
