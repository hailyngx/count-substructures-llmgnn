Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There is only 1 3-star that can be formed using node 4 as it has exactly 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 7, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
