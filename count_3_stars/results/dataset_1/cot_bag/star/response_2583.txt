Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (0, 4, 5)>

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 9)>
<2, (8, 3, 9)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 3, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 4, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 4)>
<3, (9, 4, 5)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 1, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 25
So, the total number of 3-stars is [25].
