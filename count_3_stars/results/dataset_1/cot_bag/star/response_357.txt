Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in the graph. Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 7, 8, 9) -- Forms 1 3-star
Node 1: 2 neighbors (3, 5) -- No 3-star formed
Node 2: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9) -- Forms 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 neighbor (1) -- No 3-star formed
Node 4: 2 neighbors (2, 5) -- No 3-star formed
Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9) -- Forms 1 3-star
Node 6: 2 neighbors (7, 9) -- No 3-star formed
Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 6, 8, 9) -- Forms 1 3-star
Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 9) -- Forms 1 3-star
Node 9: 6 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8) -- Forms 4 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [8] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
