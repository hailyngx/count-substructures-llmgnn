Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
0 --- 3
|  X  |
|  |  |
5 --- 2 --- 4 --- 7
|  X  |  X  |
|  |  |  |  |
8 --- 9   6 --- 1
```

Now, let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 8, 9). So there are [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 9). So there are [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>

Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 5). There's only 1 3-star formed: <4, (2, 7, 5)>

Node 5: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 7, 9). So there are [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars:
<5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>

Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (1, 2). Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 7: It has 2 neighbors (4, 5). Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 8: It has 2 neighbors (0, 9). Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8). There's only 1 3-star formed: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 14 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
