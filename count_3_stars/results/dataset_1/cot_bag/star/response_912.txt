Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes have the following neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: no 3-star
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: no 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1] = [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
