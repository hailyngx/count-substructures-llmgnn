Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 1, 6, 9, 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.

Thus, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 6)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<9, (5, 0, 4)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
