Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0 -- 7
    | 
    7 -- 0

    2 -- 9
    | 
    9 -- 2

    3 -- 6
    | 
    6 -- 3

    4 -- 6 -- 8
    |    |    |
    8    4 -- 9
         |    |
         9 -- 4

    5 -- 6 -- 9
         |    |
         9 -- 5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 4, 6, 9

Total number of 3-stars:
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 3-star)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 9) = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
