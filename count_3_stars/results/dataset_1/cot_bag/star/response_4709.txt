Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.
Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: [3]
- Node 1: [5, 6, 7, 9]
- Node 2: [3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 3: [0, 2, 4, 9]
- Node 4: [2, 3, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 5: [1, 6, 9]
- Node 6: [1, 5, 8, 9]
- Node 7: [1, 2, 4, 9]
- Node 8: [2, 4, 6]
- Node 9: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

We see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 2: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 3: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 4: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 7: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 9: [7 choose 3] = 35

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 35 = 77

Therefore, there are 77 3-stars in the given graph. 

Putting this inside brackets, we have: [77].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>.
