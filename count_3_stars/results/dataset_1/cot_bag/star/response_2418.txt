Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 10 nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the neighbors of each node to determine the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: Only has 1 neighbor (node 7), so no 3-star is formed.
Node 1: Neighbors are nodes 2, 8, and 9. This forms one 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>.
Node 2: Neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9. This forms five 3-stars: <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>.
Node 3: Neighbors are nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8. This forms one 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 5)>.
Node 4: Only has 1 neighbor (node 3), so no 3-star is formed.
Node 5: Only has 1 neighbor (node 3), so no 3-star is formed.
Node 6: Neighbors are nodes 8 and 9. This forms one 3-star: <6, (8, 9, x)> where x represents an unknown node.
Node 7: Neighbors are nodes 0, 2, and 8. This forms one 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 8)>.
Node 8: Neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. This forms five 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>.
Node 9: Neighbors are nodes 1, 2, and 6. This forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 6)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1] = 14.
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
