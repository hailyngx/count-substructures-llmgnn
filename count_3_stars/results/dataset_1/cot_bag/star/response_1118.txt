Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
With the given information, let's first list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7)
Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 9)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>
