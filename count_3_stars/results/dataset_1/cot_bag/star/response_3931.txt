Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph:

```
      0
     /|\
    4 6 9
     \|
      1
     //|
    2  5
         \
          3
           |
           8
           |
           9
```

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: C(3,3) = 1 3-star
- Node 1: C(3,3) = 1 3-star
- Node 6: C(6,3) = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 6, 9>
- <1, 2, 5, 6>
- <6, 0, 1, 2>
- <6, 0, 1, 4>
- <6, 0, 1, 5>
- <6, 0, 1, 7>
- <6, 0, 2, 4>
- <6, 0, 2, 5>
- <6, 0, 2, 7>
- <6, 0, 4, 5>
- <6, 0, 4, 7>
- <6, 0, 5, 7>
- <6, 1, 2, 4>
- <6, 1, 2, 5>
- <6, 1, 2, 7>
- <6, 1, 4, 5>
- <6, 1, 4, 7>
- <6, 1, 5, 7>
- <6, 2, 4, 5>
- <6, 2, 4, 7>
- <6, 2, 5, 7>
