Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to first find the nodes that have at least three neighbors. Here are the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 (Degree: 5)
- Node 1: 0, 8 (Degree: 2)
- Node 2: 0, 6 (Degree: 2)
- Node 3: 5 (Degree: 1)
- Node 4: 7, 9 (Degree: 2)
- Node 5: 0, 3 (Degree: 2)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 7: 4, 6 (Degree: 2)
- Node 8: 1 (Degree: 1)
- Node 9: 0, 4 (Degree: 2)

From the list above, Node 0 and Node 6 have degrees greater than or equal to 3, which means they can potentially form 3-stars.

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 5)>
- <6, (2, 7, 4)>
- <6, (7, 4, 9)>

Counting the 3-stars formed with Node 0 and Node 6 gives us a total of 8 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
