Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to analyze each node's neighborhood and identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we can count the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

Here is the information on the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors - 3
- Node 1: Neighbors - 2, 3
- Node 2: Neighbors - 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors - 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors - 2, 3
- Node 5: Neighbors - 7
- Node 6: Neighbors - 8
- Node 7: Neighbors - 5
- Node 8: Neighbors - 6, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors - 2, 3, 8

From the above information, we see that nodes 2, 3, and 9 have more than three neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars associated with these nodes:

For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 9, 8)>
<3, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)> 

Thus, the final count is [6].
