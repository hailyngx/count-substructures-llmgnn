Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's build the graph based on the given information.

The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 1 and Node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 0, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 3 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

There are a total of \( 4 + 4 = 8 \) 3-stars formed in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [8]
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
