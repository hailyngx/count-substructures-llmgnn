Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To begin, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 3: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 6: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 9: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: $4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 25$

Putting this final number inside brackets: [25]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 3)>
