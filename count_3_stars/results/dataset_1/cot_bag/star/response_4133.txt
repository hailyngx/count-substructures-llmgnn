Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 0: <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 1: <1, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 2: <2, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8 (Note: 4 is not counted here as it's the center node)
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 9)>, <4, (8, 0, 9)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 2)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2 (Note: 7 is not counted here as it's the center node)
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 2
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17]. The unique 3-stars are: <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 9)>, <4, (8, 0, 9)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>.
