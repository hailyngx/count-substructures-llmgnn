Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the edge list, the graph can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 4), (9, 6)}

For each node with three or more neighbors, we can determine the number of 3-stars it participates in. Let's go through each such node:

- Node 1: Is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
  
- Node 2: Is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
  
- Node 3: Is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
  
- Node 4: Is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
  
- Node 5: Is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
  
- Node 6: Is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 8: Is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>
  
- Node 9: Is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
  
Thus, there is a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [6].
