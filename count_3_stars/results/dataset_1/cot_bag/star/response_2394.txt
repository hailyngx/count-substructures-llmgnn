Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [40].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>
