Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 11 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
