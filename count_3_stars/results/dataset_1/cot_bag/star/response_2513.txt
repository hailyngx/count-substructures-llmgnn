Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough for a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40 \]

Therefore, there are 40 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
