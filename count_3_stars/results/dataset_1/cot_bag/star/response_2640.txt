Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges. 

The connections are:
- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the formula mentioned earlier.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors and the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31

So, there are 31 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get: [31].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, 2, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 9>, <4, 6, 8>, <6, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 9> 

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
