Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 6. No 3-star can be formed.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 7.
- Number of 3-stars = 1
- Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
