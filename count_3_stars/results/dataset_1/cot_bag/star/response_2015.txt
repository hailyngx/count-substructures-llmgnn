Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the qualifying nodes:  
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each  
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Total number of 3-stars = \( 6 \times 4 + 1 = 25 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].  

Let's list the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (1, 2, 5)>  
<0, (1, 2, 9)>  
<0, (1, 5, 7)>  
<0, (2, 5, 9)>  
<1, (0, 2, 3)>  
<1, (0, 2, 5)>  
<1, (0, 2, 7)>  
<1, (2, 3, 9)>  
<1, (2, 5, 7)>  
<1, (3, 5, 7)>  
<2, (0, 1, 7)>  
<2, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 9)>  
<3, (1, 2, 7)>  
<3, (1, 7, 9)>  
<3, (2, 7, 9)>  
<7, (0, 1, 2)>  
<7, (0, 1, 3)>  
<7, (0, 2, 3)>  
<7, (1, 3, 4)>  
<9, (0, 2, 3)>  
<9, (0, 3, 6)>  
<9, (2, 3, 6)>  
<9, (3, 6, 7)>  
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
