Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 6), 
(1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), 
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9), 
(3, 2), (3, 6), 
(4, 8), 
(5, 1), (5, 2), 
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 9), 
(8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9), 
(9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 1: There are 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6). So, there are C(3, 3) = 1 3-star.
For node 1: <1, (0, 5, 6)>

For node 2: There are 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9). So, there are C(3, 3) = 1 3-star.
For node 2: <2, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 6: There are 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 8, 9). So, there are C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
For node 6: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 8: There are 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9). So, there are C(3, 3) = 1 3-star.
For node 8: <8, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 9: There are 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8). So, there are C(3, 3) = 1 3-star.
For node 9: <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [14].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>
