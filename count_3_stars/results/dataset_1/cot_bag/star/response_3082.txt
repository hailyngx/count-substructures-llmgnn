Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 2:
The 3-stars involving Node 2 are: 
    - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 9)>

For Node 6:
The 3-stars involving Node 6 are: 
    - <6, (1, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
