Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 5)

Now, let's analyze the nodes and determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (5, 7) - No 3-star formed.
- Node 1: Has 2 neighbors (4, 8) - No 3-star formed.
- Node 2: Has 2 neighbors (3, 9) - No 3-star formed.
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6) - Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: Has 2 neighbors (1, 3) - No 3-star formed.
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 8, 9) - Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: Has 2 neighbors (3, 8) - No 3-star formed.
- Node 7: Has 2 neighbors (0, 8) - No 3-star formed.
- Node 8: Has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7) - Total 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 9: Has 2 neighbors (2, 5) - No 3-star formed.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4] = 12.

Thus, the final representation is [12].
