Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors: node 0, node 2, node 3, node 6, and node 9. 

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 29 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [29], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
