Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1 -- 6 -- 5
    |    |    |
    7 -- 2 -- 3
    |         |
    0 -- 9    4 -- 8
```

By examining each node, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1] = [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
