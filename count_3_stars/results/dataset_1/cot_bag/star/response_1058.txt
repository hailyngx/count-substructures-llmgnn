Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 8: 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
There are 5 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8, there are no 3-stars possible as they only have 1 neighbor each.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 10, which we'll put inside brackets: [10].

The unique 3-star that can be formed with node 2 as the center is: <2, (0, 3, 5)>.
