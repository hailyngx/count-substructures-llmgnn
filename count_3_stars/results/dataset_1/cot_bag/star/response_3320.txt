Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 \).

Therefore, the answer is: \[ [22] \]

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 4)>, <0, (8, 9, 5)>, <0, (9, 2, 4)>, <0, (9, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 3, 0)>, <4, (7, 3, 5)>, <4, (7, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 0, 4)>, <5, (1, 0, 6)>.
