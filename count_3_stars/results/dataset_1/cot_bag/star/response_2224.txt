Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\[1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 26\]

So, there are 26 3-stars in total.
Therefore, the final answer is [26].

Below are the unique 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
