Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>
