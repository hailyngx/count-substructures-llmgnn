Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

We see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, thus potentially forming a 3-star.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each qualified node:
- Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 1)>
<6, (1, 0, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 0, 5)>
