Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 37

This gives us a total of [37] 3-stars in the graph.

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
4. <2, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
6. <2, (6, 7, 9)>
7. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
8. <6, (2, 4, 7)>
9. <6, (7, 8, 9)>
10. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
11. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
12. <9, (6, 7, 8)>
