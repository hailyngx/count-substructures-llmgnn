Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 19 \) 3-stars.

So, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in this graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
