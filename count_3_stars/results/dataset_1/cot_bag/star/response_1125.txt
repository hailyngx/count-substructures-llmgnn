Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: {4, 7, 8}
Node 1: {2, 9}
Node 2: {1, 3}
Node 3: {2, 7, 9}
Node 4: {0, 7}
Node 5: {8}
Node 6: {7, 8}
Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 8: {0, 5, 6}
Node 9: {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [14]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
