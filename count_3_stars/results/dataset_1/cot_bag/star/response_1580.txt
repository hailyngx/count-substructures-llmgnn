Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

For node 0: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 1: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (2, 5, 9)>

For node 2: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (1, 3, 4)>

For node 3: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 4: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (0, 2, 7)>

For node 5: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<5, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 7: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 1)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>

For node 8: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 1)>

For node 9: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is  36  and the unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 1)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
