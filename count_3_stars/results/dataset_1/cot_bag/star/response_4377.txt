Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Based on the description of the graph provided, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 2)}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8. So, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
  <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>
  
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7. So, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
  <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>
  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 9. So, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
  <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8. So, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
  <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>
  
- The rest of the nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with those nodes.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
