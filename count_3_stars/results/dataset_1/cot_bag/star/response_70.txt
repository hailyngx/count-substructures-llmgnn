Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by drawing the graph described:
        
        ```
        0 -- 1
        |    |
        2 -- 4 -- 7
            |    |
            8 -- 5
        ```
        
        Based on this graph, let's identify the 3-stars:
        Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4).
        Node 2 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it cannot form a 3-star.
        Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8, 2).
        Node 8 has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 7, 0).
        
        Calculating the number of 3-stars:
        - For node 0, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
        - For node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
        - For node 8, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
        
        So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 10] = [15] \).
        
        Listing the unique 3-stars:
