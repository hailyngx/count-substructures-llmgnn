Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in the graph. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 9
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>

Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 0
No 3-star can be formed with node 1.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8
No 3-star can be formed with node 2.

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 8, 9
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8
No 3-star can be formed with node 4.

Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 7
No 3-star can be formed with node 5.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
No 3-star can be formed with node 8.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].
