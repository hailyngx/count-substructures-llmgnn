Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with less than three neighbors: node 0 and node 1, so they won't form any 3-stars. 

Now, let's look at nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {3, 6, 7, 9}. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (3, 6, 7)>,  <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>.

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {2, 9}, and it will not form any 3-stars.

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {7, 8, 9}. So, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 8, 9)>.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {6, 8, 9}. So, there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 8, 9)>.

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {2, 5, 9}. So, there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 5, 9)>.

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 9}. So, there is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (2, 4, 9)>.

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 5}. So, there is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (0, 4, 5)>.

- Node 9 has 8 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. So, there are \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center. These 3-stars are <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, ..., <9, (5, 8, 7)>. 

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 56 = 64 \) 3-stars.

So, the answer is [64].
