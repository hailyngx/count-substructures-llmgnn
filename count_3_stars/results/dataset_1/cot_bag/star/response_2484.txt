Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around each node that has three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
