Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 2, 4, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, while nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 have 3 neighbors each.

For nodes with 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 9):
Number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of unique 3-stars for these nodes: \( 3 \times 10 = 30 \)

For nodes with 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, 6, 7):
Number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Number of unique 3-stars for these nodes: \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 30 + 4 = 34 \).

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 3)>
<7, (2, 9, 5)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [34].
