Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,4), (2,7), (3,9), (4,2), (5,6), (5,9), (6,1), (6,5), (6,9), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,3), (9,5), (9,6)

Next, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (6, 7, 8, 9) -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 9, 7) -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6) -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, and <9, (1, 3, 5)>.
