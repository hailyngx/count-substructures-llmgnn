Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1, node 2, and node 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 \), so the final count is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
