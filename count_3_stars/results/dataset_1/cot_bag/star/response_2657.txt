Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 68

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
