Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 5, and node 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

So, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
