Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (4, 8)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (0, 3)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (0, 1)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1]

Unique 3-star found: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
