Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0 and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

[${1 + 4 = 5}$]

<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 9, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>
