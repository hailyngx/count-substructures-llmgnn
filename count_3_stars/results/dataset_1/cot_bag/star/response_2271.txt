Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 36 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
