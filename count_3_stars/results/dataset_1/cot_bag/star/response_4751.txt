Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges.

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {1, 7}
- 1: {0, 5, 6}
- 3: {5, 9}
- 5: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- 6: {1, 9}
- 7: {0}
- 8: {5}
- 9: {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1:
- 3-stars: [1]
   <1, (0, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
- 3-stars: [2]
   <5, (1, 3, 8)>
   <5, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
