Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars and list them as requested, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars they form. Here are the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors
Node 1 has 4 neighbors
Node 2 has 5 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 6 neighbors
Node 6 has 5 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 4 neighbors
Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 60 \) 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
