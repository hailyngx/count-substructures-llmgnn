Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars formed with that node and then find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 0 does not form any 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: 1 does not form any 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 2: 2 does not form any 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 3: 3 forms 1 3-star with leaves {1, 5, 6}.
- Node 5: 5 forms 1 3-star with leaves {0, 7, 8}.
- Node 6: 6 forms 1 3-star with leaves {9, 8, 3}.
- Node 7: 7 does not form any 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 8: 8 does not form any 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9: 9 does not form any 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-star structures are: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, and <6, (9, 8, 3)>. 

Therefore, the final result is [3].
