Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. 

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. So, it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, and 9. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, and 6. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 35 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [45].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>.
