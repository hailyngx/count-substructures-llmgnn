Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 5), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 5), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6) 

Now, let's determine the 3-star structures in this graph:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9
   - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3
   - inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 9
    - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6
    - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

So, the final answer is [14]. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>
