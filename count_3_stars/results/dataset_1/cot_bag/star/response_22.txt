Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: Does not form a 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 2, and 5. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 6. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 3: Does not form a 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 6. <5, (1, 2, 6)>
Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 5. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
Node 7: Does not form a 3-star since it has 5 neighbors.
Node 8: Does not form a 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
Node 9: Does not form a 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.

So, the 3-stars in the graph are <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>. This gives a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
