Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
(0, 3), (0, 8)
(1, 2), (1, 9)
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7)
(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4)
(4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8)
(5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 9)
(6, 8)
(7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9)
(8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 6)
(9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors.

For Node 2:
Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (1, 3, 7)>

For Node 3:
Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<3, (0, 2, 4)>

For Node 4:
Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 5)>

For Node 7:
Number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

For Node 8:
Number of 3-stars with Node 8 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<8, (0, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
