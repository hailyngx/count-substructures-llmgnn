Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {5, 8}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [10] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
