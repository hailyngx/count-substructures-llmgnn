Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 1)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (2, 9, 0)>
- <9, (3, 7, 0)>
