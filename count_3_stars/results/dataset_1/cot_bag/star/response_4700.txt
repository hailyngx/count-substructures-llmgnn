Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to node 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 9
- Node 6 is connected to node 1
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
