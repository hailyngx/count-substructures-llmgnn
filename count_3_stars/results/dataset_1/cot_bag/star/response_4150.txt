Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 5.

Now we'll identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is part of the 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)> [3]
- No 3-stars for Node 1
- Node 2 is part of the 3-stars: <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)> [2]
- No 3-stars for Node 3
- Node 4 is part of the 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)> [3]
- Node 5 is part of the 3-stars: <5, (4, 8, 9)> [1]
- Node 6 is part of the 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 8)> [1]
- Node 7 is part of the 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 4)> [1]
- Node 8 is part of the 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 6)> [1]
- No 3-stars for Node 9

Total number of 3-stars: [3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [12]
