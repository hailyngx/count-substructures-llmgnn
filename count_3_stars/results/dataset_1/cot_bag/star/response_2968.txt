Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors first:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6 have three or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 0 3-stars. So, the final answer is [0].
