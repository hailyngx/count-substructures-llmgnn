Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9

For node 0:
Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 3:
Since node 3 has 4 neighbors, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 4:
Since node 4 has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.

For node 9:
Since node 9 has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of [4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 10 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 3)>
<9, (3, 8, 8)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
