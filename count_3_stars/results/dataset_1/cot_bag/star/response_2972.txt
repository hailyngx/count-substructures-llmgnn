Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
