Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors and is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>

<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
