Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 6), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
