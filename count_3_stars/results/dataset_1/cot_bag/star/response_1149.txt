Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 20 + 1 + 10] = 32

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
