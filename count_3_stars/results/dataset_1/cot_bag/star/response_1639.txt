Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4] = [13] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 0)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
