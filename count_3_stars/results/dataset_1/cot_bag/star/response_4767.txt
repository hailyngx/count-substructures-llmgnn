Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars

Node 9 has only 3 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 36 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36]. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6, 5)>
- <0, (3, 9, 5)>
- <0, (5, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 5)>
- <2, (3, 9, 8)>
- <2, (7, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 9, 5)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (9, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 5)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 7, 1)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 0, 7)>
- <5, (7, 9, 3)>
- <5, (9, 7, 3)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (4, 5, 2)>
- <7, (5, 3, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 0)>
- <7, (5, 9, 3)>
- <7, (9, 5, 3)>
