Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>.
