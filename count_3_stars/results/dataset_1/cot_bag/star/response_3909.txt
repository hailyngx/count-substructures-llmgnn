Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually so we can better analyze it.

The graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges can be illustrated as follows:

```
  1 --- 3         7
 /|\    |        / \
0 | 5   |       1 - 8
 \|/    |       |   |  
  9 --- 2 --- 4 - 6
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Degree = 4
Number of 3-stars = C(4, 3) = 4

Node 1: Degree = 5
Number of 3-stars = C(5, 3) = 10

Node 2: Degree = 2 => No 3-star

Node 3: Degree = 1 => No 3-star

Node 4: Degree = 3
Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 5: Degree = 2 => No 3-star

Node 6: Degree = 2 => No 3-star

Node 7: Degree = 2 => No 3-star

Node 8: Degree = 3
Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 9: Degree = 3
Number of 3-stars = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 1, 8>
<1, 3, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 0, 8>
<1, 5, 0, 9>
<1, 5, 8, 9>
<1, 7, 8, 9>
<1, 8, 0, 9>
<2, 4, 6, 9>
<8, 0, 5, 9>
<9, 0, 1, 2>
