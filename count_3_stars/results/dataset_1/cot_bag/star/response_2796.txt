Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 3 and 9.
- Node 6 has neighbors 8 and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbors 5 and 6.
- Node 9 has neighbors 1, 6, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
The unique 3-star found in this graph is <9, (1, 6, 7)>.
