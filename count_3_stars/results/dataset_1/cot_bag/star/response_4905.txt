Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes.

Node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
Node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
Node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
Node 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars
Node 6: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$ 3-stars
Node 8: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
Node 9: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: $4+4+1+10+0+1+1 = 21$ 

So, there are 21 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, and <5, (6, 8, 9)>.
