Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 30 \). 
Putting this final number inside brackets [] gives us [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
