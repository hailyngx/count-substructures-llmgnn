Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, which could potentially form 3-stars.
Here are the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: It has 3 neighbors. So, the number of 3-stars originating from Node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For Node 4: It has 3 neighbors. So, the number of 3-stars originating from Node 4 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 = 2. 

Therefore, the final answer is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, and <4, (1, 3, 6)>.
