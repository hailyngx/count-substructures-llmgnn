Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
