Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 2:
- Since Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4), there is 1 3-star formed: <2, (0, 3, 4)>

For Node 4:
- Since Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6), there is 1 3-star formed: <4, (2, 5, 6)>

For Node 5:
- Since Node 5 has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 9), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed: 
  - <5, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <5, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <5, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <5, (4, 7, 9)>

For Node 7:
- Since Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 8, 9), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed: 
  - <7, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <7, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <7, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <7, (3, 8, 9)>

Combining all the 3-stars found, we have: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
