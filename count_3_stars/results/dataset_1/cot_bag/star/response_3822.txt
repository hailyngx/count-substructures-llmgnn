Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- For Node 1: It forms 1 3-star.
    - <1, (3, 5, 8)>

- For Node 3: It forms 4 3-stars.
    - <3, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (5, 7, 8)>

- For Node 5: It forms 1 3-star.
    - <5, (1, 4, 7)>

- For Node 7: It forms 1 3-star.
    - <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 7.
