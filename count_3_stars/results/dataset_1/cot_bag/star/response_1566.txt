Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the details of the graph, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <0, (3, 6, 7)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (0, 6, 7)>
  <3, (6, 7, 9)>
  <3, (0, 6, 9)>
  <3, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <6, (0, 3, 7)>
  <6, (0, 1, 9)>
  <6, (3, 6, 7)>
  <6, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <7, (2, 3, 6)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <9, (3, 6, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1] = [11] \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 11.
