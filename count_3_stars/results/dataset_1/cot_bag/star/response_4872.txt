Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

No 3-star configurations are formed for the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 0, which we represent as [0].
