Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node and identify how many 3-stars are formed around it.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 9. Using \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \), we see that node 0 can form 1 3-star.

2. Node 1 has 1 neighbor (node 0), so it cannot form any 3-star.

3. Node 2 has only 1 neighbor (node 7), so it cannot form any 3-star.

4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 7. It cannot form any 3-star.

5. Node 4 has 1 neighbor (node 0), so it cannot form any 3-star.

6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor (node 8), so it cannot form any 3-star.

7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 7. It cannot form any 3-star.

8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. Using \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \), we see that node 7 can form 10 3-stars.

9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, and 9. Using \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \), we see that node 8 can form 1 3-star.

10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, and 8. Using \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \), we see that node 9 can form 1 3-star.

In total, we have 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, and <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
