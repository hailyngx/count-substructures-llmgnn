Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

Edges: 
(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8),
(2, 5), (2, 7),
(3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 7),
(4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7),
(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7),
(6, 5),
(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5),
(8, 1)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with neighbors:
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor

Number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>
