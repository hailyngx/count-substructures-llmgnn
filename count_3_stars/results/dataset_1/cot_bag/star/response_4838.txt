Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. This will help us determine the number of 3-stars each node forms.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding these up: \(10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32\)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
