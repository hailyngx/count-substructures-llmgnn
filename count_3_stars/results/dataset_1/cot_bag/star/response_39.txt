Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and based on the given edges the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

We can now calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>
