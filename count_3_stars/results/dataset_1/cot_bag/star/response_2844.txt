Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
   Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>

3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9
   Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>

4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
   Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 9)>

6. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
   Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>

9. Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
   Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].
