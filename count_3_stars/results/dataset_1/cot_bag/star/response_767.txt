Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 17 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 0, 9)>
<4, (8, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 0, 9)>
<7, (3, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
