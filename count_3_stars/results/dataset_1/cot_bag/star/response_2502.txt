Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 4, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4 (4 neighbors)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
