Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 46 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 0, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
