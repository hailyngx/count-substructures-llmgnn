Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's look at the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 9
Node 1: 8, 9
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 0, 7
Node 4: 5, 6
Node 5: 4, 7
Node 6: 2, 4
Node 7: 3, 5
Node 8: 1, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 6: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of [0] 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <>
