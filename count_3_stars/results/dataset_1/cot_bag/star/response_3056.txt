Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 6, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 5, 6
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 6, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 2, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors 6
- Node 8 has neighbors 4
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 0, 7)>
<6, (5, 2, 4)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 0, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
