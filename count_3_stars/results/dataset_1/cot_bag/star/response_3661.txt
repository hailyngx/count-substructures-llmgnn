Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 20 (from node 8) = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].
The unique 3-stars are:
