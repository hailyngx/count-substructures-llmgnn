Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, providing 1 3-star with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, giving 1 3-star with node 2 as the center.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, yielding 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, producing 10 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, generating \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding up all the 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>
