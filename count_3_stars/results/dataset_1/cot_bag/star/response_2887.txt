Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first write down the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-star graphs:

For node 1, we have inom(2, 3) = 0 3-stars
For node 3, we have inom(3, 3) = 1 3-star: <3, (4, 9, 6)>
For node 4, we have inom(3, 3) = 1 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
For node 9, we have inom(3, 3) = 1 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [0 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 3, and the unique 3-stars are <3, (4, 9, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, and <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
