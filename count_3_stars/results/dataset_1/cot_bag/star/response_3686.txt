Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together gives a total of 20 3-stars in this graph: [20].
The unique 3-stars are:
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
