Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>
