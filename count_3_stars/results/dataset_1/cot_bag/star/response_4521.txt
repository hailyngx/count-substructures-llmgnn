Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].

And the unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 1, 7)>, <0, (6, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 0)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>.
