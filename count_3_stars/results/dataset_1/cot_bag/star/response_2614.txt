Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with the number of their neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 1 neighbor
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 2 neighbors
Node 7: 1 neighbor
Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
