Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

From the above analysis, we see that Node 5 and Node 8 have 4 and 3 neighbors respectively, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 8:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Therefore, total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

So, the final answer is [5] and the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 0, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<5, (8, 0, 2)>
<5, (8, 2, 0)>
