Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: There is only 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors. <4, (1, 8, 5)>
- For node 5: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- For node 7: <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: <9, (2, 7, 1)>

Adding these up, we get a total of [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 8, 5)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 1)>
So, the final answer is [18].
