Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 0), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 9), (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7)}

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 7}
   Total 3-stars with node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
   Unique 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 7)>

2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {5, 9}
   No 3-stars with node 1.

3. Node 2 has 1 neighbor: {0}
   No 3-stars with node 2.

4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor: {9}
   No 3-stars with node 3.

5. Node 4 has 1 neighbor: {8}
   No 3-stars with node 4.

6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor: {1}
   No 3-stars with node 5.

7. Node 6 has 1 neighbor: {0}
   No 3-stars with node 6.

8. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {0, 9}
   No 3-stars with node 7.

9. Node 8 has 1 neighbor: {4}
   No 3-stars with node 8.

10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 7}
   Total 3-stars with node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
   Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>.
