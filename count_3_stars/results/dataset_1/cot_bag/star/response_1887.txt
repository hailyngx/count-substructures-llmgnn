Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 24

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
