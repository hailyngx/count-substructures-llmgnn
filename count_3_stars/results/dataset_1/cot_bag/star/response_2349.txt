Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
