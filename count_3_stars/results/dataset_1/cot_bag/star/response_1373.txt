Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have \( 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 23 \) 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
