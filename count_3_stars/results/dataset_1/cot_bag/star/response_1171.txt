Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are five nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 58\). So we put this number inside brackets: [58].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 6)>
