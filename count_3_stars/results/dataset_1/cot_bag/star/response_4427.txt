Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 35 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
