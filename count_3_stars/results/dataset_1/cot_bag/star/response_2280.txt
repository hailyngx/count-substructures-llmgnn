Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {8}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 7)>.
Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 7)>,  <4, (5, 6, 9)>,  <4, (6, 7, 9)>,  <4, (5, 7, 9)>.
Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 6)>,  <5, (3, 4, 7)>,  <5, (4, 6, 7)>,  <5, (6, 4, 7)>.
Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 5)>,  <6, (1, 4, 9)>,  <6, (4, 5, 7)>,  <6, (5, 4, 7)>.
Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 5)>.
Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [15], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>.
