Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
Node 0: 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 6, 7
Node 3: 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 7, 8
Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 0, 5

Based on the neighbors of each node, we can see that only nodes 5 and 6 have three or more neighbors, and can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 = 20.

The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].
