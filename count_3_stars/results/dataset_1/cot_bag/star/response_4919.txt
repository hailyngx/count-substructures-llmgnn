Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will go through each node that has three or more neighbors and see how many 3-stars can be formed around them.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 9), so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 0.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7, 9), so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 2.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9), so we can form 1 3-star around node 3.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8), so we can form 1 3-star around node 4.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars around node 9.

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 36 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 3, 1)>
<9, (0, 5, 1)>
<9, (0, 8, 1)>
<9, (1, 3, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 2)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 5)>
<9, (5, 8, 8)>
