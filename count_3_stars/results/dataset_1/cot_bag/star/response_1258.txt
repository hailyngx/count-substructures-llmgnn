Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
      0 -- 3 -- 5 -- 8
     / \   |   |   |
    4   1  2   7   6
         \ |  /|  /|
           9   4--7   
```

Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <3, (4, 0, 5)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (7, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 3, 7)>
- <5, (3, 0, 1)>
- <5, (3, 2, 9)>
- <5, (5, 4, 7)>
- <5, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (5, 3, 4)>
- <7, (7, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 1, 3)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (7, 6, 4)>
- <9, (7, 6, 9)>
