Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors so we can calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
