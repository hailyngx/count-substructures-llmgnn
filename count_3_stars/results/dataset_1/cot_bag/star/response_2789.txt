Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can construct the graph with the nodes and edges as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0,7), (0,8), (1,3), (1,5), (1,8), (2,4), (3,1), (3,6), (3,8), 
       (4,2), (4,5), (4,7), (5,1), (5,4), (5,8), (6,3), (7,0), (7,4), (7,9), 
       (8,0), (8,1), (8,3), (8,5), (9,7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star formed with that node.
For nodes with more than 3 neighbors (degree >= 3), we use the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>
