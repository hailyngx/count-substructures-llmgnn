Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 5

Node 1: 2, 4, 5

Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 9

Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 9

Node 4: 1, 3

Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9

Node 7: 3, 5, 8

Node 8: 5, 7

Node 9: 2, 3, 5

We'll now calculate the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 35 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [35].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
