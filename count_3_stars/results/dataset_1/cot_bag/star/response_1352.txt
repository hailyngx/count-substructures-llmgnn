Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now let's calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of 9 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>, <3, (9, 8, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 2)>, <8, (3, 9, 5)>, <9, (3, 8, 5)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
