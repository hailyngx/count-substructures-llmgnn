Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 2, 7

Let's calculate the 3-stars now:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)> 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)> 

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars. So, the final count is [8].
