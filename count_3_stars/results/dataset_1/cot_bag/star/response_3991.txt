Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first represent the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4
Node 2: 6, 9
Node 3: 4, 5
Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 4
Node 9: 2, 4

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4
Nodes with 4 neighbors: None
Nodes with 5 neighbors: None

For the node with 3 neighbors (node 4), we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is: <4, (0, 3, 7)>
