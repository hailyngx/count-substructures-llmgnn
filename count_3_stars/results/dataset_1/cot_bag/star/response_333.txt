Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 9
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

There are 9 nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 49

So, there are 49 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>.

Therefore, the final result is [49].
