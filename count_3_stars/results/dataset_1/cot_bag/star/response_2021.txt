Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the edges are specified as you provided. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 9. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 9. So, it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8. So, it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [13].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
