Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the provided edges:

```

   0 ---- 2          5
         |
   1 -- 3 -- 4       6 -- 9
        |        \  |
        7  8       \|  

```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [19] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 3, 6)>
- <1, (4, 3, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (7, 1, 8)>
- <1, (8, 1, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (3, 1, 7)>
- <4, (6, 1, 9)>
- <6, (4, 1, 3)>
- <6, (4, 1, 9)>
- <6, (9, 4, 1)>
- <6, (9, 4, 1)>
- <6, (9, 4, 1)>
- <6, (9, 4, 1)>
