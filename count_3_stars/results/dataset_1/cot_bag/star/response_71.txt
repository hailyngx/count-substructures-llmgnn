Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars formed are:
- Node 0: [<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>]
- Node 2: [<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars from nodes with three or more neighbors:
Only the nodes 0 and 2 have three or more neighbors. So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
