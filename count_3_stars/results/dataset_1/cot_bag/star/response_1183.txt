Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 5: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 8: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 9: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0] = [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
