Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5), (8, 4), (9, 3)}

Let's examine each node to see which ones can form 3-stars:

Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 6), (3, 0), (6, 0) -> Node 0 can form 2 3-stars
Node 1: (1, 4), (4, 1) -> Node 1 can form 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 5), (5, 2) -> Node 2 can form 1 3-star
Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 9), (9, 3) -> Node 3 can form 1 3-star
Node 4: (1, 4), (4, 1), (4, 8), (8, 4) -> Node 4 can form 2 3-stars
Node 5: (2, 5), (5, 2), (5, 6), (6, 5) -> Node 5 can form 2 3-stars
Node 6: (0, 6), (5, 6), (6, 0), (6, 5) -> Node 6 can form 2 3-stars
Node 8: (4, 8), (8, 4) -> Node 8 can form 1 3-star
Node 9: (3, 9), (9, 3) -> Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1] = [13]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>
<4, (8, 1, 4)>
<5, (2, 6, 5)>
