Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

Node 1:
We have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Node 2:
We have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 4:
We have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 6:
We have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 7:
We have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars.

Node 9:
We have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [34] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>  
<1, (3, 6, 7)>  
<1, (4, 5, 6)>  
<1, (4, 7, 9)>  
<1, (5, 6, 7)>  
<1, (5, 7, 9)>  
<1, (6, 7, 9)>  
<2, (1, 6, 9)>  
<2, (1, 7, 9)>  
<2, (6, 7, 9)>  
<4, (5, 6, 9)>  
<4, (6, 7, 9)>  
<6, (5, 7, 9)>  
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
