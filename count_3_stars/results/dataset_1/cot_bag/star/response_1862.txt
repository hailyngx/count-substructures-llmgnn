Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 9). So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<0, (1, 5, 9)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 9). So, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 0, 5)>
<1, (5, 0, 9)>

Node 3 has 2 neighbors (1, 2). It cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+4] = 5.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)> and <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 0, 5)>, <1, (5, 0, 9)>.
