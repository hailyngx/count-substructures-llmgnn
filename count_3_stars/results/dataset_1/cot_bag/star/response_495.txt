Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 9, 1)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 4 + 4 = 18. 

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
