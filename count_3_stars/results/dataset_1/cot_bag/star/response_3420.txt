Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 6, 7, 9)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10. So, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
