Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 32 3-stars, which we will denote as [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
