Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes: 3, 5, 7; 3, 8, 9 (2 3-stars)
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes: 0, 1, 7 (1 3-star)
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes: 0, 1, 3; 0, 4, 5; 0, 6, 9; 1, 3, 4; 1, 5, 6 (5 3-stars)
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes: 0, 5, 6 (1 3-star)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2 + 1 + 5 + 1] = 9.
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 5, 6)>.
