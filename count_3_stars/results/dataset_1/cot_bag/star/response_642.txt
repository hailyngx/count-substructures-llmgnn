Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now let's analyze each node to see if it forms any 3-stars:

Node 0: Only has 1 neighbor.
Node 1: Forms one 3-star: <1, (4, 8, 5)>.
Node 2: Forms one 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 7)>.
Node 3: Only has 1 neighbor.
Node 4: Forms three 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 5)>.
Node 5: Forms one 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 8)>.
Node 6: Forms one 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 9)>.
Node 7: Forms three 3-stars: <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
Node 8: Forms one 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
Node 9: Only has 2 neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 [1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1].

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
