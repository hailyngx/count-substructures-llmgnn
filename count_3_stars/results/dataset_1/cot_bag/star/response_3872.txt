Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {2, 3, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
