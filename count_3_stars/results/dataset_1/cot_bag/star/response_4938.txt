Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

For the calculation of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 61

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [61]. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
