Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors in the given graph: node 0, node 2, node 4, node 5, and node 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 9). Hence, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 0.
2. Node 2: It has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7). Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.
3. Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 8, 9). Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
4. Node 5: It has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 6, 7). Hence, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.
5. Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 8). Hence, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [20] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
