Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- 0: {1, 4, 9}
- 1: {0, 2}
- 2: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- 3: {2, 7}
- 4: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- 5: {7, 8, 9}
- 6: {9}
- 7: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- 8: {2, 5}
- 9: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms [inom{3}{3} = 1] 3-star.
- Node 2 forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms [inom{3}{3} = 1] 3-star.
- Node 7 forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 24].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <2, 1, 3>
- <2, 1, 4>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 8, 5>
- <4, 0, 2>
- <4, 0, 7>
- <4, 2, 7>
- <4, 7, 5>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <7, 3, 9>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <9, 0, 4>
- <9, 5, 6>
- <9, 5, 7>
- <9, 5, 7>
- <9, 5, 7>
- <9, 5, 7>
- <9, 7, 4>
- <9, 7, 5>
