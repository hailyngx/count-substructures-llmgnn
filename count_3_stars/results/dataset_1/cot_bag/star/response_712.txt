Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given nodes and edges. 

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8)
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 3), forming 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 3)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 2), forming 1 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 7 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 9, 6), forming 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 6)>.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

After evaluating all nodes, we find that the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <2, (3, 4, 3)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
