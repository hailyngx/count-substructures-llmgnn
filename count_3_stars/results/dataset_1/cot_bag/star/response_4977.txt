Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2:  3-stars = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 6:  3-stars = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 7:  3-stars = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 8:  3-stars = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 9:  3-stars = $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$, which can be represented as [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, 7, 8>
- <6, 3, 9>
- <7, 1, 2>
- <8, 2, 9>
