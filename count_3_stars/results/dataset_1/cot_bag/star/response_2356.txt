Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given in the form (node1, node2).

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:  
Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 1: inom{7}{3} = 35
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars: [35 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20] = 73

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 73, and the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
