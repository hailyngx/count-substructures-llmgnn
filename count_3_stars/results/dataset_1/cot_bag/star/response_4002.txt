Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
