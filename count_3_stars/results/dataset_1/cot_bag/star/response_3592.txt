Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Applying the combinatorial calculation to each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, giving \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, giving \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, giving \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Calculating the total, we have a total of \(4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11\) 3-stars in this graph, represented inside brackets as [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (8, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
