Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we will go through each node and count the number of 3-stars it participates in. Remember, a 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: nodes 3, 5, and 7. 
So, there is 1 unique 3-star formed at node 0, which is <0, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6. 
So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars formed at node 1:
  1. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
  2. <1, (2, 3, 6)>
  3. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
  4. <1, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9. 
So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars formed at node 2:
  1. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
  2. <2, (1, 7, 9)>
  3. <2, (1, 8, 9)>
  4. <2, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8. 
So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars formed at node 3:
  1. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
  2. <3, (0, 1, 8)>
  3. <3, (0, 4, 8)>
  4. <3, (1, 4, 8)>

For the other nodes (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9):
- None of these nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so they do not participate in forming any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) = 13.

Putting this final count inside brackets, the answer is [13].
