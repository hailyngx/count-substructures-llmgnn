Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are represented as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the edges are given as:
(0, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8).

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

For node 0: 0 3-stars (has only 1 neighbor)
For node 1: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
For node 2: 6 3-stars (has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star + 3 other nodes = 4 total)
For node 3: 12 3-stars (has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
For node 4: 3 3-stars (has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star + 2 other nodes = 3 total)
For node 5: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
For node 6: 6 3-stars (has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars)
For node 7: 0 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
For node 8: 6 3-stars (has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star + 3 other nodes = 4 total)
For node 9: 3 3-stars (has 3 neighbors, so \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star + 2 other nodes = 3 total)

Adding these up: 
0 + 0 + 4 + 12 + 3 + 0 + 6 + 0 + 4 + 3 = 32

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>
