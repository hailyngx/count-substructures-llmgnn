Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (1, 8), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 1), (8, 9), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7  
Number of 3-stars centered at node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
<2, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6  
Number of 3-stars centered at node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (5, 6, 7)> and <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
