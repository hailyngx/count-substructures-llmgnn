Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 

Node 9 has 8 neighbors, while Nodes 2, 5, and 1 have 3 neighbors each. 

For Node 9, we can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
For Node 2, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 5, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 1, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
So in total, we have \( [56 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [59] \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)> 

This completes the analysis for the given graph.
