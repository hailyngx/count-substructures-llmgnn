Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 1, 2, 6, 8
- 1 is connected to 0, 6
- 2 is connected to 0, 3, 9
- 3 is connected to 2, 9
- 4 is connected to 7
- 5 is connected to 9
- 6 is connected to 0, 1
- 7 is connected to 4, 9
- 8 is connected to 0
- 9 is connected to 2, 3, 5, 7

To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
