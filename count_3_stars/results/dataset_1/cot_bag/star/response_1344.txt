Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars around them:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7) => [1]
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 9) => [1]
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 9) => [1]
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7, 8) => [1]
- Node 6: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9) => [1]
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6) => [1]

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 7, 9)>
6. <9, (1, 3, 5)>
