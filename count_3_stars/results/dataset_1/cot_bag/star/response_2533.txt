Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we can identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are C(4,3) = 4 3-stars formed with this node.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 7, 1)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>.
