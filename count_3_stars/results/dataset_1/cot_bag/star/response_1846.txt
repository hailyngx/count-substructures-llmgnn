Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Node 2, 4, and 6 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

Total number of 3-stars: [ 4 + 4 + 4 ]

Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
