Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For these nodes, the number of 3-stars formed would be:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 
\[ [10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [23] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 9, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
