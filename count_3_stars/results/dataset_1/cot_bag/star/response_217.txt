Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, let's first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 17 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
