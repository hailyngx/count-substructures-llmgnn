Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. Nodes 0, 1, and 8 have exactly three neighbors, so we can already identify three 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for the remaining nodes:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) additional 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) additional 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 3 (from nodes 0, 1, 8) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 7) = 13 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3 + 13 = 16].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, and <4, (0, 1, 6)>.
