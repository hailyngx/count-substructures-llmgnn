Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Based on the given edge information, the graph looks like this:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

No node has less than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 50\)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 0)>, <9, (4, 6, 1)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>.
