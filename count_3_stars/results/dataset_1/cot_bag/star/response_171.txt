Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is $1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11$ [11]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 8>
<4, 3, 7>
<4, 6, 5>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 1, 6>
<7, 1, 3>
<7, 1, 9>
<7, 3, 4>
<7, 4, 9>
<9, 0, 5>
