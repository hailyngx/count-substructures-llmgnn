Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For nodes 5 and 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [6 + (2\times 4)] = [6 + 8] = [14] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 3)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
