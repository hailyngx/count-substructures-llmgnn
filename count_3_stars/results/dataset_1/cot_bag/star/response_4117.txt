Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information.  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has three neighbors (3, 4, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has four neighbors (0, 1, 7, 8), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has three neighbors (3, 8, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.

Total 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 7) = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (8, 9, 3)>
