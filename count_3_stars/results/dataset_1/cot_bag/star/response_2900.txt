Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<6, 7, 1>
<7, 6, 1>
<8, 2, 3>
<9, 3, 1>
