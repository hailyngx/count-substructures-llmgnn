Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

From node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
From node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
From node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
From node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

So, the final answer is [7].
