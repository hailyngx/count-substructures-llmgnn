Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 9)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 6)

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 1, 5)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <5, (0, 4, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (0, 8, 2)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (1, 2, 4)>
  - <9, (1, 2, 5)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <9, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Counting up all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 21. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
