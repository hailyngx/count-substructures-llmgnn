Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: [1] 3-star
- Node 2: [1] 3-star
- Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = [0] 3-stars
- Node 5: [1] 3-star
- Node 8: [1] 3-star
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1] = [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
