Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0: It has 2 neighbors. Not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 1: It has 5 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 7, 8). \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars are possible. 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)> 

Node 2: It has 2 neighbors. Not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 3: It has 1 neighbor. Not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8). Only 1 3-star is possible.
<4, (0, 2, 8)>

Node 5: It has 1 neighbor. Not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 6: It has 2 neighbors. Not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 7: It has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 6). Only 1 3-star is possible.
<7, (1, 3, 6)>

Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9). Only 1 3-star is possible.
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 9: It has 1 neighbor. Not enough to form a 3-star.

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \(10 + 1 + 1 = 12\). Hence, the answer is [12].
