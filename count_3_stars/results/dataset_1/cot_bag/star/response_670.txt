Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be represented visually as follows:

```
    1 -- 2
    |    |
    8 -- 0 -- 9
          |
          4 -- 6 -- 5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 0, 5)>.
