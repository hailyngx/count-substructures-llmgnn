Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll consider each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
