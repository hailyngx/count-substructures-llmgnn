Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2, 4
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 4
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>.
