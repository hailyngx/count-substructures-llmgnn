Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the adjacency list for the graph is as follows:

0: [5, 7]
1: [2, 7, 8, 9]
2: [1, 7, 8]
3: [5]
4: [7]
5: [0, 3, 8]
6: [8]
7: [0, 1, 2, 4, 8]
8: [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
9: [1]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 26 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the final result is [26], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 4, 8)>, <1, (7, 5, 0)>, <1, (7, 5, 3)>, <2, (1, 7, 0)>, <2, (1, 7, 4)>, <5, (0, 7, 4)>, <7, (1, 8, 2)>, <7, (1, 8, 5)>, <7, (2, 8, 5)>, <7, (4, 8, 1)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>
