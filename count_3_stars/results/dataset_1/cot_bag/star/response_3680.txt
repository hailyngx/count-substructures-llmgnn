Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [43].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>
