Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 3)>
<0, (2, 8, 4)>
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
