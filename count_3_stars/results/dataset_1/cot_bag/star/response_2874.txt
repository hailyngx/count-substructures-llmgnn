Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, for each such node, we calculate the number of 3-stars it forms.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9)
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (7, 9)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9)
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, and <9, (0, 1, 2)>.

Is there anything else you would like to know about this graph or any other questions you have?
