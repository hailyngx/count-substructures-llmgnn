Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 8, and 9. Let's find the 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Node 1 forms <1, (0, 9, 3)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, and <1, (3, 7, 8)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 forms <8, (1, 7, 3)> and <8, (1, 6, 7)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 forms <9, (0, 2, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 2 + 1] = 6, and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 9, 3)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 3)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, and <9, (0, 2, 1)>.
