Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it forms.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star. (2, 3, 7)
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star. (3, 7, 4)
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star. (4, 7, 2)
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star. (7, 4, 6)
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star. (8, 3, 6)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, 3, 7>, <3, 7, 4>, <4, 7, 2>, <7, 4, 6>, <8, 3, 6>.
