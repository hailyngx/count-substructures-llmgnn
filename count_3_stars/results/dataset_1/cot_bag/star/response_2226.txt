Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: [4]
- For Node 1: [4]
- For Node 7: [4]
- For Node 9: [6]

Therefore, there are [4+4+4+6] = [18] 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (7, 8, 0)>
