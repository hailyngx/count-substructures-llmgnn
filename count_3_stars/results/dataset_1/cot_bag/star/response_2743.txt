Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges based on the provided edge list:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 7), 
       (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8),
       (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6),
       (8, 4), (8, 5)

Now let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star and list the unique 3-stars:

Node 0:
- We have 4 edges connected to node 0: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)
- Therefore, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 0.
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 1:
- We have 4 edges connected to node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7)
- Therefore, there are no additional 3-stars with node 1.

Node 2:
- We have 2 edges connected to node 2, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 2.

Node 3:
- We have 4 edges connected to node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7)
- Therefore, there are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 3.
- Unique 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>

Node 4:
- We have 3 edges connected to node 4: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8)
- Therefore, there are no additional 3-stars with node 4.

Node 5:
- We have 3 edges connected to node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8)
- Therefore, there are no additional 3-stars with node 5.

Node 6:
- We have 5 edges connected to node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7)
- Therefore, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 6.
- Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, 
               <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, 
               <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>

Node 7:
- We have 5 edges connected to node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6)
- Therefore, there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 7.
- Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, 
               <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, 
               <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>

Node 8:
- We have 2 edges connected to node 8, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 28.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>
