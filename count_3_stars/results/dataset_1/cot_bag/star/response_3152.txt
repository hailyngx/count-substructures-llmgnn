Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, as these nodes can potentially form 3-stars. Then we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
