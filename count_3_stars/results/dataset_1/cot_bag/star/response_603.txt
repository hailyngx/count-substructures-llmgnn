Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 4, 6, and 9. 

For node 4:
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 4: nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9. Hence, the number of 3-stars around node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
The unique 3-stars around node 4 are: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>.

For node 6:
There are 5 neighbors connected to node 6: nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Hence, the number of 3-stars around node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). 
The unique 3-stars around node 6 are: <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.

For node 9:
There are 4 neighbors connected to node 9: nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8. Hence, the number of 3-stars around node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
The unique 3-stars around node 9 are: <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10 + 4 = 18]. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
