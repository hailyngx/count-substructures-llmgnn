Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0, there are 2 choose 3 = 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 1, there are 1 choose 3 = 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 2, there are 1 choose 3 = 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 3, there are 2 choose 3 = 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 4, there are 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 5, there are 2 choose 3 = 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 6, there are 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 7, there are 0 possible 3-star configurations.
For node 8, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 possible 3-star configurations.

Therefore, there is a total of [1] 3-star in this graph. It can be represented as <8, (0, 3, 7)>.
