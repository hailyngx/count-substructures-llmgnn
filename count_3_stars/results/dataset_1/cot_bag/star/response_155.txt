Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-star graphs in this given graph.

Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 2: Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 8, 9), so it can form 10 3-stars. 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 4: Node 4 has 2 neighbors (2, 9), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star. 
<5, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 6: Node 6 has 2 neighbors (5, 7), so it can form 0 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] in the given graph is 12.
