Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <0, (2, 3, 5)> 
    - <0, (2, 5, 6)> 
    - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 5, 6)>

- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 7, 8)> 
    - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (7, 9, 3)>
    - <2, (7, 9, 4)>
    - <2, (7, 9, 5)>
    - <2, (8, 9, 3)>
    - <2, (8, 9, 4)>
    - <2, (8, 9, 5)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
    - <4, (6, 7, 9)>

- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
    - <5, (0, 2, 9)>

- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <9, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <9, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [30] \)
