Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Edges: (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 2), (5, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, and <7, (2, 3, 8)>.
