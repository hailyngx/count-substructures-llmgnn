Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 1: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, and 8), so it can form 1 3-star. <1, (3, 4, 8)>

For Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8), so it can form 4 3-stars. <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>

For Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5), so it can form 1 3-star. <4, (1, 3, 5)>

For Node 7: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 6), so it can form 1 3-star. <7, (2, 3, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>
