Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars, we'll first note the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [12] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (8, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)> 
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
