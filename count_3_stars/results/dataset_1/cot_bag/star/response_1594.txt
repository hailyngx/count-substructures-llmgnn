Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of [10 choose 3] = 120 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
