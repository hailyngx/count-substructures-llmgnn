Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 60 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <7, (6, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>
