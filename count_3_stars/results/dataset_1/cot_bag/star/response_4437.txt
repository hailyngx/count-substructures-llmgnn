Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 1}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 11 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 6)>, <7, (8, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
