Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7).
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 8, 9).
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (6, 3).

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 12 3-stars. So, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 3, 4)>
