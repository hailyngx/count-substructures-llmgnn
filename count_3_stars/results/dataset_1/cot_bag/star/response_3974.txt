Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Based on the edges provided, the neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 3, 6>
<6, 0, 5>
<6, 3, 5>
<7, 0, 8>
<8, 1, 4>
