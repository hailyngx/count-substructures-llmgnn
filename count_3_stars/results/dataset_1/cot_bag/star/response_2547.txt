Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.
The list of edges given represents the connections between the nodes.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 (isolated node) doesn't participate in any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
