Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 2 neighbors  
Node 1 has 1 neighbor  
Node 2 has 1 neighbor  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors  
Node 4 has 2 neighbors  
Node 5 has 6 neighbors  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors  
Node 7 has 2 neighbors   
Node 8 has 2 neighbors  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 3 with 3 neighbors can form 1 3-star.  
Node 5 with 6 neighbors can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.   
Node 6 with 4 neighbors can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  
Node 9 with 4 neighbors can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Adding all the 3-stars gives us a total of 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 29 3-stars.  
Therefore, the final answer is [29].
