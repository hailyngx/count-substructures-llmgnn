Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 has neighbors 1 and 5.
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 has neighbors 1 and 3.
- Node 7 has neighbors 0 and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 0 = 5

The final number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>
