Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's visualize the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to 1, 3, 4
- Node 1 is connected to 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 is connected to 8
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 4, 6
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 3, 9
- Node 6 is connected to 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7 is connected to 1, 6
- Node 8 is connected to 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9 is connected to 4, 8

From the given information, we can see that nodes 1, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 1: 
- Number of 3-stars around node 1 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (0, 7, 8)>

For node 6: 
- Number of 3-stars around node 6 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 8: 
- Number of 3-stars around node 8 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph [] = 9.
