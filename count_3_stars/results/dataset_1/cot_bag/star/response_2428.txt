Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 2 neighbors,   
Node 1 has 2 neighbors,   
Node 2 has 1 neighbor,   
Node 3 has 4 neighbors,   
Node 4 has 2 neighbors,   
Node 5 has 4 neighbors,   
Node 6 has 1 neighbor,   
Node 7 has 2 neighbors,   
Node 8 has 3 neighbors,   
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.   

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each eligible node:  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
Total = 4 + 4 + 1  = 9  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<3, (5, 7, 8)>  
<3, (5, 7, 9)>  
<3, (5, 8, 9)>  
<5, (3, 7, 8)>  
<5, (3, 7, 9)>  
<5, (3, 8, 9)>  
<8, (3, 5, 7)>  
<8, (3, 5, 9)>  
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
