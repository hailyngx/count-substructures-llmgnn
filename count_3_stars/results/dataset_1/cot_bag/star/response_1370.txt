Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be described as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7.

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star = 1
- Node 1: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star
- Node 2: 1 neighbor, so no 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star = 1
- Node 4: 1 neighbor, so no 3-star
- Node 5: 1 neighbor, so no 3-star
- Node 7: 1 neighbor, so no 3-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars = 4
- Node 9: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
