Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges, we will first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edge list, we can determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 7)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

Next, we will list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
