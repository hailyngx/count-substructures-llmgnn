Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can determine the number of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the 3-stars for all relevant nodes:
10 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 2)>, <0, (1, 7, 3)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (3, 0, 8)>, <7, (3, 1, 8)>, <7, (3, 1, 0)>, <7, (3, 1, 9)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>, <7, (8, 0, 3)>, <7, (8, 1, 3)>, <7, (8, 1, 0)>.
