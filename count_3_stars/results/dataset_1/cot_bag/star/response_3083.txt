Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
    - Total 3-stars with node 0 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {7, 9}
    - Total 3-stars with node 1 = 0

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 7, 8, 9}
    - Total 3-stars with node 4 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars with node 4: <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: {0, 2}
    - Total 3-stars with node 5 = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10 + 0 + 10 + 0] = 20.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>.
