Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are several nodes with only one or two neighbors, so we can focus on nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Looking at node 0: 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9)
- Applying the formula \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 4, 9)>

Looking at node 2: 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 5), (2, 7), (5, 2)
- Applying the formula \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), there is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (5, 7, 2)>

Looking at node 4: 
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: (0, 4), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
- Applying the formula \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \), there are 20 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
<4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>,
<4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (8, 9, 0)>,
<4, (7, 5, 0)>, <4, (8, 5, 0)>, <4, (9, 5, 0)>, <4, (8, 7, 0)>

Looking at node 7: 
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (2, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (7, 4), (7, 8)
- Applying the formula \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), there are 10 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
<7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 2)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 0)>, <7, (4, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <7, (8, 2, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 20 + 10] = 32.
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 2)>, <7, (4, 5, 0)>, <7, (4, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <7, (8, 2, 0)>
