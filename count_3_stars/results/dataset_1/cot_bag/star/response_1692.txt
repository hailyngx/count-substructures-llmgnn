Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
       0 ---- 3 ---- 6
      /|     /|   /|
     8 |    1 |  9 |
     / |    | | /  |
    2  |    | |/   |
    \  |    |/    /
     5 ---- 5 -- 7
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars.

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

Node 0: 2 neighbors -> no 3-star
Node 1: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 2: 2 neighbors -> no 3-star
Node 3: 6 neighbors -> 6 3-stars
Node 5: 5 neighbors -> 10 3-stars
Node 6: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 9: 4 neighbors -> 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 6 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
