Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to determine if it forms a 3-star, and if so, list the unique 3-stars.

Node 0: has 2 neighbors (4), so no 3-star formed.

Node 1: has 2 neighbors (6, 8), so no 3-star formed.

Node 2: has 1 neighbor (5), so no 3-star formed.

Node 3: has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 9), so there are 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (4, 8, 9)>.

Node 4: has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 9), so there are 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 3, 6)>.

Node 5: has 2 neighbors (2, 6), so no 3-star formed.

Node 6: has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5), so there are 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 4, 5)>.

Node 7: has 1 neighbor (8), so no 3-star formed.

Node 8: has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7), so there are 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 3, 7)>.

Node 9: has 3 neighbors (3, 4), so there are 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (3, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>.
