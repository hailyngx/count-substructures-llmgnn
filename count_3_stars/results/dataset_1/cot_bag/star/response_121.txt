Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are only 2 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 1 and node 4.

For node 1, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

For node 4, we have inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars since it only has 2 neighbors.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
