Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors in the given graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 6

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
