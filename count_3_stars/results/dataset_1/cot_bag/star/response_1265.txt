Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the given edges correspond to the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Let's analyze the nodes to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 7).
  3-stars with node 1 as the center: [1].
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (1, 5, 7, 9).
  3-stars with node 3 as the center: [1].
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1, 3, 9).
  3-stars with node 5 as the center: [1].
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (0, 2, 9).
  3-stars with node 6 as the center: [1].
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 3, 4).
  3-stars with node 7 as the center: [1].
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (3, 4, 5, 6).
  3-stars with node 9 as the center: [1].

The total number of 3-stars is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>.
