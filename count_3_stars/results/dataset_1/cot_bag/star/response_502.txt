Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32 \), so the final answer is [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
