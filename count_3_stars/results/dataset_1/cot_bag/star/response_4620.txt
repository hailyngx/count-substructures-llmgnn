Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Looking at the list of edges, we can determine that nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have at least three neighbors each. 

- For node 0, we have 2 3-stars: <0, (5, 7)> and <0, (7, 5)>.
- For node 2, we have 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>.
- For node 3, we have 2 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 9)> and <3, (5, 9, 2)>.
- For node 4, we have 1 3-star: <4, (7, 9, 0)>.
- For node 5, we have 1 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 6)>.
- For node 7, we have 2 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 9)> and <7, (4, 9, 0)>.
- For node 9, we have 1 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 10 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
