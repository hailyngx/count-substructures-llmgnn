Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors each node has:
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 1 neighbor

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: Does not qualify (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Does not qualify (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: Does not qualify (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is the sum of the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors, which is 10 + 0 + 0 = 10.

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
