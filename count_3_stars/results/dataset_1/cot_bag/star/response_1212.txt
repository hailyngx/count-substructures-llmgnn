Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can find the total number of 3-stars by following the steps outlined earlier. 

Let's first identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 1

Considering the neighbors of each node, we have:
- Node 0 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 4 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)> and <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 0 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1] = [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
