Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 8

Nodes 0, 5, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier.

For Node 0:
- \({4\choose 3}\) = 4

For Node 5:
- \({4\choose 3}\) = 4

For Node 8:
- \({4\choose 3}\) = 4

Summing these up: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 0, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 9, 5)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
