Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first note the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 1: 0, 4
Node 2: 3, 6, 7
Node 3: 2, 6
Node 4: 0, 1
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3
Node 7: 2, 5
Node 8: 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
