Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars

Adding up the possible 3-stars from each node, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 66 \) 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
