Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7


Next, we will determine the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, 9: <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 9: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, 9: <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, 9: <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph: [4].

So, the final answer is [4].
