Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the provided information, we can map out the graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 9), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1: Degree 3 (neighbors: 4, 5, 6)
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 6)>

Node 2: Degree 2 (neighbors: 0, 9)

Node 3: Degree 2 (neighbors: 7, 9)

Node 4: Degree 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 5)
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>

Node 5: Degree 5 (neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 6: Degree 2 (neighbors: 1, 9)

Node 7: Degree 3 (neighbors: 3, 5, 8)
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <7, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 8: Degree 2 (neighbors: 5, 7)

Node 9: Degree 4 (neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6)
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Putting it all together:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 17
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
