Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
