Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors 2, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors 7, 8, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 3, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 3, 5, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors 2, 4, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 4, 5, 9 (4 neighbors)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [18]

Unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
