Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have at least three neighbors. Looking at the list of edges, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, and 6. So, it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, and 8. So, it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 5. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 9) = 12.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>.
