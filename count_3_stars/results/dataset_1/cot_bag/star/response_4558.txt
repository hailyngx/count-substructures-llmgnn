Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars are formed around it.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 7
- Node 0 forms [1] 3-star.

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 forms [1] 3-star.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8 forms [1] 3-star.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 forms [1] 3-star.

Summing up the 3-stars from each eligible node, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
