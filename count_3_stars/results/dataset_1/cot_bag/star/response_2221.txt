Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node. Let's begin:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (3, 4, 5, 7, 9). 
  There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 1.
  <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>,
  <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (4, 5, 7).
  There is 1 3-star centered at node 2.
  <2, (4, 5, 7)>

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (1, 6, 9).
  There is 1 3-star centered at node 3.
  <3, (1, 6, 9)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 7, 8).
  There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 4.
  <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 7, 7).
  There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 5.
  <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars formed by the graph is [10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 20.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 7)>
