Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors, form 1 3-star)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars found in the graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
