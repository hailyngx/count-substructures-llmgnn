Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

We will focus on the nodes with three or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars they participate in. 

For node 1: 
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4. So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 
<1,(0, 8, 9)>, <1,(0, 8, 9)>, <1,(8, 9, 1)>, <1,(0, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 6. So, there are 20 unique 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
<7,(0, 3, 5)>, <7,(0, 5, 9)>, <7,(1, 2, 7)>, <7,(1, 8, 9)>, <7,(0, 2, 5)>, <7,(1, 8, 9)>, <7,(0, 3, 9)>, <7,(0, 5, 9)>, <7,(1, 2, 7)>, <7,(1, 8, 9)>, <7,(0, 2, 5)>, <7,(1, 8, 9)>, <7,(0, 3, 5)>, <7,(0, 5, 9)>, <7,(0, 3, 9)>, <7,(0, 5, 9)>, <7,(1, 2, 7)>, <7,(1, 8, 9)>, <7,(0, 2, 5)>, <7,(1, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors out of 3. So, there is 1 unique 3-star with node 8 as the center:
<8,(1, 4, 5)>

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [4 + 20 + 1] = 25 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 25.
