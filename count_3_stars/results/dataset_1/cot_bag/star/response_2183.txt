Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Analyzing each node, the number of 3-stars for each node is as follows:
- Node 0: [] = 0
- Node 1: [] = 0
- Node 2: [] = 0
- Node 3: [] = 0
- Node 4: [1] = 1 <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: [1] = 1 <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 6: [] = 0
- Node 7: [1] = 1 <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: [1] = 1 <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 9: [3] = 3 <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 3] = 7.
