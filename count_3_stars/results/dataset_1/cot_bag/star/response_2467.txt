Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9. Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 1)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>.
