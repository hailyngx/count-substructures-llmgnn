Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 4] = [24] \). 

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 4)>
- <1, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 3, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 0)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 0, 5)>
- <4, (1, 0, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 1, 8)>
- <4, (5, 0, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (4, 1, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 0)>
- <3, (4, 8, 1)>
