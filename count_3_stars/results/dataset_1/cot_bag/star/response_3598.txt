Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node with three or more neighbors. Then we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node.

Let's start by listing the nodes with three or more neighbors along with their neighbors:

- Node 1: (6, 7)
- Node 2: (3, 4)
- Node 3: (2, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (2, 3)
- Node 5: (7, 9)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 9: (3, 5, 7)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Multiplying the number of 3-stars for each node by the number of nodes, we get:

\( (4 + 4) = 8 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8, which we represent as [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 1, 5)>
- <7, (3, 1, 9)>
