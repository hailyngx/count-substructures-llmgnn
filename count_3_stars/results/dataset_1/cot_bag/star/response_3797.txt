Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9. Let's go through each of these central nodes:

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 8)>

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 9)>

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars: 0

For Node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 9)>

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>

For Node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [12]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
