Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 8       2 -- 0 -- 3
    |     |       |         |
    9 --  ] -- 6  -- ] -- 4
             |         |
             ]         ]
             |         |
             5 -- 7    7 -- 0
```

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7 --> \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 8, 9 --> No 3-stars
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 0 --> No 3-stars
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4 --> No 3-stars
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 3 --> No 3-stars
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7 --> No 3-stars
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5 --> No 3-stars
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5 --> No 3-stars
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9 --> No 3-stars
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 8 --> No 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4. 

Therefore, the answer is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>.
