Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the total number of 3-stars formed. 

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 9.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's focus on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. 
Node 4 has 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 5, and 9.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, and 8.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
For node 4: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 56 + 4 = 70 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
