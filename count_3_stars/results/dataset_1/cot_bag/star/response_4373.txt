Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors in this graph are: 
- Node 0 with 4 neighbors
- Node 2 with 5 neighbors
- Node 3 with 3 neighbors
- Node 4 with 3 neighbors
- Node 8 with 5 neighbors
- Node 9 with 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: Since it has only 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star
For node 4: Since it has only 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\( 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
