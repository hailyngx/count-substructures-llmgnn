Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look at each node and check how many neighbors it has. 

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 20 + 10 + 20 = 50 \). So, we can write the answer as: 

\[ [50] \]

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
