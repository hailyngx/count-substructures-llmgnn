Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Let's determine the number of 3-stars present in the graph:
- For Node 0: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]]
- For Node 1: [\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]] (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 2: [\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]]
- For Node 3: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]] (4 unique 3-stars)
- For Node 4: [\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]] (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 5: [\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]] (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 6: [\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]] (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 7: [\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]] (4 unique 3-stars)
- For Node 8: [\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]] (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 9: [\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]] (20 unique 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ [1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 20] = [30] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
