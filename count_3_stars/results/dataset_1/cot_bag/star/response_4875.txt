Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they could potentially form 3-stars. Node 0, node 2, node 3, and node 8 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 
For node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
