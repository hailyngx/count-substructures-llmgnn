Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes connected to each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [0 choose 3] = 0 3-stars
- Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [2 choose 3] = 0 3-stars
- Node 3: [2 choose 3] = 0 3-stars
- Node 4: [2 choose 3] = 0 3-stars
- Node 5: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (8, 0, 9)>
<9, (8, 1, 9)>
<9, (8, 6, 9)>
