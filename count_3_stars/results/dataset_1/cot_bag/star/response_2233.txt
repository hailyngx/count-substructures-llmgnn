Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node with three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
