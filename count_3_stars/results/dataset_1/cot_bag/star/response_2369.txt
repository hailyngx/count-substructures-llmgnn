Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with at least 3 neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

There is a total of \(1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 23\) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is \([23]\) and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
