Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here's a list of those nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 2: {3, 4} (degree = 2)
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6} (degree = 3)
- Node 4: {2, 7} (degree = 2)
- Node 6: {3, 7} (degree = 2)
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6} (degree = 3)
- Node 8: {0, 9} (degree = 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree > 2:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 = 2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>, and <7, (1, 4, 6)>.
