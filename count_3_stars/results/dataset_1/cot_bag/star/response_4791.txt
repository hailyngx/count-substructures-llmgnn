Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
