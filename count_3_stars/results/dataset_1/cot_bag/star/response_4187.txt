Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
   1 --- 6
  /       \
 5 --- 0 --- 8 --- 7
  \       /
   3 --- 2
```

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 1, 6)>
- <0, (5, 3, 6)>
- <0, (8, 7, 4)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 3)>
- <5, (2, 0, 8)>
- <5, (2, 0, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 4)>
