Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 2, 5
Node 1: 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 3: 2, 7
Node 4: 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 6
Node 6: 2, 5
Node 7: 3, 4, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 4
Node 9: 1, 4, 7

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each such node:
Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars is [0+0+4+1+1+1+1] = [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 4, 9)>
<4, (7, 3, 9)>
<7, (7, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
