Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors, as mentioned earlier. Let's go through each node:

- Node 0: It has 1 neighbor (Node 5).
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (Nodes 3, 4, 5, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 1.
- Node 2: It has 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 7).
- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 6, 7). There is 1 3-star with Node 3.
- Node 4: It has 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 7).
- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 2). There is 1 3-star with Node 5.
- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 7, 9). There is 1 3-star with Node 6.
- Node 7: It has 6 neighbors (Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with Node 7.
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors (Nodes 6, 7).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 26.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>.
