Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

Now, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 1: It has 2 neighbors (4, 7), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 2: It has 2 neighbors (5, 8), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.  
<3, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
<4, (1, 5, 7)>

Node 5: It has 7 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9), so it forms 35 3-stars.

Node 6: It has 1 neighbor (3), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 7: It has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5), so it forms 10 3-stars.
<7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>

Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Node 9: It has 2 neighbors (3, 5), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 35 + 10 + 1] = [48] 

Unique 3-stars:
