Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 0), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 6)

Now let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node that has at least 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Node 0: has 5 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8, 9) --> Total 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 1: has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 7) --> Total 3-stars = inom{5}{3}= 10
Node 6: has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9) --> Total 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6) --> Total 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up all the 3-stars: 10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 9) = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 2)>
