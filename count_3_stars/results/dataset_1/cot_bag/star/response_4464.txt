Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Considering the given graph, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
