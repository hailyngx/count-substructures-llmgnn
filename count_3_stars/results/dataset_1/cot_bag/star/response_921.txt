Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, we have 4 3-stars each: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For nodes 4, 8, 9, we have 4 3-stars each: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 16 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [16]. And the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
