Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 5}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
