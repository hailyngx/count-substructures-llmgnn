Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8.
  
 Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node: 
  - Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
  - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 26 \)

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)> 
  
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
