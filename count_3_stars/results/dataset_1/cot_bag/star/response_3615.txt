Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars formed by each of them.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 7, 9}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 9}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 8}
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5}
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 4}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these gives us a total of 14 3-stars: [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1,(4, 7, 9)>
<1,(4, 6, 9)>
<1,(4, 6, 7)>
<1,(6, 7, 9)>
<3,(0, 7, 9)>
<3,(7, 4, 9)>
<3,(4, 9, 7)>
<3,(0, 4, 9)>
<4,(1, 3, 9)>
<5,(2, 6, 8)>
<9,(1, 3, 4)>
<9,(1, 4, 3)>
<9,(3, 4, 9)>
<9,(1, 3, 4)>
