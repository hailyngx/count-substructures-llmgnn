Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star based on the criteria explained earlier. Here is a breakdown:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 3: Forms 2 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 9)> and <3, (5, 9, 4)>.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms 3 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, and <5, (1, 3, 6)>.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms 2 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 8)> and <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = 12.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (7, 8, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
