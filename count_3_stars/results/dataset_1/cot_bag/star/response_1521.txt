Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

For node 0:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, and 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = inom{3}{3} = 1
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 2:
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, and 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center = inom{4}{3} = 4
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 3:
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center = inom{5}{3} = 10
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = inom{6}{3} = 20
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, and 8.
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = inom{4}{3} = 4
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4] = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 39.
