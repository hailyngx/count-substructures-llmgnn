Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 2:
    - Number of neighbors: 5
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>

2. Node 3:
    - Number of neighbors: 5
    - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 6)>, <3, (5, 8, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 6)>, <3, (5, 8, 6)>

3. Node 4:
    - Number of neighbors: 2
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

4. Node 5:
    - Number of neighbors: 3
    - Number of 3-stars: 1
    - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>

5. Node 8:
    - Number of neighbors: 3
    - Number of 3-stars: 1
    - Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 22].
