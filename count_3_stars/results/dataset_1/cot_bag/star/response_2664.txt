Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, node 4, and node 6.

For node 0:
- It has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Hence, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
The possible 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>

For node 1:
- It has 4 neighbors: nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Hence, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
The possible 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 4:
- It has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
- Hence, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
The possible 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
- It has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Hence, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
The possible 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of [16] 3-stars in the graph.
