Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.

Let's find the 3-star structures in this graph:

Node 0 and Node 3 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Node 4 and Node 9 each have 2 neighbors, so they can't form any 3-stars.
Node 2, Node 5, and Node 7 each have 2 neighbors, so they can't form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4] = 8 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 9, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 5)>
- <3, (8, 9, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
