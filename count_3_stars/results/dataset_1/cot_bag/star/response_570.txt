Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed as follows:    
- Node 0: 2, 5    
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8, 9    
- Node 3: 4, 8    
- Node 4: 3, 8    
- Node 5: 0    
- Node 7: 2, 8    
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7    
- Node 9: 2    

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:    
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)    
  This means there are 4 unique 3-stars involving Node 2.  
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)    
  This means there are 4 unique 3-stars involving Node 8.  

Adding these up gives a total of 8 unique 3-stars.  
Hence, the final answer is [8].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (0, 8, 9)>  
<2, (7, 8, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
