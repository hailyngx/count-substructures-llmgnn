Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2, 3

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

The total number of 3-stars is [1] and the unique 3-star found is <> (2, 5, 7).
