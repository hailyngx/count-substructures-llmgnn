Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with its nodes and edges.  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 4 and 8
- 1 is connected to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8
- 2 is connected to 1 and 5
- 3 is connected to 1, 6, and 8
- 4 is connected to 0, 1, and 8
- 5 is connected to 1 and 2
- 6 is connected to 3
- 8 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9
- 9 is connected to 8

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in.

- Node 1: 3-stars formed considering its neighbors (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 4, 5), and (3, 4, 5) [4]
- Node 8: 3-stars formed considering its neighbors (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 8), (0, 4, 8), and (1, 3, 4) [4]

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4] = [8]

List of unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>
