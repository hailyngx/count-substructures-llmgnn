Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 8, 0)>. 

So, the final answer is [6].
