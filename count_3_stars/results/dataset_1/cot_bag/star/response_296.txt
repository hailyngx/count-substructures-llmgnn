Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's construct the graph:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
Node 2 is connected to node 1.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0: There are 3 choose 3 ways to choose the neighbors, but as there are only 2 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 1: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose the neighbors. Thus, <1, (2, 6, 7)>.

For node 3: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose the neighbors. Thus, <3, (0, 5, 8)>.

For node 5: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose the neighbors. Thus, <5, (0, 3, 4)>.

For node 8: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose the neighbors. Thus, <8, (3, 6, 7)>.

Summing up, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4 3-stars in the graph.
