Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, and 8. So the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 5. So the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 6. So the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 8. So there are no 3-stars formed with node 6 as the center.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, and 8. So the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 1. So there are no 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>.
