Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 9)
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3)
(2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9)
(3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8)
(4, 0), (4, 8)
(5, 2), (5, 8)
(6, 2)
(7, 3), (7, 9)
(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors,
Node 3 has 3 neighbors,
Node 8 has 5 neighbors,
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 22

So, the final answer is [22].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
