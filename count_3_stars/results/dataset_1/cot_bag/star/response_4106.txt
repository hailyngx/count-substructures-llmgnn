Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- For Node 8: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- For Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 2, 4, 5>
- <1, 2, 3, 6>
- <2, 0, 1, 3>
- <4, 0, 2, 9>
- <5, 0, 3, 9>
- <9, 2, 4, 5>
- <9, 2, 5, 6>
- <9, 2, 4, 6>
- <9, 4, 5, 6>
- <9, 5, 6, 8>
