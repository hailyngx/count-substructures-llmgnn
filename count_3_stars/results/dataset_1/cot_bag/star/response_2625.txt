Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 1.

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 2.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 7. There is only 1 unique 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 2, 7)>.

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 6.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 9.

Summing these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 29 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, and <9, (1, 4, 6)>.
