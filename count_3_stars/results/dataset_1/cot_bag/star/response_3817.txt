Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 9). It forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 6)>.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: (0, 2, 5, 8, 9). It forms 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (2, 5, 7, 9). It forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 5, 9)>.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (2, 4, 6). It forms 1 3-star: <9, (2, 4, 6)>.

In total, there are 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
