Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 35 + 20 + 10 = 73 \).

Therefore, the final answer is: [73]
And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
