Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are given below:

Node 0: 1, 6, 7  
Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 9  
Node 2: 5, 8  
Node 3: 8  
Node 4: 1, 5, 6  
Node 5: 2, 4, 9  
Node 6: 0, 4, 7  
Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9  
Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9  
Node 9: 1, 5, 7, 8  

Now let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0  
Node 3: [inom{1}{3}] = 0  
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1  
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10  
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4  

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 26

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<1, (0, 4, 7)>  
<4, (1, 5, 6)>  
<5, (2, 4, 9)>  
<6, (0, 4, 7)>  
<7, (1, 8, 9)>  
<8, (2, 7, 9)>  
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [26].
