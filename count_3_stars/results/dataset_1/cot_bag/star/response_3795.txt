Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

- Node 0: has 4 edges, forming one 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: has 3 edges, forming one 3-star: <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: has 2 edges, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3: has 1 edge, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4: has 4 edges, forming one 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: has 1 edge, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6: has 3 edges, forming one 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 7: has 4 edges, forming one 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 8: has 3 edges, forming one 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 9: has 1 edge, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, and <7, (0, 1, 4)>.
