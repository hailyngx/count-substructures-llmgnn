Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors are:  
- Node 0 with neighbors 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4 with neighbors 0, 1, 3
- Node 7 with neighbors 2, 5, 6
- Node 8 with neighbors 0, 9
- Node 9 with neighbors 0, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1] = 6 \).

The 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (2, 4, 9)>  
<0, (4, 1, 3)>  
<0, (8, 9, 2)>  
<0, (9, 8, 2)>  
<4, (0, 3, 1)>    
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
