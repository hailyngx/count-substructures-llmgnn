Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, and 9.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, and 7.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 4.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 2.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 32

So, the final answer is [32], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
