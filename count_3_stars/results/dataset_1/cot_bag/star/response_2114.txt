Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

     0 --- 1 --- 4
     |     |     |
     8     5     9
      \   / \   /
        2 --- 6
         \   /
           3

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph following the method mentioned earlier. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9

For node 1: 1 3-star
For node 2: 1 3-star
For node 4: 1 3-star
For node 5: 1 3-star
For node 8: 1 3-star
For node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
