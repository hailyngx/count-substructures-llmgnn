Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 84 \]

So, there are 84 3-stars in this graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [84].
