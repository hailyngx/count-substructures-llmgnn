Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.

Now, let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form one 3-star. 
    Total 3-stars involving Node 0: 1

Node 3: Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
    Total 3-stars involving Node 3: 20

Node 7: Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form one 3-star.
    Total 3-stars involving Node 7: 1

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, and considering the 3-stars involving the nodes with 3 neighbors, we have a total of [1 + 20 + 1] = 22 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>.
