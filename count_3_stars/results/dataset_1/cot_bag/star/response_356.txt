Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- 1: {2, 4, 7}
- 2: {1, 8, 9}
- 3: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- 4: {1, 8}
- 5: {0, 3, 9}
- 6: {0, 8, 9}
- 7: {1, 3}
- 8: {2, 4, 6}
- 9: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes: <2, (1, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = [4 + 1] = [5]
