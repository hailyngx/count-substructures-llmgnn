Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 1, 3  
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9  
Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 9  
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5  
Node 4: 1, 2, 3  
Node 5: 1, 3, 6  
Node 6: 2, 5, 8  
Node 7: 9  
Node 8: 6  
Node 9: 1, 2, 7  

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:  

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <1, (4, 5, 9)>  
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <2, (4, 6, 9)>  

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
There are 2 unique 3-stars.
