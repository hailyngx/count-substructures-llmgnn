Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since this graph has 10 nodes, we will analyze each node to see if it can form a 3-star. From the given edges, we find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (1, 5, 6)
- Node 1: (0, 6, 7)
- Node 2: (6, 7, 9)
- Node 3: (6, 7)
- Node 4: (6, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 7, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Node 7: (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (4, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (2, 4, 5, 7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 9:  inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

So, there are a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10] = 45 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
