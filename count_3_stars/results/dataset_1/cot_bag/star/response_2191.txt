Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: 6, 7  
Node 1: 8  
Node 2: 5  
Node 3: 6  
Node 4: 5, 9  
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9  
Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 9  
Node 7: 0, 8  
Node 8: 1, 7  
Node 9: 4, 5, 6  

Now, we need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars and the total number of 3-stars are as follows:
[8]  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>  
<5, (4, 6, 9)>  
<6, (0, 5, 9)>  
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
