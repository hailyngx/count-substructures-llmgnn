Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph. Let's analyze each node to see the 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (1, 3)
- Node 1: Has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 8, 9) -> 1 3-star with node 1
- Node 2: Has 2 neighbors (3, 4)
- Node 3: Has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 9) -> 1 3-star with node 3
- Node 4: Has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 9) -> 1 3-star with node 4
- Node 5: Has 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 6: Has 2 neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 7: Has 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 8: Has 2 neighbors (1, 5)
- Node 9: Has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 4)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1] = 3.

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>
