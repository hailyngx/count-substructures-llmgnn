Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list out the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 2: 1, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 8
Node 6: 1, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <2, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 3: No 3-star (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 6: No 3-star (exactly 3 neighbors)
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <7, (1, 2, 9)>
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>
Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>
