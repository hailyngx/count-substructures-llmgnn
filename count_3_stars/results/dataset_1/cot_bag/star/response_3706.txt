Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors) -> <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors) -> <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) -> <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
