Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph visually:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify which nodes have at least three neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star
- Node 7 can form 3 3-stars
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5

Thus, the final answer is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
