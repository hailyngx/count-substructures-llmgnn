Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form. Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 9).
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8).
   - Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8).
   - Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 3)>.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
