Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of $4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14$ 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 2, 4>
- <0, 1, 2, 7>
- <0, 1, 4, 7>
- <0, 2, 4, 7>
- <4, 2, 7, 7>
- <4, 2, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 5, 7>
- <0, 4, 2, 8>
- <0, 4, 7, 8>
- <0, 2, 7, 8>
- <4, 2, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 5, 5>
