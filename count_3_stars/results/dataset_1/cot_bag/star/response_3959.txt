Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars from each such node.

Here are the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 8)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 5, 9)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Three 3-stars from Node 0: [3]
    <0, (2, 7, 9)>
    <0, (3, 7, 9)>
    <0, (7, 5, 9)>
  
- One 3-star from Node 1: [1]
    <1, (4, 5, 8)>

- One 3-star from Node 3: [1]
    <3, (0, 6, 8)>

- Three 3-stars from Node 5: [3]
    <5, (1, 4, 7)>
    <5, (1, 7, 9)>
    <5, (4, 7, 9)>

- One 3-star from Node 7: [1]
    <7, (0, 5, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 
\[ [3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1] = [9] \]
