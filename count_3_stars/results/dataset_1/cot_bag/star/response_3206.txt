Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has neighbors: {2, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2 has neighbors: {1, 5, 8}
Node 3 has neighbors: {4, 6, 7}
Node 4 has neighbors: {3, 5, 9}
Node 5 has neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 8}
Node 6 has neighbors: {1, 3, 7}
Node 7 has neighbors: {1, 3, 6}
Node 8 has neighbors: {2, 5}
Node 9 has neighbors: {1, 4}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (4, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
