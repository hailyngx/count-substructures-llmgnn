Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the provided information:
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Edges: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
1. Node 1: has neighbors 2, 4, 7, 8 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
2. Node 4: has neighbors 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
3. Node 6: has neighbors 4, 5, 9 -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
4. Node 7: has neighbors 1, 4, 5, 9 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
5. Node 8: has neighbors 1, 4, 9 -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
6. Node 9: has neighbors 6, 7, 8 -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>.
