Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6. So it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7. So it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9. So it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 9. So it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8. So it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7. So it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8. So it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>
