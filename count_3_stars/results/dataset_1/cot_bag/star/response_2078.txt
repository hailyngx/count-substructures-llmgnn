Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
   - inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8
   - inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
   - inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
   - inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 9
   - There is only 1 3-star
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8
   - inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
   - inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
   - There is only 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are [44] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
