Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 26 \)

So, the final answer is: [26]

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>
