Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 1: has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of \( 35 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 84 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 7)>,
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
