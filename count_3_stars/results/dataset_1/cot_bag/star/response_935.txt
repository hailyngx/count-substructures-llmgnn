Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes for potential 3-stars are nodes 3, 4, and 5 because they all have three or more neighbors, and nodes 3 and 4 have exactly three neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7. Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered at node 3. 
  This 3-star is: <3, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9. Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 4. 
  These 3-stars are: <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7. Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered at node 5. 
  This 3-star is: <5, (2, 4, 7)>

There are a total of 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
