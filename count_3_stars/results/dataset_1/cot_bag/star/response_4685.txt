Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8.

For node 0, there are 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8. Thus, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.

For node 2, there are 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8. Thus, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.

For node 4, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8. Thus, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.

For node 7, there are 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8. Thus, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 7.

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 2. Thus, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4] = 48 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
