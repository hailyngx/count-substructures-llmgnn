Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8 (5 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 5, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 5 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2 (1 neighbor)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3 (3 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- For Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- For Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- For Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- For Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- For Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>.
