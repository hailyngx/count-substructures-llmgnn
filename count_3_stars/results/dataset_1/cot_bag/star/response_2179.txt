Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
We start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for potential 3-stars.  
For node 0, we have 5 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7, 8), which is enough to form 10 3-stars.  
For node 2, we have 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), which is just enough to form 1 3-star.  
For node 3, we have 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9), which is just enough to form 1 3-star.  
For node 6, we have 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 8), which is enough to form 4 3-stars.  
For node 7, we have 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8), which is enough to form 4 3-stars.  
For node 8, we have 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7, 9), which is enough to form 10 3-stars.  
Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
