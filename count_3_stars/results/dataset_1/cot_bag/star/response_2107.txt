Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 5

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of 5 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 6)>.
