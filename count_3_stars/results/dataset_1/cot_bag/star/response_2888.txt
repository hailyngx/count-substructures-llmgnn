Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed as pairs of nodes connected by an edge. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Only Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
