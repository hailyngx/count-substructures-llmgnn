Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 9
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 3 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 14 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 8, 2)>
