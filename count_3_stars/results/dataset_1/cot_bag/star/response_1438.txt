Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first represent the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 6),
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8),
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9),
(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6),
(4, 2),
(5, 3), (5, 8),
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3),
(8, 1), (8, 5),
(9, 2)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 8), so it can form (5 choose 3) = 10 3-stars.
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 9), so it can form (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars.
<2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6), so it can form (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars.
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 8), so it can form (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars.
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (1, 5), which is not enough to form any 3-star.

By summing up the total, we get:
[10 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) + 0 (from node 8)] = 22

Therefore, there are 22 3-stars in this graph.
