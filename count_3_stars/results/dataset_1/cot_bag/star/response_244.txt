Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 2
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30

So, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
