Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's create the graph:

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has neighbors {3, 4, 6}, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: has neighbors {0, 1, 9}, so it can form 1 3-star. <6, (0, 1, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>.
