Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 53\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (4, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 0, 1)>
<7, (6, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 2, 6)>
<9, (4, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (6, 0, 5)>
