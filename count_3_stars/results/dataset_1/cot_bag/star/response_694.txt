Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph provided, let's first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
