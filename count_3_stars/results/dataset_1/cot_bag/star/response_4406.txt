Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to node 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 9 is connected to node 3

Let's now identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0:
  - Total 3-stars: [1]
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 8)>

- Node 3:
  - Total 3-stars: [2]
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 4:
  - Total 3-stars: [1]
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
