Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 1 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>.
