Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

```
    0 --- 4         8
     \    |         |
      \   |         |
       \  |         |
        \ |         |
          6          1  
                  /   \
                 /     \
                2 ----- 9
               /|\     /|\
                |      |
                3      7
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - The 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center are: <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>.
- Similarly, node 3 and node 4 can each form 1 3-star.
    - The 3-stars with node 3 as the center are: <3, (2, 4, 9)>.
    - The 3-stars with node 4 as the center are: <4, (0, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6. 
  
List of unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>.

So, the final result is [6].
