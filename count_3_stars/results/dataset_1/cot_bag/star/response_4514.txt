Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up these values gives us a total of 42 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>
