Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 7 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [35 + 1 + 20] = 56 \)

Therefore, the final result is: [56]
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>.
