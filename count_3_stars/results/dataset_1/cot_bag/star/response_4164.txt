Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 9.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 2 3-stars.

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of [19] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
