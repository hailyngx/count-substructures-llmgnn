Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for potential 3-stars. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 21
  
Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>
