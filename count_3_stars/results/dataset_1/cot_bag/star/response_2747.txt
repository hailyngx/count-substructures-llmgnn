Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>.
