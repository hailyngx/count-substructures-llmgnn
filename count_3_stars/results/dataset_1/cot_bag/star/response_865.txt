Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: {(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8)}

Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (0, 8, 9)>  
<1, (5, 7, 8)>  
<1, (5, 9, 4)>  
<1, (7, 2, 9)>  
<2, (4, 6, 9)>  
<4, (2, 6, 7)>  
<4, (5, 6, 9)>  
<5, (1, 3, 4)>  
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
