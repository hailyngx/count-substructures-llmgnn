Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Considering only the nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 3-stars in the graph.
So, the final count of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (4, 1, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 6)>
<9, (1, 8, 6)>
