Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 7

Hence, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
