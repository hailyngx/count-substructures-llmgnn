Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Edges: {(1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 1), (9, 4)}

Now, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and compute the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7) => [1]
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 4) => [1]
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9) => [1]
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Summing up the number of 3-stars formed at each relevant node gives us a total of [3] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, and <4, (2, 3, 9)>
