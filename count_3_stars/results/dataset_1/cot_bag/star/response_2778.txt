Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Let's analyze each node to see which ones can form 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 0: Can form <0, (3, 4, 7)> and <0, (3, 4, 7)> => 2 3-stars
- Node 2: Can form <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, and <2, (5, 6, 8)> => 3 3-stars
- Node 3: Can form <3, (0, 1, 8)> => 1 3-star
- Node 4: Can form <4, (0, 6, 8)> => 1 3-star
- Node 7: Can form <7, (0, 5, 9)> => 1 3-star
- Node 8: Can form <8, (2, 3, 4)> => 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, and <7, (0, 5, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
