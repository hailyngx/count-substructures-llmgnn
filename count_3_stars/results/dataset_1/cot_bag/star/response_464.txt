Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9. 

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8, 9). So, the total number of 3-stars centered at node 0 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). 
The unique 3-stars centered at node 0 are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)> <0, (1, 5, 8)> <0, (1, 6, 8)> <0, (5, 6, 8)> <0, (1, 6, 9)> <0, (1, 8, 9)> <0, (5, 6, 9)> <0, (5, 8, 9)> <0, (6, 8, 9)> <0, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 1: 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 8). So, the total number of 3-stars centered at node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
The unique 3-stars centered at node 1 is: 
<1, (0, 3, 5)>

For node 5: 
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 9). So, the total number of 3-stars centered at node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
The unique 3-stars centered at node 5 is: 
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 5). So, the total number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
The unique 3-star centered at node 9 is: 
<9, (0, 5, 1)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [10 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [19].
