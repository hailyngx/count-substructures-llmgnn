Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 21 \)

Therefore, the final answer is: [21]

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 4)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>
