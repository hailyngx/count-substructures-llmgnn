Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
This graph consists of the following edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, and 6.
  
Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 7 \).
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 3, 4, 7>
<4, 1, 2, 6>
<6, 4, 7, 8>
<7, 0, 1, 5>
<7, 0, 1, 6>
<7, 0, 4, 6>
<7, 1, 5, 6>
