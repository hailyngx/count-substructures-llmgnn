Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's analyze each node to see if they form 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has neighbors 6, 8, and 9.
    - Total 3-stars from node 0: [1]
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1 has neighbors 4 and 6.
    - Total 3-stars from node 1: [0]

3. Node 2 has neighbors 3, 4, 6, and 7.
    - Total 3-stars from node 2: [1]
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 7)>

4. Node 3 has neighbors 2, 7, and 8.
    - Total 3-stars from node 3: [1]
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 7, 8)>

5. Node 4 has neighbors 1 and 2.
    - Total 3-stars from node 4: [0]

6. Node 6 has neighbors 0, 1, 2.
    - Total 3-stars from node 6: [3]
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 2)>

7. Node 7 has neighbors 2 and 3.
    - Total 3-stars from node 7: [0]

8. Node 8 has neighbors 0 and 3.
    - Total 3-stars from node 8: [0]

9. Node 9 has neighbor 0.
    - Total 3-stars from node 9: [0]

In total, there are [1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0] = [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, and <3, (2, 7, 8)>.
