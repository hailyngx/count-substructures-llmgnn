Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6)}

Now, we'll identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17]. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>
