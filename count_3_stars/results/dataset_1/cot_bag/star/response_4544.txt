Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes, let's examine each node to see if they have three or more neighbors, which would allow the formation of 3-stars.

Node 0: Has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9) - can form 1 3-star.  
Node 1: Has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 7) - can form 1 3-star.  
Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7) - can form 1 3-star.  
Node 3: Has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7, 8) - can form 10 3-stars.  
Node 4: Has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 8) - can form 1 3-star.  
Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6) - can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 6: Has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 9) - can form 4 3-stars.  
Node 7: Has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 6) - can form 10 3-stars.  
Node 8: Has 2 neighbors (3, 4) - cannot form any 3-star.  
Node 9: Has 2 neighbors (0, 6) - cannot form any 3-star.  

Summing up the total, we have \(1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32\) 3-stars formed in this graph.  

So, the total number of 3-stars is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 7, 9)>  
<1, (5, 6, 7)>  
<2, (3, 5, 7)>  
<3, (0, 2, 4)>  
<3, (0, 4, 8)>  
<3, (2, 4, 8)>   
<3, (4, 5, 8)>   
<3, (4, 5, 6)>  
<3, (3, 7, 6)>  
<3, (7, 6, 1)>  
<7, (0, 2, 3)>  
<7, (1, 2, 6)>  
<7, (1, 2, 5)>  
<7, (1, 5, 6)>  
<7, (2, 5, 6)>  
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
