Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (4, 9, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (4, 3, 5)>
<4, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
