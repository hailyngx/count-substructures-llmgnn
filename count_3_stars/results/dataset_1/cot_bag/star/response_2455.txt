Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (3, 7, 6)>
<3, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 3)>
