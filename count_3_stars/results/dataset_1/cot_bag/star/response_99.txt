Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
   1 --- 7       6 --- 2
   |         \   /         \
   |          6             9
   |         /   \         /
   0 --- 2       3 --- 8
   |         \   /
   |          4
   |         /   \
   4 --- 0       5
```

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  - <0, (1, 2, 3)> 
  - <0, (2, 6, 4)> 
  - <0, (3, 5, 9)> 
  - <0, (4, 1, 0)>

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  - <2, (6, 3, 9)>
  
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 5, 9)> 
  - <3, (0, 6, 8)> 
  - <3, (0, 6, 2)> 
  - <3, (0, 9, 5)> 
  - <3, (5, 9, 2)> 
  - <3, (6, 7, 0)> 
  - <3, (6, 2, 0)> 
  - <3, (6, 2, 9)> 
  - <3, (6, 7, 1)> 
  - <3, (8, 6, 2)> 
  
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  - <6, (3, 7, 2)>
  
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  - <9, (5, 3, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 17.
