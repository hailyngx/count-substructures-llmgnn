Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star structure. Here's the breakdown:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 3, and 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: nodes 1 and 5. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 5, and 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: node 9. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 5, and 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars we can form: 1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 9) = 22.

So, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in this graph.
