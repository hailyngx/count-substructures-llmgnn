Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 2
    |         |
    9         3 -- 4 -- 5
              |    |    |
              7    8    |
                          

```

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
No 3-stars are formed for node 9.

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
The unique 3-stars involving node 1 are <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, and <1, (4, 7, 8)>.

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
The unique 3-stars involving node 4 are <4, (2, 3, 8)> and <4, (5, 7, 8)>.

No 3-stars are formed for node 5, node 2, node 3, node 7, or node 8.

Summing these up: 1 + 10 + 10 = 21

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].
