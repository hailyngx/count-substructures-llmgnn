Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we'll construct the graph based on the provided information:

The nodes are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
The edges are {(0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)}.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 6}
Node 3 has neighbors: {1, 5, 8, 9}
Node 6 has neighbors: {1, 7, 8, 9}
Node 8 has neighbors: {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding all these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 4)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 5)>
<3, (5, 1, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (7, 1, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 1)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
