Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we'll construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 7)

Next, we'll identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: Neighbors = 2
Node 1: Neighbors = 2
Node 2: Neighbors = 2
Node 3: Neighbors = 4
Node 4: Neighbors = 2
Node 5: Neighbors = 2
Node 6: Neighbors = 3
Node 7: Neighbors = 2
Node 8: Neighbors = 4
Node 9: Neighbors = 1

Calculating the total number of 3-stars using the formula for nodes with three or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 0, 8)>, <6, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 0, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 0)>, <8, (6, 0, 3)>
