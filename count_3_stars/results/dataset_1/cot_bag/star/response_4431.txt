Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
        
         0 - 8
         |
         1 - 2 - 3
        /|  |   |
       6 4  9   5
         |
         7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph. 
For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node as the center.

For node 1: 
No 3-star is formed as it has only 2 neighbors.

For node 2: 
There are 4 neighbors. 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>

For node 3: 
No 3-star is formed as it has only 2 neighbors.

For node 4: 
There are 2 neighbors. 
Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 5: 
No 3-star is formed as it has only 1 neighbor.

For node 6: 
No 3-star is formed as it has only 1 neighbor.

For node 7: 
No 3-star is formed as it has only 1 neighbor.

For node 8: 
No 3-star is formed as it has only 1 neighbor.

For node 9: 
There are 2 neighbors. 
Number of 3-stars = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4] = 4 \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>
