Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors (1, 6)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (2, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7)

For Node 0:
There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0 since it has less than 3 neighbors.

For Node 4:
There are no 3-stars centered at Node 4 since it has less than 3 neighbors.

For Node 6:
There is 1 3-star centered at Node 6: <6, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there is a total of [1] 3-star in the graph, which is <6, (0, 5, 7)>.
