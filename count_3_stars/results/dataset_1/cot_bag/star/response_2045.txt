Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's examine each node to see which ones have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 7, 9
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 3, 6
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6

Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up these values, we get a total of: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
