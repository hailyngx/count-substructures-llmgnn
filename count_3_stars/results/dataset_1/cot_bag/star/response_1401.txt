Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 5
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 4

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up these counts: 

\[ [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [12] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
