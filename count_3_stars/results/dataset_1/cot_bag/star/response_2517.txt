Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first draw the graph to visualize it. The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are specified as given.

The graph consists of the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to node 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6

From the graph, we can see that the nodes forming 3-stars are 1, 3, 5, and 6. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, 6, 9, 3>, <3, 1, 6, 8>, and <5, 0, 9, 6>.
