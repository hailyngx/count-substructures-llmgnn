Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 4 and node 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier.

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4] = [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
