Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of 29 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
