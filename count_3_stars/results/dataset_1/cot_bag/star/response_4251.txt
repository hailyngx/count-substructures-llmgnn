Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 6

We will now calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 7, 9: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 7: <2, (3, 5, 7)>

Putting this together, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
