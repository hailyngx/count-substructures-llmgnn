Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 5 neighbors of node 0, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0. 
- Node 1: There are 7 neighbors of node 1, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars formed with node 1. 
- Node 3: There are 5 neighbors of node 3, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.
- Node 4: There are 4 neighbors of node 4, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 4. 
- Node 8: There are 4 neighbors of node 8, so there is 1 3-star formed with node 8.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 57 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
