Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if they can form a 3-star:

Node 0: has 2 neighbors
Node 2: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
Node 3: has 2 neighbors
Node 4: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
Node 5: has 2 neighbors
Node 6: has 1 neighbor
Node 7: has 1 neighbor
Node 8: has 1 neighbor
Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 3, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
