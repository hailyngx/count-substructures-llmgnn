Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 (Neighbors: 5, 7, 9)
- Node 2 (Neighbors: 1, 8)
- Node 3 (Neighbors: 7, 8)
- Node 4 (Neighbors: 7, 9)
- Node 5 (Neighbors: 0, 8)
- Node 7 (Neighbors: 0, 3, 4)
- Node 8 (Neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 9)
- Node 9 (Neighbors: 0, 4, 8)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
