Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: has 3 neighbors
Node 1: has 3 neighbors
Node 7: has 5 neighbors
Node 8: has 2 neighbors
Node 9: has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: Node 8 doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
Node 9: Node 9 doesn't have 3 or more neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 1) + 10 (from Node 7) = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 3)>,
<7, (0, 1, 4)>,
<7, (0, 3, 4)>,
<7, (1, 3, 4)>,
<7, (1, 3, 9)>,
<7, (3, 4, 9)>,
<7, (4, 9, 6)>,
<7, (9, 6, 8)>,
<7, (6, 8, 1)>.
