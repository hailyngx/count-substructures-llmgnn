Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. 

For node 0:  
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
<0, (1, 2, 3)>  
<0, (1, 2, 7)>  
<0, (1, 3, 4)>  
<0, (1, 7, 5)>  

For node 1:  
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  

For node 2:  
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
<2, (0, 4, 5)>  

For node 3:  
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
<3, (0, 4, 5)>  

For node 4:  
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
<4, (2, 3, 8)>  
<4, (2, 9, 5)>  
<4, (3, 5, 8)>  
<4, (3, 9, 8)>  

For node 5:  
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>  
<5, (2, 6, 8)>  
<5, (2, 7, 6)>  
<5, (2, 7, 8)>  
<5, (3, 7, 6)>  
<5, (4, 7, 6)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  
<5, (4, 8, 6)>  
<5, (6, 8, 7)>  
<5, (7, 8, 6)>  

For node 8:  
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
<8, (4, 5, 6)>  

Adding them up:  
4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 22  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [ 22 ].
