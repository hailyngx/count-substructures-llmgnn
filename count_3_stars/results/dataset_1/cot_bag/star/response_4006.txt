Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19 \).

\[ [19] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
