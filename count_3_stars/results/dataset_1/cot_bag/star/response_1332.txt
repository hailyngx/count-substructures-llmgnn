Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 23

Therefore, there are 23 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>.
