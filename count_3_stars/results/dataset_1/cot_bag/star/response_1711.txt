Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this network are as follows:

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
