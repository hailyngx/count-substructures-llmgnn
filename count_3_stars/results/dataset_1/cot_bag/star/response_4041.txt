Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Nodes 1, 2, and 6 have three or more neighbors; hence, they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate how many 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 10] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
