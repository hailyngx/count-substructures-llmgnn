Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

Given the number of nodes and edges, we can start by calculating the maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 10 nodes. 
The formula for the maximum number of edges in a simple graph with n nodes is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). 
For n=10, the maximum number of edges = 45.

As the graph given has 30 edges, it means there are missing edges and some nodes may have degree less than 3.

Let's identify the nodes with degree less than 3:
- Node 0 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 2

The remaining nodes have degree at least 3, so we can check the 3-stars for them.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has degree 4, meaning it can form 1 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has degree 4, meaning it can form 1 3-star.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has degree 3, meaning it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has degree 4, meaning it can form 1 3-star.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has degree 3, meaning it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has degree 3, meaning it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has degree 5, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: 
\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16 \)

So, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
