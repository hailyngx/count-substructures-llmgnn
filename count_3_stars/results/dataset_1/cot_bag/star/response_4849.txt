Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. 
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 9: Doesn't have 3 or more neighbors.

Adding up the 3-stars gives a total of 10 3-stars.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 5)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 5)>
<6, (4, 9, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 3)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 9, 6)>
