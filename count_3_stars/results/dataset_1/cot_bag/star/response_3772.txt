Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 1: 4, 5, 9
Node 3: 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 6, 8
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 = 2.

Therefore, the final answer is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 5, 9)> and <4, (1, 6, 8)>.
