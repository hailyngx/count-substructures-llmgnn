Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: node 2, node 4, node 6, node 9.   

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars 

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
