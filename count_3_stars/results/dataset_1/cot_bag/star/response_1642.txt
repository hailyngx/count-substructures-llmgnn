Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6

From the list of neighbors above, we can find the 3-stars and count them:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 58

So, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>
