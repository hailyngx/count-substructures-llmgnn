Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
From the provided information, we can draw the following graph:

```
     0 --- 3     1 --- 4      2 --- 6
     |     |     |     |      |     |
     5 --- 8     8 --- 9      8 --- 4
```

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Since nodes 0, 4, and 8 have more than 3 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [15]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (8, 4, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>.
