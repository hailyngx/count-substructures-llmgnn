Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
- Node 1 and Node 4 have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 have more than 3 neighbors. Hence, the number of 3-stars they form using their neighbors is given by \( \binom{d}{3} \), where d is the degree of the node.

Calculating for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up these results, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 21 3-stars in total. Thus, the final result is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 1, 9)>, <4, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 2, 6)>, <3, (6, 2, 3)>, <5, (7, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 6, 4)>
