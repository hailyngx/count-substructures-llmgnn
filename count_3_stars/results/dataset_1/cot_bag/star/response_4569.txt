Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Adding up the 3-stars that can be formed, we get a total of 16 3-stars:

\[ [16] \]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (6, 5, 8)>, 
<7, (6, 8, 5)>, 
<6, (8, 7, 5)>, 
<7, (8, 6, 5)>, 
<7, (8, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (8, 5, 7)>
