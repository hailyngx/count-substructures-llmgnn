Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors {0, 6, 8}, so there is 1 3-star with center node 1.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors {4, 8, 9}, so there is 1 3-star with center node 2.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors {2, 7, 8}, so there is 1 3-star with center node 4.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors {4, 5, 8}, so there is 1 3-star with center node 7.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with center node 8.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, and <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
