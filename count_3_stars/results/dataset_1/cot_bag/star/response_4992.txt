Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, potential 3-stars: [<1, (2, 4, 7)>]
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, potential 3-stars: [<3, (0, 1, 8)>]
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, potential 3-stars: [<4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 5, 9)>]
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, potential 3-stars: [<8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>]
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, potential 3-stars: [<9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 12 3-stars formed, and the total number of 3-stars is [12].
