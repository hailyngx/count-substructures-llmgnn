Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are labeled from 0 to 9. Here are the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {1}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 4, 5}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of [18] 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (8, 6, 3)>, <8, (6, 3, 5)>, <9, (4, 1, 5)>.
