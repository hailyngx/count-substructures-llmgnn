Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 5.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>.

Putting it all together, we have:
Total number of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
