Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors first:

- Node 0: neighbors 6, 9
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: neighbors 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: neighbors 2, 4
- Node 4: neighbors 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: neighbor 1
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: neighbor 9
- Node 8: neighbor 6
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 1, 4, 6, 7

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms the 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms the 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms the 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 4)>

There are a total of 3 3-stars in this graph, so the final count is [3].
