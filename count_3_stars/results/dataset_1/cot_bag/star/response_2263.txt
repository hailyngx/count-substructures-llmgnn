Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
0 -- 1
|     |
9     3 -- 5 -- 7
     |     |     |
     9     6     9
           |
           4 -- 8
```
Let's analyze each node to see which ones form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 5: Forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 6: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9: Forms 2 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, 1, 9>, <3, 5, 7>, <5, 3, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 5, 7>.
