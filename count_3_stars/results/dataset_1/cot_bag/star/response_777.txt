Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 3, node 4, node 7, and node 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the given graph.
