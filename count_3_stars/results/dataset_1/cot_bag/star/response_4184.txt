Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \), so we write this as [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
