Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's go through each node:

- Node 1 has 8 neighbors: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 0, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>

There are 5 possible 3-stars formed with node 1.

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>

There are 4 possible 3-stars formed with node 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5 + 4] = [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 0, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>
