Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6

Let's find the 3-stars now:  
For node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
For node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
For node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
For node 6: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)  
For node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
For node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
For node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 15
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
