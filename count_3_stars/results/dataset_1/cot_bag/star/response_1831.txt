Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph using the method described earlier.

Nodes with their neighbors:
0: 4
1: 2, 5, 7, 9
2: 1, 3, 6
3: 2, 4
4: 0, 3, 7
5: 1, 9
6: 2, 8
7: 1, 4
8: 6
9: 1, 5

Now, let's go through each node to count the number of 3-stars:

- For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 3: No 3-stars can be formed.
- For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 5: No 3-stars can be formed.
- For node 6: No 3-stars can be formed.
- For node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
- For node 8: No 3-stars can be formed.
- For node 9: No 3-stars can be formed.

Summing up the total 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (7, 4, 0)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 4)>
