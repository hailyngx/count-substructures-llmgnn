Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 7, 8), forming 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes, we get a total of 7 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
