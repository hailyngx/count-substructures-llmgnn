Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

This graph has the following nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 1] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>
<8, (9, 2, 3)>
