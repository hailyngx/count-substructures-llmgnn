Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars identified are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
