Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

0: 1  
1: 0, 7  
2: 4, 8  
3: 4  
4: 2, 3, 8  
5: 9  
7: 1, 9  
8: 2, 4  
9: 5, 7  

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
Node 7: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([6]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 0, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 1)>
