Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

We will now find the 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 6, 8)>

There are 2 3-stars found based on the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
