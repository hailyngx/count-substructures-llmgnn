Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 44\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 1, 3)>, <4, (2, 9, 1)>, <4, (3, 2, 1)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].
