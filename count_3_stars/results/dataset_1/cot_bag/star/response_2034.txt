Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges, we will first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 4), (8, 0), (9, 3)

Now, we will find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 6) => 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 9, 6) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (3, 6) => 0 3-stars
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (1, 4) => 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 = 5
So, the final answer is [5].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
