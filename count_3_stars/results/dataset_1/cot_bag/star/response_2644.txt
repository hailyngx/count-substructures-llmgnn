Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (since it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 8, 2)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, 4)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 7, 2)>
