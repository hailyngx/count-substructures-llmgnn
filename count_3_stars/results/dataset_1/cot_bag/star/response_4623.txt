Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we need to determine the total number of 3-stars and list them uniquely. 

Let's analyze the nodes based on their degrees:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with degrees 3 or more:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
