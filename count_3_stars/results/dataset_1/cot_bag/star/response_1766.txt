Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
Node 0: 6, 8
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 8
Node 5: 6
Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 7
Node 7: 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 7, 9
Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's go through each node to identify the number of 3-stars they are part of:
Node 6: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 7: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
Node 8: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is \(4 + 1 + 4 = 9\).
So, the answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
