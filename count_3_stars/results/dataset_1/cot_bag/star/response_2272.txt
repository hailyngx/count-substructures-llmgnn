Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
Node 0 has 4 neighbors
Node 1 has 4 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 6 neighbors
Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 40
So, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (7, 2, 8)>
<0, (8, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 0, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 0, 1)>
<2, (7, 0, 8)>
<2, (8, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 5)>
<8, (4, 0, 5)>
<8, (5, 1, 9)>
<8, (8, 4, 9)>
<8, (9, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 8, 5)>
