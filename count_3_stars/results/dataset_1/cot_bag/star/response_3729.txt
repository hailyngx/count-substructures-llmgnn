Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the information provided:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 0), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8 -> [1 3-star]
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6 -> [1 3-star]
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7 -> [1 3-star]
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9 -> [1 3-star]
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7 -> [1 3-star]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
