Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.  

For node 0, there are 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 2, there are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 3, there are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 4, there are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 5, there are 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.  
For node 6, there are 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-stars.  
For node 7, there are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.  
For node 9, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

Adding these up:  
\[ 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17 \]
So, there are 17 3-stars in the graph.  

Therefore, the answer is [17].  

The 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (3, 4, 6)>  
<0, (3, 4, 7)>  
<0, (3, 6, 9)>  
<0, (3, 7, 9)>  
<0, (4, 6, 9)>  
<0, (4, 7, 9)>  
<3, (0, 2, 9)>  
<4, (0, 2, 7)>  
<7, (0, 4, 5)>  
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
