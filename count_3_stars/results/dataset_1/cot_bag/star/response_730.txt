Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0: Has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9). => [1] 3-star
Node 1: Has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7). => [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-stars
Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9). => [1] 3-star
Node 3: Has 2 neighbors (1, 8). => No 3-star
Node 5: Has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8). => [1] 3-star
Node 6: Has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 8, 9). => [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-stars
Node 7: Has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8). => [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-stars
Node 8: Has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7). => [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-stars
Node 9: Has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6). => [1] 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [20]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 2)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 2)>.
