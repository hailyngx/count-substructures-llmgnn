Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 18 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 7)>,
<1, (5, 6, 9)>,
<1, (5, 7, 9)>,
<1, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (7, 8, 9)>,
<3, (4, 6, 8)>,
<6, (7, 1, 3)>, 
<7, (2, 6, 1)>,
<9, (0, 2, 5)>,
<9, (2, 5, 0)>,
<9, (2, 5, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is stated as [18].
