Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 4

Let's count the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these together: \( [1 + 4 + 1] = 6 \)

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
