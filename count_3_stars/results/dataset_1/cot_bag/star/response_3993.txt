Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: Only connected to node 7. (0, 7)
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 6. (1, 2) (1, 6)
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9. (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9)
4. Node 3: Connected to node 6. (3, 6)
5. Node 4: Connected to node 2. (4, 2)
6. Node 5: Connected to node 2. (5, 2)
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8. (1, 6) (3, 6) (6, 8)
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 8)
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 6, 7. (6, 8) (7, 8)
10. Node 9: Connected to node 2. (9, 2)

Based on the analysis above, node 2 and node 7 have 5 neighbors.
For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1] = 11 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 6)>
<7, (2, 8, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<(1, 2, 6)>
