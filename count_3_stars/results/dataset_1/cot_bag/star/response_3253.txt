Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first construct the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges as described:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6)
(1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9)
(2, 4), (2, 9)
(3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 8)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9)
(5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7)
(6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)
(7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6)
(8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6)
(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the central nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28

Thus, there are 28 3-stars in this graph.
  
[28]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
