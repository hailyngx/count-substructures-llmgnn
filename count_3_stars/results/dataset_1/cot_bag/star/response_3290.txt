Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 2 neighbors (3, 4), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: It has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: It has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 2 neighbors (1, 3), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (1, 4), so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors (3, 4), so it does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 7) = 22.

So, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 4, 6, 7>
<3, 0, 2, 5>
<3, 0, 2, 9>
<3, 0, 5, 9>
<3, 2, 5, 9>
<4, 0, 1, 6>
<4, 0, 1, 7>
<4, 0, 6, 7>
<4, 1, 6, 7>
<7, 1, 4, 8>
