Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes is a part of.

Nodes 0, 3, 5, 8 have 4 neighbors each, while nodes 2 and 7 have 3 neighbors each. Nodes 1, 4, 6, 9 have 1 or 2 neighbors and thus do not form any 3-stars.

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [15].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>.
