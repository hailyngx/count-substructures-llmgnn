Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 9, 2)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16].
