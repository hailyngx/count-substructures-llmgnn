Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 3), (1, 6), and (1, 7). 
So, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 1: <1, (3, 6, 7)>.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 3), (2, 8), and (2, 9). 
So, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 2: <2, (3, 8, 9)>.

Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), and (3, 9). 
So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 3. The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), and (4, 5). 
So, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 4: <4, (3, 6, 9)>.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), and (5, 8). 
So, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 5: <5, (3, 6, 7)>.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), and (6, 7). 
So, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 6: <6, (1, 4, 5)>.

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 6), and (7, 8). 
So, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 7: <7, (1, 5, 6)>.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), and (8, 7). 
So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8. The unique 3-stars are <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>.

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 2), (9, 3), and (9, 4). 
So, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 9: <9, (2, 3, 4)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 37.
