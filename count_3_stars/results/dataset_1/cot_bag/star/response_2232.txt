Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph and list them, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each such node.

Node 0 has neighbors 1, 4, and 5, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 4, 5)>

Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, and 9, so it can form 1 3-star. <1, (0, 2, 9)>

Node 2 has neighbors 1, 4, and 8, so it can form 1 3-star. <2, (1, 4, 8)>

Node 4 has neighbors 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8, so it can form 1 3-star. <4, (0, 2, 8)>

Node 5 has neighbors 0, 4, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 8 has neighbors 2, 4, and 9, so it can form 1 3-star. <8, (2, 4, 9)>

Node 9 has neighbors 1, 3, 8, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
