Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 9):
- Number of 3-stars with Node 0 as the center: inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 8, 9):
- Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: inom{5}{3} = 10

Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 8):
- Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8):
- Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5):
- Number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: inom{4}{3} = 4

Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 8, 9):
- Number of 3-stars with Node 6 as the center: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get:
4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 5, 0)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (8, 0, 9)>
