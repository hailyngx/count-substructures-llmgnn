Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors are 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: neighbors are 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 5

Now we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [14] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 5, 1)>
- <9, (0, 5, 2)>
- <9, (1, 5, 2)>
