Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 3.

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 6, 9)>.
