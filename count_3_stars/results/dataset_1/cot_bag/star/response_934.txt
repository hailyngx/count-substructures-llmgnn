Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for the node.

Below are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7. There is 1 3-star formed with node 2.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 9. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 9. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5. There is 1 3-star formed with node 9.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 20 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 7, 4)>
- <4, (2, 9, 5)>
- <5, (4, 9, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
