Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 1  
Node 1: 0  
Node 2: 6, 9  
Node 3: 4, 5  
Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 2, 4  
Node 7: 4, 9  
Node 8: 4  
Node 9: 2, 7  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2: 1 3-star  
- Node 4: 4 3-stars  
- Node 7: 1 3-star  
- Node 9: 1 3-star  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <2, (6, 9, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 8, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (4, 9, 2)>
- <9, (2, 7, 4)>
