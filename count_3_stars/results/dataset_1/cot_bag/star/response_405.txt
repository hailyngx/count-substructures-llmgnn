Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1] = 5

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 1)>
