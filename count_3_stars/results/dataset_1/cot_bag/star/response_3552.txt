Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are 18 unique 3-stars in the graph. They are:
