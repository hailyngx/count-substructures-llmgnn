Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 1 neighbor
Node 3 has 1 neighbor
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 5 has 1 neighbor
Node 6 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 2 neighbors
Node 8 has 2 neighbors
Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that have at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star
Node 6 forms 1 3-star
Node 7 forms 1 3-star
Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Putting the unique 3-stars in order, we have:
[4]

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
