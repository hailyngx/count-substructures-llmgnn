Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be visually represented as follows:

0 --- 8
 \     | 
  \    | 
   \   | 
    1  |
     \ |
      7
 
2 --- 6
 \     | 
  \    | 
   \   | 
    9  |
     \ |
      8
       
      3
     / \
    1   5
     \
      8
       
      4
     / \
    6   5
   /     \
  2       8

Based on the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 8: <2, (6, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <3, (1, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
