Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the following graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 6 has neighbor: 4
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 16

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>
