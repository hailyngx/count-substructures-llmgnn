Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 5, and 7.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate \( \binom{k}{3} \), where \( k \) is the number of neighbors for that node. 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Adding these up, we find there are a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
