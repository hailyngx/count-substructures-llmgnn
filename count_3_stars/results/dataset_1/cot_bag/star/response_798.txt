Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 8), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 4)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
