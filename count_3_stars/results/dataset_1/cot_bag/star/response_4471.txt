Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 8, 9
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 7
Node 4: 2, 5, 8
Node 5: 2, 4, 7
Node 6: 9
Node 7: 2, 3, 5
Node 8: 0, 2, 4
Node 9: 0, 6

By applying the formula described earlier, the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors is as follows:

Node 0: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 7: [1]
Node 8: [1]

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 2)>
