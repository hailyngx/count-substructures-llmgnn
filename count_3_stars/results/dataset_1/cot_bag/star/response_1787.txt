Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
