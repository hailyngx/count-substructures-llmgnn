Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9. We can form 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, and 9. We can form 1 3-star with node 4: <4, (6, 7, 8)>.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 7. We can form 1 3-star with node 6: <6, (0, 4, 7)>.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, and 8. We can form 1 3-star with node 7: <7, (4, 5, 8)>.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 5. We can form 1 3-star with node 9: <9, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
