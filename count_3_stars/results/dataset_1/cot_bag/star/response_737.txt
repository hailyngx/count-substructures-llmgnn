Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the previous information:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results gives us a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 3-stars.  
Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
