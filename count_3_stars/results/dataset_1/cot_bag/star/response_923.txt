Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5) so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9) so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5) so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6) so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (5, 9) which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (1, 8) which is less than 3.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 6) which is less than 3.

Therefore, there are a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 3-stars in this graph.   

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 6)>  

So the final answer is [7].
