Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list how many neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 13.

So, the final answer is [13].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (8, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>.
