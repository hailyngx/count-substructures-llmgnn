Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to each node with three or more neighbors:

1. For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
