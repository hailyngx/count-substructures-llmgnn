Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: 1 + 10 + 10 = 21

So, the total number of 3-stars is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
