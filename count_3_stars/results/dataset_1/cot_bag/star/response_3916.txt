Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms any 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7) [4 neighbors, so we have 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars]
    <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>

- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 9) [2 neighbors, no 3-star]

- Node 2: (2, 0) [1 neighbor, no 3-star]

- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8) [3 neighbors, so we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star]
    <3, (1, 5, 8)>

- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 9) [2 neighbors, no 3-star]

- Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 6) [2 neighbors, no 3-star]

- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 5) [2 neighbors, no 3-star]

- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 8), (7, 9) [3 neighbors, so we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star]
    <7, (8, 9, 0)>

- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 7) [2 neighbors, no 3-star]

- Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7) [3 neighbors, so we have 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star]
    <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (8, 9, 0)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
