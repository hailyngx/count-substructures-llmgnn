Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, nodes 1, 5, and 8 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

For node 1:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is 1 3-star centered at node 1.
3-star: <1, (0, 5, 8)>

For node 5:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is 1 3-star centered at node 5.
3-star: <5, (1, 4, 8)>

For node 8:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
There is 1 3-star centered at node 8.
3-star: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, and <8, (0, 1, 5)>.
