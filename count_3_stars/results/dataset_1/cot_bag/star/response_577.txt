Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 2, 4, and 6.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 4: <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars for node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 6) = 24

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
