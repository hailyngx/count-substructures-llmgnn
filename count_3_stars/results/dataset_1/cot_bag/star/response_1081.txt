Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edge list, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 6
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, and 7
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 8)>,
<8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>
