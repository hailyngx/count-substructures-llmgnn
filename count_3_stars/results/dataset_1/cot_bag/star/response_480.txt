Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7 each have 4 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>
