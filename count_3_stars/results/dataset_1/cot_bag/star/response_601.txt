Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
Node 2 has 5 neighbors. 
Node 4 has 4 neighbors. 
Node 5 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 = 24.
Therefore, the final answer is [24].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 5, 9)>
