Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
1. Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5
2. Node 1: 0, 3, 8
3. Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
4. Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
5. Node 4: 2, 8, 9
6. Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
7. Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8
8. Node 7: 3, 8
9. Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
10. Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
4. Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 54

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
