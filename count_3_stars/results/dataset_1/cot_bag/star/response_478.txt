Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 3

Identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, and 9 have 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors but will not form any 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3. 
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
  
Putting the final answer inside brackets gives [3].
