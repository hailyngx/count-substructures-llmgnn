Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 24 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>.
