Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 2 and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
This means there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 2 as the central node. The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>

For node 7:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
This means there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 7 as the central node. The unique 3-stars are: <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 3)>, <7, (3, 2, 5)>, <7, (5, 2, 3)>

Adding these up: 
\[ [10 + 4] = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 14.
