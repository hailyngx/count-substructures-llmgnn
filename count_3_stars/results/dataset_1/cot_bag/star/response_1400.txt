Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 10 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is: [10]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 5, 9>
<0, 2, 6, 9>
<0, 2, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 6, 9>
<2, 0, 5, 6>
<2, 0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 8, 6>
<6, 0, 2, 5>
<6, 0, 2, 9>
<6, 3, 8, 6>
