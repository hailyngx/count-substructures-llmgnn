Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with degree at least 3 are 0, 1, 3, 7. We need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \). Thus, we have 10 3-stars with center 0.

For node 1: There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \). Thus, we have 4 3-stars with center 1.

For node 3: There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \). Thus, we have 10 3-stars with center 3.

For node 7: There are 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars is \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \). Thus, we have 20 3-stars with center 7.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 44.

Therefore, the final result is [44] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (8, 9, 0)>.
