Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
3. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
4. Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
5. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
6. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
7. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
8. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node:
\(4 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 34.
