Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 0-star (0, 4, 8) --> <0, (4, 8)>
- Node 1: 2 3-stars (1, 2, 6) and (1, 6, 7) --> <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 3)>
- Node 2: 3 3-stars (2, 1, 6), (2, 3, 6), and (2, 1, 7) --> <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 3)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>
- Node 3: 0-star (3, 2, 8) --> <3, (2, 8)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 0, 5) --> <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 6: 0-star (6, 1, 2) --> <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 7: 0-star (7, 1, 9) --> <7, (1, 9, 2)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 0, 9) --> <8, (0, 9, 3)>
- Node 9: 0-star (9, 7, 8) --> <9, (7, 8, 1)>

Adding up the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
