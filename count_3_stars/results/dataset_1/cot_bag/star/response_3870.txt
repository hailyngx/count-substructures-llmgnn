Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first draw this graph to visualize it:

```
   1 -- 0 -- 3          9 -- 7
        |               | /
        5               8
         \
          6 -- 4
         /      |
        2       6
               |
               7
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

For nodes 0, 6, and 7, we can form 3-stars using the neighbors connected to them:

- For node 0: [ inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>

- For node 6: [ inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
    - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (2, 7, 4)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 2)>
    - <6, (2, 4, 7)>

- For node 7: [ inom{4}{3} ] = 4 3-stars
    - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 9, 2)>

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final count is [12] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 4)>
- <6, (4, 7, 2)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 9, 2)>
