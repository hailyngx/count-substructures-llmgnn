Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). Let's go through the nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. So, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
