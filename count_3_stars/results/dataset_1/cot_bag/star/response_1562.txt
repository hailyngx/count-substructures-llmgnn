Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed in the graph: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>

So, the final answer is [36]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
