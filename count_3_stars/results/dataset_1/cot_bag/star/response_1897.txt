Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first inspect each node to determine how many neighbors it has. Let's start analyzing each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Based on the number of neighbors, only nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9 can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
