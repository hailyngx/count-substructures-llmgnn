Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 1 neighbor
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22 \), and the unique 3-stars are:

<[1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 5], [1, 4, 7], [1, 8, 5], [2, 5, 7], [2, 5, 8], [4, 5, 7], [5, 7, 8]>
Therefore, the final result is [22].
