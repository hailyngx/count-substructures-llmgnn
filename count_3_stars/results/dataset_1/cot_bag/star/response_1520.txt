Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 8 and 9, so it does not form any 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 7, so it forms 1 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 3, 7, 4 as the leaves. 
  Total number of 3-stars = 1

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 9, and 9, so it forms 1 3-star with node 5 as the center and nodes 3, 9, 9 as the leaves.
  Total number of 3-stars = 1

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 5, so it forms 1 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 0, 2, 5 as the leaves.
  Total number of 3-stars = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1]. The unique 3-star found in the graph is <1, (3, 7, 4)>
