Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph visually to better understand its structure.

The graph can be represented as follows:

```
  0 --- 2
 / \
1--- 7---4
|  /|\
| / | \
|/  |  \
8   |   6
    9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

For each node that has at least 3 neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it forms:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is thus [1 + 4] = [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 4)>, and <7, (4, 6, 9)>.
