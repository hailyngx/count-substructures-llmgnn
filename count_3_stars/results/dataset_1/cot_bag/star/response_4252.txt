Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: Not connected to any other nodes
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
For Node 0: 
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 20 \]
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

For Node 1: 
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 4 \]
<1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>

For Node 3: 
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 1 \]
<3, (8, 9, 5)>

For Node 5: 
\[ \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = 4 \]
<5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [29]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>.
