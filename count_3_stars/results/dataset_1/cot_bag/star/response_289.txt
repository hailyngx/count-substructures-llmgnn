Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28. 

Putting the final count in brackets gives us [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the given graph.
