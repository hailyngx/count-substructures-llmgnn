Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12. 

Therefore, the answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 6)>, <0, (1, 7, 0)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 1)>, <0, (6, 7, 0)>, <0, (0, 1, 7)>, <0, (0, 7, 9)>, <0, (0, 7, 6)>, <0, (1, 9, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 3)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>.
