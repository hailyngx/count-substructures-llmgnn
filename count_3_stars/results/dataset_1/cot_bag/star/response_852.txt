Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: Connected to node 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 4
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 5
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 6
  
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (8, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 0, 5)>
- <4, (2, 1, 7)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
