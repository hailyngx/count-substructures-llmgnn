Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8

Calculating the 3-stars for each applicable node:
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

Hence, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>.
