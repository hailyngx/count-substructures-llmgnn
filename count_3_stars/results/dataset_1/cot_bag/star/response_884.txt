Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6}.

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 6>
<1, 5, 6>
<2, 6, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
