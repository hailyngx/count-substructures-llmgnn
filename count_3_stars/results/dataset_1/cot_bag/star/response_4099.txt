Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 6 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 42 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:

<2, (1, 0, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 3, 7)>
