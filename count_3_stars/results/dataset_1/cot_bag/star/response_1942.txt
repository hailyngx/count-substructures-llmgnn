Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   0
  / \
 2 - 1 - 7 - 4
     |   |   |
     8 - 6 - 5
     |
     3
```

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7).
  - It can form 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 1, 7)>.
  - It can form 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 0, 7)>.
  - It can form 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (2, 0, 1)>.
  - Total 3-stars: 3

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 2).
  - It can form 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (7, 4, 6)>.
  - It can form 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (7, 1, 6)>.
  - It can form 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (7, 1, 4)>.
  - Total 3-stars: 3

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3 + 3] = 6. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 1, 7)>, <1, (2, 0, 7)>, <7, (2, 0, 1)>, <1, (7, 4, 6)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, and <6, (7, 1, 4)>.
