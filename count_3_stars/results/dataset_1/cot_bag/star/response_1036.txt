Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4

Let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, 9. <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 6, 8. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 4, 6. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 4, 9. <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 3, 8. <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 7, 8. <6, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [6] unique 3-stars in this graph.
