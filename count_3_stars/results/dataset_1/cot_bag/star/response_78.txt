Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are given below:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars with each node:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <0, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <0, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <0, (7, 1, 5)>
  - <0, (7, 1, 6)>

- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <3, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <7, (0, 1, 5)>
  - <7, (0, 1, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 0)>
  - <7, (6, 4, 3)>

- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  - <9, (0, 5, 8)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [13].
