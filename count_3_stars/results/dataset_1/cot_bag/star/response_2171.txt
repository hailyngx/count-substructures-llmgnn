Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with only 2 neighbors: 2, 4, 9.
Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

The remaining nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 1: [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars
Node 3: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
Node 5: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

By summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [1 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 24.

So, there are 24 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
