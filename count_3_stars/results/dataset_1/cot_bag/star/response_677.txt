Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph described:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 2, 6, 9
- 1 is connected to 4, 8
- 2 is connected to 0, 3
- 3 is connected to 2
- 4 is connected to 1, 8
- 5 is connected to 8, 9
- 6 is connected to 0, 9
- 8 is connected to 1, 4, 5
- 9 is connected to 0, 5, 6

Let's determine the number of 3-star graphs in this network:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 5)>
