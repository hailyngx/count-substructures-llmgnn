Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 each have at least three neighbors.  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes:

\(10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 68\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 68. 

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (0, 6, 8)>  
<3, (1, 6, 8)>  
<4, (3, 6, 8)>  
<5, (1, 7, 9)>  
<6, (1, 3, 4)>  
<8, (1, 4, 6)>  
<9, (1, 5, 7)>  

Putting this final number inside brackets, we have [68].
