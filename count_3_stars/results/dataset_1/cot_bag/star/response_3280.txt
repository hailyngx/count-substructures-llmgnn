Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we have a total of 20 3-stars, which can be represented as:

\[ [20] \]

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

\[ <0, 2, 6> \]
\[ <1, 2, 5> \]
\[ <1, 2, 9> \]
\[ <1, 5, 9> \]
\[ <2, 0, 6> \]
\[ <2, 1, 6> \]
\[ <2, 6, 4> \]
\[ <5, 1, 9> \]
\[ <5, 3, 8> \]
\[ <5, 9, 1> \]
\[ <6, 0, 2> \]
\[ <6, 2, 3> \]
\[ <6, 2, 4> \]
\[ <6, 2, 7> \]
\[ <6, 3, 5> \]
\[ <6, 4, 7> \]
\[ <6, 7, 4> \]
\[ <6, 7, 4> \]
\[ <6, 7, 4> \]
\[ <6, 7, 4> \]
