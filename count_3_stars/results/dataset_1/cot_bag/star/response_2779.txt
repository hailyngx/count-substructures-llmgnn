Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 8), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 8)}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 4, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
