Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [54].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
