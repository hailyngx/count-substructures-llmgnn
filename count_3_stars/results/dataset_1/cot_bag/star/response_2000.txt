Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9 has a neighbor: 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 6: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
