Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}. 

Let's now find the central nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 4 + 10 = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 2, 0)>
<5, (4, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 2, 4)>

Thus, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in this graph.
