Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 8}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars with each node:
- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
