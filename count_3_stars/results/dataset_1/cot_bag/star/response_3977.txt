Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Nodes 3 and 5 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around them. 

For node 3: There are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 3.

For node 5: There are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4] = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 6)>
- <3, (5, 8, 7)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 8, 7)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 7)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 7)>
- <5, (7, 8, 3)>
- <5, (7, 8, 3)>
- <5, (8, 3, 7)>
- <5, (8, 3, 9)>
- <5, (8, 7, 3)>
- <5, (8, 3, 7)>
- <5, (8, 3, 9)>
- <5, (8, 7, 3)>
- <5, (8, 3, 7)>
