Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
      The edges are: 
      (0, 3), (0, 6),
      (1, 2), (1, 7),
      (2, 1), (2, 9),
      (3, 0),
      (4, 8), (4, 9),
      (5, 8),
      (6, 0),
      (7, 1),
      (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 9),
      (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8).

      Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
      Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
      Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
      Node 3 has 1 neighbor. Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
      Node 4 has 3 neighbors. It forms 1 3-star.
      Node 5 has 1 neighbor. Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
      Node 6 has 1 neighbor. Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
      Node 7 has 1 neighbor. Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
      Node 8 has 4 neighbors. It forms 1 3-star.
      Node 9 has 4 neighbors. It forms 3 3-stars.

      Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 3] = [5]

      Unique 3-stars found:
      <4, (8, 9, 5)>
      <8, (4, 9, 5)>
      <9, (2, 8, 4)>
      <9, (4, 8, 8)>
      <9, (8, 2, 8)>
