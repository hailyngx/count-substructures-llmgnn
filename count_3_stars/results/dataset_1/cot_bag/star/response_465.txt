Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph, and we need to identify the 3-stars within this graph. 

Looking at the nodes and their neighbors, we find the following information:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star
- Node 1 can form 10 3-stars
- Node 2 can form 10 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form 10 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 10 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 9 cannot form any 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <1, 0, 2>
- <1, 2, 0>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 9>
- <2, 0, 1>
- <2, 1, 0>
- <2, 1, 6>
- <2, 1, 9>
- <3, 1, 0>
- <3, 1, 6>
- <3, 1, 8>
- <3, 1, 9>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <4, 3, 1>
- <4, 7, 3>
- <5, 2, 7>
- <5, 3, 4>
- <6, 0, 1>
- <6, 1, 0>
- <6, 1, 2>
- <6, 1, 7>
- <6, 1, 8>
- <7, 2, 1>
- <7, 3, 4>
- <7, 6, 1>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <7, 8, 1>

- <8, 1, 6>
- <8, 1, 7>
- <8, 4, 3>
- <8, 6, 1>
- <8, 7, 3>
- <9, 1, 2>
- <9, 2, 1>
