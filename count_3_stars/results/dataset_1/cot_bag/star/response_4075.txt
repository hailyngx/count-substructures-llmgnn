Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {2, 7, 8, 4}
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 4}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {7, 8, 9}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 20 + 1] = [25] \).

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
