Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first construct the graph and then identify the 3-stars based on the criteria provided.

The graph:
- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.

Now, let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars they are part of:

- **Node 2:** This node has 5 neighbors. So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 9)>

- **Node 6:** This node also has 4 neighbors. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
    - <6, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <6, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is $10 + 4 = 14$. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
