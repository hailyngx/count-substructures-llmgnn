Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 1)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 6)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up gives us a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
