Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
For Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
For Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, there are 32 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
