Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7. Hence, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (3, 5, 7)>.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9. Hence, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2: [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
