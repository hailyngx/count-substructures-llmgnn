Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
   0 --- 2 --- 4
   |     |     |
   5     5     7
   |     |   / |
   6     0 /   3
               |
               1 --- 8
               |  
               9
```

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6): [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5): [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7): [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4): [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9): [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 3 and Node 7 have 2 neighbors each, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Nodes 6 and 8 have only 1 neighbor each, so they do not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has no neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
