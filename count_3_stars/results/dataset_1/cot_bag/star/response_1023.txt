Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with the number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 56

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

Unique 3-stars:

- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (4, 9, 6)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (8, 9, 6)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
