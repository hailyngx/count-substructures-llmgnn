Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by visually representing the graph:

```
    0 ---- 1 ---- 3 ---- 9 ---- 2
    |           |     |      |
    4           7     5      |
    |                     \   |
    8                       9
```

Now let's analyze each node to see which ones can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 9, 9)> (Note: Two connections to node 9)
- Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 9, 9)>
