Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's arrange the nodes and their connections in a more organized manner:

1: 2, 7
2: 1, 6
3: 8
4: 5, 9
5: 4, 9
6: 2
7: 1
8: 3, 9
9: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 8)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (4, 9, 8)>
Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 9, 4)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <5, (4, 9, 8)>, <8, (3, 9, 4)>, and <9, (4, 5, 8)>.
