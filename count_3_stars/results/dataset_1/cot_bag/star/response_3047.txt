Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 3, 5, and 7, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has neighbors 6 and 8, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbors 4, 8, and 9, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 4, and 6, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all the nodes, we get 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
