Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \([\binom{3}{3}] = 1\)
- Node 1: \([\binom{3}{3}] = 1\)
- Node 2: \([\binom{4}{3}] = 4\)
- Node 3: \([\binom{4}{3}] = 4\)
- Node 4: \([\binom{5}{3}] = 10\)
- Node 5: \([\binom{6}{3}] = 20\)
- Node 6: \([\binom{5}{3}] = 10\)
- Node 8: \([\binom{5}{3}] = 10\)

Summing these up: \([1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10] = 60\)

There are 60 total 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 6, 8>
