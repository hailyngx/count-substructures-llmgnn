Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and the specified edges:

                             0
                             |
                             1
                           / | \
                          2  3  4
                         /| /| /|\
                        5 6 5 6 7 9
                           | | |
                           8 3 4

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the method mentioned earlier:

For node 1, there are 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3), so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
For node 2, there are 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 3, there are 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
For node 4, there are 5 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 7, 9), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 2 neighbors (2, 3), so it can't form any 3-star.
For node 6, there are 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 7, 8), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 7, there are 2 neighbors (4, 6), so it can't form any 3-star.
For node 8, there is 1 neighbor (6), so it can't form any 3-star.
For node 9, there is 1 neighbor (4), so it can't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29, which you should put inside brackets [].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
< 1, (0, 2, 3) >
< 2, (1, 4, 5) >
< 2, (1, 4, 6) >
< 2, (1, 5, 6) >
< 2, (4, 5, 6) >
< 3, (1, 4, 5) >
< 3, (1, 4, 6) >
< 3, (1, 5, 6) >
< 3, (4, 5, 6) >
< 4, (2, 3, 6) >
< 4, (2, 4, 6) >
< 4, (2, 6, 7) >
< 4, (2, 6, 9) >
< 4, (3, 4, 6) >
< 4, (3, 6, 7) >
< 4, (3, 6, 9) >
< 4, (4, 6, 7) >

< 6, (3, 6, 9) >
< 6, (4, 6, 7) >
< 6, (4, 6, 9) >
