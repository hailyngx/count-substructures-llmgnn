Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: Only 1 3-star
- Node 9: Only 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 22 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

Let's list them now:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
