Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (less than 3).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding the 3-stars formed by nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9:
1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [56].

List of unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
