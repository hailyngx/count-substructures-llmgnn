Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 4), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 6), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 7), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 8, 9), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 9), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7), so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 9) = 20

Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in this graph. The final answer to be put inside brackets is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
