Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph with its nodes and edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 3), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 2), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

1. Node 2: It has neighbors 7, 9. So, we have 1 3-star.
2. Node 3: It has neighbors 4, 6. So, we have 1 3-star.
3. Node 4: It has neighbor 3. So, no 3-star.
4. Node 6: It has neighbors 3, 9. So, we have 1 3-star.
5. Node 7: It has neighbor 2. So, no 3-star.
6. Node 8: It has neighbor 9. So, no 3-star.
7. Node 9: It has neighbors 2, 6, 8. So, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, the final result is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (7, 9)>, <3, (4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>.
