Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 4, and 7. Thus, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (6, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
