Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3}\) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing these up, we get a total of \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 54 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
