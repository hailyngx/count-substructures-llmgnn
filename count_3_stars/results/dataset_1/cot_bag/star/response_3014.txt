Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 3, 5
Node 2: 3, 8
Node 3: 1, 2, 8
Node 4: 6
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 4
Node 8: 2, 3, 9
Node 9: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 1: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 3: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1

So, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
