Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {9}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {}

Identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors, we have nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 6, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
