Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first represent the edges in the graph using the provided information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 3)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node, we will check if it has at least 3 neighbors (degree >= 3). Nodes 0, 5, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors so they can't form 3-stars. Nodes 1, 2, and 4 have 3 neighbors each, so they can each form 1 3-star. Nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8 have more than 3 neighbors.

For these nodes:
Node 3: There are 3 possible 3-stars: <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>
Node 6: There are 3 possible 3-stars: <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>
Node 7: There are 2 possible 3-stars: <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>
Node 8: There are 2 possible 3-stars: <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 3)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars:
1 (Node 1) + 1 (Node 2) + 1 (Node 4) + 3 (Node 3) + 3 (Node 6) + 2 (Node 7) + 2 (Node 8) = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (4, 1, 0)>
<4, (1, 2, 0)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 3)>
