Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 6 -> [1]
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 8 -> [1]
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 6 -> [1]
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 8 -> [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [4].
