Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 9, 5)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>.
