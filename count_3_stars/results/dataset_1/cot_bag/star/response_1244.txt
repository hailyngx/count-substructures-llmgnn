Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 8 3-stars. So the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars formed by the given graph are:

- <0, 1, 2, 4>
- <1, 0, 6, 8>
- <6, 1, 8, 9>
- <7, 3, 4, 5>
- <7, 4, 5, 9>
- <7, 5, 6, 8>
- <7, 6, 8, 9>
- <8, 1, 5, 6>
