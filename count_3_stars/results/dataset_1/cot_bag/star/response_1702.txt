Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the adjacency list for the given graph:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form C(6, 3) = 20 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form C(6, 3) = 20 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 70

Therefore, the answer is [70].
