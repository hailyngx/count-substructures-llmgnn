Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 1
- 1 is connected to 0, 3, 4
- 2 is connected to 3, 9
- 3 is connected to 1, 2, 6, 7
- 4 is connected to 1, 8
- 5 is connected to 6, 9
- 6 is connected to 3, 5, 8
- 7 is connected to 3, 9
- 8 is connected to 4, 6, 9
- 9 is connected to 2, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Nodes 1 and 9 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 3-stars.
- Nodes 3, 6, and 8 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 1 + (4 \times 3) = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
