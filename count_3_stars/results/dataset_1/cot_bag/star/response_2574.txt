Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graphs in this network, we look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 19 \).

So, the answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (6, 1, 7)>
- <0, (6, 1, 3)>
- <0, (6, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (5, 3, 1)>
- <5, (2, 3, 1)>
- <6, (1, 0, 3)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (4, 8, 3)>
- <5, (3, 1, 6)>
- <1, (6, 0, 5)>
