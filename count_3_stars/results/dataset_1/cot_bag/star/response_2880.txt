Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<2, (3, 5, 6)> <2, (3, 5, 8)> <2, (3, 6, 8)> <2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)> <2, (3, 6, 9)> <2, (3, 8, 9)> <2, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)> <2, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<3, (2, 5, 8)> <3, (2, 5, 9)> <3, (2, 8, 9)> <3, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<4, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<5, (1, 2, 3)> <5, (1, 2, 4)> <5, (1, 2, 7)> <5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)> <5, (1, 4, 7)> <5, (2, 3, 4)> <5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)> <5, (3, 4, 7)> <5, (1, 2, 6)> <5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)> <5, (2, 3, 6)> <5, (2, 4, 6)> <5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)> <5, (2, 6, 7)> <5, (3, 6, 7)> <5, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<6, (0, 7, 2)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (0, 1, 5)> <7, (0, 5, 6)> <7, (1, 5, 6)> <7, (0, 5, 2)>

For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Adding up all the 3-stars:
10 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 20 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42].
