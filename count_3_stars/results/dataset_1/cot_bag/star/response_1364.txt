Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are three nodes with 4 or more neighbors: node 3, node 4, and node 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from nodes 3, 4, and 5, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].
