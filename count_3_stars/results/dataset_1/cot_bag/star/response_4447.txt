Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16, which we will denote as [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 6, 3)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 0, 5)>
- <8, (6, 3, 5)>
- <8, (6, 5, 0)>
- <8, (6, 5, 3)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 2, 0)>
- <6, (5, 2, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 2)>
- <6, (7, 2, 9)>
- <6, (7, 5, 2)>
