Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6) 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 9)
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6)
  
Calculating the number of 3-stars around each eligible node:

Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:  
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (5, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
