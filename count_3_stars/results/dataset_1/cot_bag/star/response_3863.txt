Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes connected to each node are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 8
- Node 7 is connected to node 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 8

We notice that nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can start by calculating the 3-stars formed with these nodes. 

For node 0:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

For node 1:
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

For node 2:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

For node 8:
- inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [38] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>

- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (8, 9, 0)>
- <2, (8, 9, 3)>
- <2, (8, 9, 5)>
- <8, (0, 9, 1)>
- <8, (0, 9, 6)>
