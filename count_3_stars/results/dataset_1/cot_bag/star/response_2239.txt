Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph:

```
    0 --- 3 --- 7 --- 6
   /       |   /     / 
  1 ---- 2 |  9    8
   \       |  /
    4 --- 5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6) - 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7) - 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 9) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9) - 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7) - 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
