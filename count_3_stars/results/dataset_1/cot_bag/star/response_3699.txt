Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's determine the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph:

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6) -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (6, 8) -> No 3-star
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7) -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (0, 9) -> No 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9) -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (0, 2) -> No 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 8) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (2, 6) -> No 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6) -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6) -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (node 0) + 1 (node 2) + 1 (node 4) + 4 (node 6) + 1 (node 8) + 1 (node 9) = 9

There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (8, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
