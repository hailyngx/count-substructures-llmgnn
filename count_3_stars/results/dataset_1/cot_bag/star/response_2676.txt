Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars:

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12] with the unique 3-stars:
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>
