Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
       0----2
      / \  / \
     8   1----6
         |    |
         4----8
         |    |
         5    9
        / \
       3   7
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <5, (2, 4, 6)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8: <6, (1, 2, 8)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 1: <7, (5, 9, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
