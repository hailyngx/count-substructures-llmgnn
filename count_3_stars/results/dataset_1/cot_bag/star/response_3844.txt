Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 8, 9).
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 4, 9, 0).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 7).
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 7).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 9).
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor (node 4).
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 8, 9).
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 7).
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 0).

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28.

So, there are 28 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets gives us [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 2)>
