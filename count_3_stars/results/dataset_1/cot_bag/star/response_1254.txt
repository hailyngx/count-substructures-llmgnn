Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges based on the given information:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 9.
Node 4 is connected to node 2.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 9.
Node 7 is connected to node 8.
Node 8 is connected to node 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 doesn't form a 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 6)>.
- Node 3 doesn't form a 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 doesn't form a 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 doesn't form a 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 9, 0)>.
- Nodes 7 and 8 do not form any 3-star since they are isolated.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 6)>.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]  
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 9, 0)>
