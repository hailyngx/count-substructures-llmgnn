Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<3, (7, 1, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 4)>
<3, (7, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 2, 1)>
<3, (7, 2, 4)>
<3, (7, 2, 5)>
<3, (7, 4, 1)>
<3, (7, 4, 2)>
<3, (7, 4, 5)>
<3, (7, 5, 1)>
<3, (7, 5, 2)>
<3, (7, 5, 4)>
