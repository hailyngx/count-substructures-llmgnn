Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (since it has 5 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) (since it has 6 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (since it has 4 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (since it has 4 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
