Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6

Looking at the nodes, we see that nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9 have at least 3 neighbors. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44 \) 3-stars. 

So, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
