Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph are nodes 1, 6, and 7. 

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 7, 9).
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars that can be formed with node 1. 

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9).
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars that can be formed with node 6. 

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 9).
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars that can be formed with node 7. 

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 20 + 4 = 34 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
