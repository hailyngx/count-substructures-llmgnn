Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 1)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <8, (0, 3, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.
