Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- For node 1: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- For node 3: There are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- For node 6: There are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- For node 8: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
So the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4] = 39.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
