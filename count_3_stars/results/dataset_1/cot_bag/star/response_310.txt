Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's check the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 3 neighbors  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors  

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (5, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <8, (0, 6, 9)>
