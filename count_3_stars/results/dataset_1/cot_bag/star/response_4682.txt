Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:  

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}  
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 3)

Next, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors for 3-star analysis:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 17

So, the final count of 3-stars is [17].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (8, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
