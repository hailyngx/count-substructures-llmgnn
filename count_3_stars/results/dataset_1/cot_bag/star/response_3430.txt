Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, and 9): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 3 neighbors (2, 6, and 8): \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)> 
<1, (0, 2, 5)> 
<2, (0, 1, 8)> 
<6, (0, 8, 9)> 
<7, (0, 4, 5)> 
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
