Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbor {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 9: It has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (6, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 2)>
<9, (1, 8, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>
