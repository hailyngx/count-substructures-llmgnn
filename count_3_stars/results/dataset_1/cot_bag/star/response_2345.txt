Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first construct the graph and identify the nodes and their connections based on the provided edges.

The graph consists of 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and 28 edges as listed.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {5, 7, 9} - Possible 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   <0, (5, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1 has neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6} - Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
   <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   <1, (2, 3, 6)>
   <1, (2, 4, 6)>
   <1, (3, 4, 6)>

3. Node 2 has neighbors {1, 5} - Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

4. Node 3 has neighbors {1, 7, 9} - Possible 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   <3, (1, 7, 9)>

5. Node 4 has neighbors {1, 9} - Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

6. Node 5 has neighbors {0, 2, 7, 9} - Possible 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
   <5, (0, 2, 7)>
   <5, (0, 2, 9)>
   <5, (0, 7, 9)>
   <5, (2, 7, 9)>

7. Node 6 has neighbors {1, 9} - Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

8. Node 7 has neighbors {0, 3, 5} - Possible 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   <7, (0, 3, 5)>

9. Node 8 has no neighbors - Not enough neighbors for a 3-star

10. Node 9 has neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6} - Possible 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   <9, (0, 3, 4)>
   <9, (0, 3, 5)>
   <9, (0, 3, 6)>
   <9, (0, 4, 5)>
   <9, (0, 4, 6)>
   <9, (0, 5, 6)>
   <9, (3, 4, 5)>
   <9, (3, 4, 6)>
   <9, (3, 5, 6)>
   <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Adding up all the 3-stars we found, we get a total of [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = 21 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges is [21].
