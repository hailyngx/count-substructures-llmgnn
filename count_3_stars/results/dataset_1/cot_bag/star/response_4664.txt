Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars.
Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the combinations, the total number of 3-stars is: [1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
1. <0, (5, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 5, 7)>
5. <3, (2, 6, 7)>
6. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
7. <3, (5, 7, 4)>
8. <5, (0, 1, 3)>
9. <5, (0, 3, 4)>
10. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
11. <5, (3, 4, 7)>
12. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
13. <7, (3, 4, 8)>
14. <7, (4, 8, 7)>
15. (3, 5, 7)
