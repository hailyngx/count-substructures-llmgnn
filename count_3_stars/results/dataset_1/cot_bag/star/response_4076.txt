Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are as follows:  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8  
- Node 2 is connected to node 0  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9  
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8  

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph and count them.  
For each node, we check if it has three or more neighbors to form a 3-star.  

Calculations:  
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6.  
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9.  
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 1.  

Total 3-stars: [3]  
Unique 3-stars:  
<1, (3, 5, 6)>  
<4, (7, 8, 9)>  
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
