Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 9), (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors so that we can calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20

So, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, and <0, (5, 8, 9)>.
