Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's describe the graph using the provided nodes and edges to visualize it better:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 1: 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 2: 2 neighbors (1, 4)
Node 5: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 8)>

Node 6: 2 neighbors (1, 5)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 9)
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Node 9: 2 neighbors (0, 8)

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6 (4 from node 1 and 1 each from nodes 5 and 8), so the total number of 3-stars is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, and <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
