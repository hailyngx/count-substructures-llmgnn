Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors and sum them up:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
