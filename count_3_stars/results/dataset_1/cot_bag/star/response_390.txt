Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed using those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9), (4, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)
- Node 5: (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (7, 5)
- Node 6: (3, 6), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 9), (8, 6), (9, 6)
- Node 8: (0, 8), (1, 8), (6, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8)
- Node 9: (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{12}{3} = 220 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 35 + 10 + 20 + 56 + 220 = 341 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 341.

So the final answer, represented inside brackets, is [341].

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (8, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
