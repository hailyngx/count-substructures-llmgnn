Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find nodes with three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2: C(2, 3) = 0
- For node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- For node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- For node 6: C(3, 3) = 1
- For node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
- For node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
- For node 9: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 24

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

List of unique 3-stars:
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>
