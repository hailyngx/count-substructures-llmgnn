Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
