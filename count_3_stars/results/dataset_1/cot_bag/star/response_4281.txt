Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: Since Node 9 has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12.
List of unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)> 

Therefore, the answer is [12].
