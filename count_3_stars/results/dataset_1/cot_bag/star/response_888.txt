Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
- For node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- For node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10  
- For node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20  
- For node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10  
- For node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10  
- For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 55.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>  
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>  
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>  
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>  
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>  
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
