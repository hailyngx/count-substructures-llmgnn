Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to see if they can form a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19\).

Therefore, the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 4)>, <2, (4, 3, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 3)>, <2, (5, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 4, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 2)>, <3, (2, 1, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 1)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 2, 1)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 2)>, <3, (2, 1, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 1)>, <3, (8, 1, 2)>, <3, (8, 2, 1)>
