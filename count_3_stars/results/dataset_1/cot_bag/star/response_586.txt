Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented with the following nodes and edges:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7}

Let's now identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, 1, 3>
2. Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, 0, 5>
3. Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, 1, 2> and <5, 8, 1>
4. Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, 3, 0> and <8, 5, 7>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 1 + 2 + 2] = 6.
Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph are: <0, 1, 3>, <1, 0, 5>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 8, 1>, <8, 3, 0>, and <8, 5, 7>.
