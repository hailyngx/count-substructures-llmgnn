Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, forms one 3-star)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

So, the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 4)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 7)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 1, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 4)>.
