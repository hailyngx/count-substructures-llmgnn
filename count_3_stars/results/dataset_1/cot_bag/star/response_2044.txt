Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9 do not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10] = 14 \). 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<0, (7, 2, 9)>
