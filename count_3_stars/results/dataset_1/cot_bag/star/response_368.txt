Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form. 

Looking at the degrees of the nodes:
- Node 0 has degree 6.
- Node 1 has degree 4.
- Node 2 has degree 5.
- Node 3 has degree 2.
- Node 4 has degree 5.
- Node 5 has degree 4.
- Node 6 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 4.
- Node 9 has degree 3.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
