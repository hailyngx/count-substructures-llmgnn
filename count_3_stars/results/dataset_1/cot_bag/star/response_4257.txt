Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the nodes and edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Now, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23 3-stars. So, the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 9, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
