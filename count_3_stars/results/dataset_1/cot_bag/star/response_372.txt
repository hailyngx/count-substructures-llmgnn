Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 0), (4, 6), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 2), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: Has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 9) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6) => 1 3-star
- Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7) => 1 3-star
- Node 6: Has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 0) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: Has 2 neighbors (0, 8) => No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 6) = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 0)>, <6, (2, 4, 0)>, <6, (2, 4, 1)>, <6, (0, 4, 1)>, <6, (1, 4, 0)>, <6, (2, 4, 1)>, <6, (2, 1, 4)>
