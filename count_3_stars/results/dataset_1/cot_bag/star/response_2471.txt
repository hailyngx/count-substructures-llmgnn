Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 42 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (6, 9, 2)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
