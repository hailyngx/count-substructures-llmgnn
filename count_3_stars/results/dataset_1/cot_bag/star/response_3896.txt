Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3)
- Node 2: 7 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (2, 6)

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 35 + 4 + 10 = 50 3-stars.
So, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
