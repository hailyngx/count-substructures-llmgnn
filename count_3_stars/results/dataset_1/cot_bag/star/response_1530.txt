Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 1 + 4 = 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>.
