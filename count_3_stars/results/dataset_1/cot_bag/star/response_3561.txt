Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
Graph:

   0 -- 6 -- 9 -- 5 -- 1
   |    |    |    |
   7    2    3    8
            |
            4
```

The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there are $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there are $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 23$.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 5, 9)>, <6, (9, 5, 1)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].
