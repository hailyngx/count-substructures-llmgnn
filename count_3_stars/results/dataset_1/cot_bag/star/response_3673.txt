Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1

Let's identify the central nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <6, (1, 5, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.
