Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6
Node 1 neighbors: 4
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 6
Node 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 7 neighbors: 9
Node 8 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 7, 8

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [20] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
