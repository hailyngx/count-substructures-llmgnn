Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors for better visualization:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3 
- Node 3: 2 
- Node 4: 0, 9 
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 8 
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: 1 3-star formed
- Node 1: 3 3-stars formed
- Node 4: 1 3-star formed
- Node 6: 1 3-star formed
- Node 9: 3 3-stars formed

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 9

So, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 9)>,
<1, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 6, 5)>, 
<1, (4, 9, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 9, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<9, (4, 1, 5)>.
