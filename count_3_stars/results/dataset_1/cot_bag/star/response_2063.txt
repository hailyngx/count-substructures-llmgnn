Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8.

Now, let's go through each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: Combination of 3-stars: [2]  
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: No 3-star formed
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star formed
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: No 3-star formed
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star formed
- Node 9: No 3-star formed

So the total number of 3-stars is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>
