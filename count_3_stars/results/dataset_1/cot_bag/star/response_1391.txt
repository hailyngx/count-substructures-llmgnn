Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: There are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 3 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41 \)

So, there are a total of 41 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is \[ 41 \] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
