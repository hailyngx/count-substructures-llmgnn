Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 8
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0, 2
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 8, 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up, we get a total of 5 3-stars: [5]
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>
