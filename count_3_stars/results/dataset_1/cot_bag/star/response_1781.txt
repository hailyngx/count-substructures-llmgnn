Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 5)
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6)
(2, 9)
(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7)
(4, 3), (4, 9)
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6)
(6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 9)
(7, 3)
(8, 9)
(9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed at each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

[List the unique 3-stars found]:
[5]

<1, 3, 7>
<3, 1, 5>
<5, 0, 6>
<6, 1, 9>
<9, 2, 8>
