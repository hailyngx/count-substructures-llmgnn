Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 2, 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>
