Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

```
    0 -- 5          4 -- 7
    |    |          |    |
    8    1 -- 3 -- 9    6
            |    |
            2    |
                 8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

We will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each node
- Summing up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
