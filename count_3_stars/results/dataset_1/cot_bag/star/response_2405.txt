Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \(10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is \([54]\).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
