Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 8

We see that nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    <1, (2, 8, 9)>
    <1, (3, 8, 9)>
    <1, (2, 3, 8)>
    <1, (2, 3, 9)>

For node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    <3, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    <8, (0, 1, 9)>
    <8, (1, 7, 9)>
    <8, (0, 1, 7)>
    <8, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    <9, (1, 3, 6)>
    <9, (1, 8, 6)>
    <9, (3, 8, 6)>
    <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
