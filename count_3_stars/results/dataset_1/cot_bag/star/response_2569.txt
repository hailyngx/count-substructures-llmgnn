Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 8
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, we can identify the nodes that can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 5, 6, and 9 have degrees 4 or more.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 56 + 4 + 20 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 84 and can be represented as: [84].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, and <9, (0, 5, 7)>.
