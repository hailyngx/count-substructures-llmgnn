Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}. Let's analyze each node to find the total number of 3-stars.

Node 0: It has 2 neighbors: {5, 6}. No 3-star is formed here.

Node 1: It has 2 neighbors: {4, 6}. No 3-star is formed here.

Node 2: It has 1 neighbor: {4}. No 3-star is formed here.

Node 3: It has 1 neighbor: {6}. No 3-star is formed here.

Node 4: It has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}. There are inom{5}{3} = 10 ways to form 3-stars here.
Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>.

Node 5: It has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 8}. There is 1 way to form a 3-star here.
Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 8)>.
  
Node 6: It has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. There are inom{5}{3} = 10 ways to form 3-stars here.
Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>.

Node 8: It has 2 neighbors: {4, 5}. No 3-star is formed here.

Node 9: It has 1 neighbor: {8}. No 3-star is formed here.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 10] = 21. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>.
