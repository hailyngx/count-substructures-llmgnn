Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
```
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 8), (8, 0), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 4)
```

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we have \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 35] = 44 \) 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 0, 3)>
- <5, (2, 0, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (3, 0, 4)>
- <5, (3, 1, 4)>
- <5, (4, 0, 6)>
- <5, (4, 1, 3)>
- <5, (4, 1, 6)>
- <5, (6, 0, 4)>
- <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- <5, (6, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
