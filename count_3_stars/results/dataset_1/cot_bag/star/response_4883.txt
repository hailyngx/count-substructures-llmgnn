Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will examine each node and check for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node based on the mentioned combinatorial calculation.

Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 6).
  Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: [1]
  <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (3, 6, 8, 9).
  Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: [4]
  <5, (3, 8, 9)>
  <5, (6, 8, 9)>
  <5, (3, 6, 9)>
  <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (2, 4, 5).
  Number of 3-stars with Node 6 as the center: [3]
  <6, (2, 4, 5)>
  <6, (4, 5, 8)>
  <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (1, 8, 9).
  Number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: [3]
  <7, (1, 8, 9)>
  <7, (8, 9, 5)>
  <7, (1, 9, 5)>
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: (0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9).
  Number of 3-stars with Node 8 as the center: [6]
  <8, (0, 3, 4)>
  <8, (0, 4, 9)>
  <8, (0, 3, 9)>
  <8, (3, 5, 9)>
  <8, (4, 7, 9)>
  <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (0, 2, 5, 7, 8).
  Number of 3-stars with Node 9 as the center: [5]
  <9, (0, 5, 7)>
  <9, (0, 5, 8)>
  <9, (0, 7, 8)>
  <9, (2, 7, 8)>
  <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 5] = 22.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (1, 9, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
