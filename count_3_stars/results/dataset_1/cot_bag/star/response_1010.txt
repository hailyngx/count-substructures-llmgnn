Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 has neighbors 4 and 8.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2.
- Node 7 has neighbors 1 and 6.
- Node 8 has neighbors 2 and 9.
- Node 9 has neighbors 1 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars

Therefore, we have a total of 1 3-star in this graph, represented as [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <1, (5, 7, 9)>.
