Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's go through each node:

Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
Node 1: 4 neighbors (Nodes 2, 8, 9)
Node 2: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5, 6)
Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 8)
Node 4: 1 neighbor (Node 8)
Node 5: 6 neighbors (Nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 8)
Node 6: 1 neighbor (Node 2)
Node 7: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
Node 8: 5 neighbors (Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5)
Node 9: 1 neighbor (Node 1)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up gives a total of 35 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [35].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>.
