Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
