Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors. <1, (2, 4, 5)> 
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors. <4, (1, 2, 9)> <4, (2, 3, 7)> 
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, and <4, (2, 3, 7)>.
