Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors (6, 7, 8, 9) => [\[ inom{4}{3} = 4 \] total 3-stars]
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7) => [\[ inom{3}{3} = 1 \] total 3-stars]
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9) => [\[ inom{3}{3} = 1 \] total 3-stars]
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 1) => [\[ inom{4}{3} = 4 \] total 3-stars]
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 9) => [\[ inom{4}{3} = 4 \] total 3-stars]
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 8) => [\[ inom{4}{3} = 4 \] total 3-stars]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all nodes with three or more neighbors:
\[ 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18 \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 18.
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 3)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>
