Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
1. Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 9
2. Node 1: 6
3. Node 2: 6, 8
4. Node 3: 6, 8, 9
5. Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7
6. Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
7. Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
8. Node 7: 0, 4, 6
9. Node 8: 2, 3, 5
10. Node 9: 0, 3

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
  
Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
