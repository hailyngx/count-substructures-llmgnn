Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 7)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 7, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 7)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (6, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 35 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>.
