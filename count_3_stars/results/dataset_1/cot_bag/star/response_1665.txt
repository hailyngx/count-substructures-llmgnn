Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, hence we count 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, hence we count 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, hence we count 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, hence we count 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, hence we count 1 3-star.

Putting it all together:
Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 14

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, 
<7, 0, 9>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 1, 8>, <8, 4, 7>, 
<8, 7, 9>, <9, 0, 1> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 14 ([]), and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 2, 9>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 3, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 7, 9>, 
<7, 0, 9>, <7, 1, 3>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 1, 8>, <8, 4, 7>, 
<8, 7, 9>, <9, 0, 1>
