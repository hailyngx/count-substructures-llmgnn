Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first analyze the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 6}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars, we have \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
