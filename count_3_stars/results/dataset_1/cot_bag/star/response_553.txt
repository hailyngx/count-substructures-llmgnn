Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of \( 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
