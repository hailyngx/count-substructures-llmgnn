Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the final answer is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
