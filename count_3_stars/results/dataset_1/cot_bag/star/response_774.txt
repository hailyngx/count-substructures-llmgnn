Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so we can ignore them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 38 \).

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
