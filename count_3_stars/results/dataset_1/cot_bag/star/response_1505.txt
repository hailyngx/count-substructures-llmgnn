Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To visualize and analyze the graph, let's first draw it:

```
         0
        / \
       9 - 5
      /     |
     3 - 1  4 - 8
      \     /
        6
```

For this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

For node 3:
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars formed: <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 0, 9)>, <3, (9, 0, 5)>

For node 4:
- Total number of 3-stars = 1
- Unique 3-star formed: <4, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
- Total number of 3-stars = 1
- Unique 3-star formed: <5, (0, 3, 9)>

For node 9:
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars formed: <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 3)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 0, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 0, 3)>, <9, (5, 0, 9)>, <9, (5, 3, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16]. The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 0, 9)>, <3, (9, 0, 5)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 3)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 0, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 0, 3)>, <9, (5, 0, 9)>, <9, (5, 3, 8)>.
