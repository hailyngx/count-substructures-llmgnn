Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Node 9 has only one neighbor and is excluded from further consideration.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (1, 2, 4) -> 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 5, 7) -> 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 4, 6) -> 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (1, 2, 7) -> 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (0, 2, 5, 7, 8) -> 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 7, 8) -> 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (2, 5, 7) -> 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors: (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9) -> 35 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (4, 5, 7, 9) -> 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each central node, we get: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 1 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
