Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Number of neighbors = 4
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 3, 7
- Number of neighbors = 2
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 0, 9
- Number of neighbors = 2
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 1, 9
- Number of neighbors = 2
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 0, 8
- Number of neighbors = 2
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 7
- Number of neighbors = 1
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 0, 8
- Number of neighbors = 2
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 1, 5
- Number of neighbors = 2
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 4, 6
- Number of neighbors = 2
- Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 3
- Number of neighbors = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 1
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>.
