Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 since node 0 has exactly 2 neighbors.

For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 since node 1 has exactly 3 neighbors.

For node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20 since node 7 has 6 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is 0 + 1 + 20 = 21.

Therefore, the final answer is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (6, 8, 0)>, 
<7, (0, 8, 4)>, 
<7, (6, 0, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 0, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 8, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (4, 8, 6)>, and 
<7, (0, 8, 3)>.
