Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 2, 6, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9} (degree 5)
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8} (degree 5)
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7} (degree 4)
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7} (degree 5)

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes and then sum them up to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \(4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 42 unique 3-stars in the graph:

\[ [42] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
