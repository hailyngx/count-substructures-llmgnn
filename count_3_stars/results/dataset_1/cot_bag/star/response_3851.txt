Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 7), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 5 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>
