Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7) - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 1: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7, 9) - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 3: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6) - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 9) - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 7) - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is: [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [17]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (7, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
