Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can construct the following 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-stars since it only has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1: No 3-stars since it only has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars since it only has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5: No 3-stars since it only has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-stars since it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-stars since it only has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-stars since it only has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
