Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

The central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6.

For node 0:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 13 \) 3-stars in this graph.
