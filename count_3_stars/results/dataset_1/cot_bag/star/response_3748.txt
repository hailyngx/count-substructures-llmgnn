Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 38 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found within the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
