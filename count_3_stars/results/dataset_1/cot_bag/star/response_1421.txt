Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found inside <>: <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>
