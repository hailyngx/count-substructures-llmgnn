Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 5, 6
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 19 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
