Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 7), 
       (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 1), (8, 4), 
       (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6) 

```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars present in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9) -> There are \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8) -> There are \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
Node 2 has 2 neighbors (1, 5) -> No 3-star
Node 3 has 2 neighbors (5, 9) -> No 3-star
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8) -> There are \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
Node 5 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 8, 9) -> There are \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (8, 9) -> No 3-star
Node 7 has 2 neighbors (4, 5) -> No 3-star
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6) -> There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 6) -> There are \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 1, 4>, <1, 0, 8>, <4, 0, 8>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 3, 7>, <5, 3, 8>, 
<5, 3, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <8, 1, 4>, <8, 1, 5>, <8, 1, 6>, <8, 4, 5>, <8, 4, 6>, 
<8, 5, 6>, <9, 0, 3>, <9, 0, 5>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 3, 5>, <9, 3, 6>, <9, 5, 6>.
