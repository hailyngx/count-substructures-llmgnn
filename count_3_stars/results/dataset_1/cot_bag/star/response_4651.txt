Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8)
(1, 6)
(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8)
(3, 0), (3, 8)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6)
(5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7)
(7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 6)
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9)
(9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 27 \).

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 8>

<2, 4, 6>

<2, 7, 5>

<4, 0, 6>

<5, 2, 7>
<6, 0, 4>
