Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

No 3-stars are formed with the other nodes since they have less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
