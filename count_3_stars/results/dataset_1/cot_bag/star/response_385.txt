Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
