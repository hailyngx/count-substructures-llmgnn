Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 3)
```

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors (3-star with center 1: <1, (2, 4, 7)>)
- Node 2: has 4 neighbors (3-star with center 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>)
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors (3-star with center 3: <3, (0, 5, 9)>)
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 2 neighbors

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph: <1, (2, 4, 7)> and <3, (0, 5, 9)>. The total number of 3-stars is [2].
