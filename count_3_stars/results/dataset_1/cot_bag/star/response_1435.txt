Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3, node 6, and node 9.

For node 3, we have the following 3-stars: 
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 6, we have the following 3-stars: 
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 9, we have the following 3-stars: 
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
