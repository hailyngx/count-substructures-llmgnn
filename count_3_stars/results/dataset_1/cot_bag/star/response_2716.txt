Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by listing the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 - has neighbors: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1 - has neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2 - has neighbors: 1, 7, 8
- Node 6 - has neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7 - has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8 - has neighbors: 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars per node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11

So, there are a total of 11 3-stars in this graph: [11].
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
