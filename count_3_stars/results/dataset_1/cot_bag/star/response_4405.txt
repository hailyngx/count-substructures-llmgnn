Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - <1, (3, 4, 6)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 8)>

2. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - <3, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
   - <3, (1, 7, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (1, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (7, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (1, 4, 9)>

3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - <4, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 3, 2)>
   - <4, (1, 3, 2)>
   - <4, (3, 2, 5)>

4. Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)

5. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - <7, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <7, (0, 3, 1)>
   - <7, (0, 9, 1)>
   - <7, (3, 9, 1)>

6. Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up all 3-stars formed, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28 \) 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
