Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [32] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, 1, 5, 9>
- <1, 0, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 0, 9>
- <1, 5, 3, 9>
- <3, 0, 5, 9>
- <3, 5, 0, 9>
- <3, 5, 8, 9>
- <5, 0, 1, 2>
- <5, 0, 1, 3>
- <5, 1, 0, 3>
- <5, 1, 3, 0>
- <5, 2, 9, 0>
- <5, 2, 9, 3>
- <5, 3, 1, 0>
- <5, 3, 1, 9>
- <5, 3, 8, 9>
- <5, 8, 3, 9>
- <9, 0, 1, 5>
- <9, 0, 5, 1>
- <9, 1, 0, 5>
- <9, 1, 5, 0>
- <9, 2, 5, 0>
- <9, 2, 5, 3>
- <9, 3, 1, 5>
- <9, 3, 5, 0>
- <9, 3, 5, 8>
- <9, 5, 0, 1>
- <9, 5, 2, 3>
- <9, 6, 0, 5>
