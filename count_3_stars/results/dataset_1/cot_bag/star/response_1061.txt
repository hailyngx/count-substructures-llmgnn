Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 4 + 84 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 123. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 123, and we represent them as follows:

\[ [123] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (7, 8, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 7)>
6. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
