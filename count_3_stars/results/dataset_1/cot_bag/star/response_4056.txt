Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [10 choose 3] = 120 ways to form 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars.

Thus, there are a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20] = 26 unique 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
