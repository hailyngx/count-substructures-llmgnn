Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes based on their neighbors:

- Node 0: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 \]

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as follows:
\[ [10] \]
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>
