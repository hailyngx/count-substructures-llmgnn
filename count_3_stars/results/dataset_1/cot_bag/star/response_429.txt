Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's represent the connections for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Let's now list the total number of 3-stars and the unique 3-stars formed:

- For node 1: 1 3-star
<1, (3, 5, 6)>

- For node 2: 3 3-stars
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>

- For node 3: 1 3-star
<3, (1, 6, 7)>

Since no other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
