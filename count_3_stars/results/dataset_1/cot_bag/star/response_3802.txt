Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20] = 28, which we will denote as [28].

The unique 3-stars formed in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>
