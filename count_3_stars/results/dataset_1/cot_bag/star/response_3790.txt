Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's begin by visualizing the graph:

```
     0
    /|\
   / | \
  3  6  7
   \ | /
    \|/
     1 - 2
    /|   |\
   / |   | \
  9  5   8  4
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: 5 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 8, 9)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (1, 5) - not enough for a 3-star
Node 3: 2 neighbors (0, 6) - not enough for a 3-star
Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 3)
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: 2 neighbors (0, 2) - not enough for a 3-star
Node 8: 1 neighbor (1) - not enough for a 3-star
Node 9: 2 neighbors (1, 5) - not enough for a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (6, 0, 3)>
