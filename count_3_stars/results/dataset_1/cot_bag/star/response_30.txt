Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Now, let's identify the nodes that are centers of 3-stars:

Node 2: 
- 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>

Node 3: 
- 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 4)>

Node 4: 
- 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 7: 
- 3-stars: <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
