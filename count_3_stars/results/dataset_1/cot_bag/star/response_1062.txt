Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 2, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 1, 8
Node 3: 1, 9
Node 4: 5, 6, 8
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 1, 6
Node 8: 1, 2, 4
Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of [16] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (8, 4, 6)>
<1, (8, 4, 7)>
<1, (8, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 1)>
<8, (1, 7, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 1)>
