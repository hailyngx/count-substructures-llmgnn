Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the provided information:

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (0, 8)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (0, 5, 8)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the final result is [10].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>.
