Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

For Node 5: 
- inom{5}{3} = 10 

For Node 4:
- inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding the 3-stars from Node 5 and Node 4, we get a total of [11]. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<5, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>
