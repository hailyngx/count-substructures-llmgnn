Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph have the following neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7

We can see that nodes 6 and 7 have 5 neighbors each, so we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with each of these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10] = [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
