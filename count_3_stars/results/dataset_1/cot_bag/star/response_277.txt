Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw out the graph based on the given edges:

```
    0 -- 2 -- 6
    |    |    |
    1 -- 3 -- 5
    |    |    
    8 -- 4 -- 9
    |
    7
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: It has 2 neighbors (2 and 6), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 1: It has 3 neighbors (3, 4, and 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 2: It has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 8, and 9), so it can form 10 3-stars.

For node 3: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, and 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.

For node 4: It has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, and 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.

For node 5: It has 2 neighbors (3 and 4), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 6: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, and 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 7: It has 1 neighbor (9), so it can't form any 3-star.

For node 8: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, and 6), so it can form 4 3-stars.

For node 9: It has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, and 7), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30. 

So, the final result is [30], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>.
