Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes have the potential to form 3-stars. 

Based on the provided edge list, the following nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 7, 9}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: No 3-stars are possible as it has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) = 13

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
