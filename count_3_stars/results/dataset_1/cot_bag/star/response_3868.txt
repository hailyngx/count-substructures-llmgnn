Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
As a first step, let's organize the nodes based on the number of neighbors they have:

- Node 0: neighbors - 2, 4, 6 
- Node 1: neighbors - 4, 5, 6 
- Node 2: neighbors - 0, 5 
- Node 3: neighbors - 7, 9 
- Node 4: neighbors - 0, 1, 8 
- Node 5: neighbors - 1, 2, 8 
- Node 6: neighbors - 0, 1 
- Node 7: neighbors - 3 
- Node 8: neighbors - 4, 5 
- Node 9: neighbors - 3

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Thus, there are 4 3-stars in this graph. 
Listing them in <> format, we have: 
<<0, 2, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 5, 6>, <2, 0, 5>, <4, 0, 1, 8>>.
