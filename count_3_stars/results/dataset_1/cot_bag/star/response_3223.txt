Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 has a degree of 3
- Node 1 has a degree of 1
- Node 2 has a degree of 2
- Node 3 has a degree of 4
- Node 4 has a degree of 2
- Node 5 has a degree of 1
- Node 6 has a degree of 2
- Node 7 has a degree of 4
- Node 8 has a degree of 4
- Node 9 has a degree of 0

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 3, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13, so we have [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 0, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 0, 8)>
<7, (8, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
