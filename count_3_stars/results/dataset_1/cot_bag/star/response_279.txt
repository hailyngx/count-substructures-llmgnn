Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, let's construct the graph first:

The graph has 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

The edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.

Now we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0:
- inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

For Node 1:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

For Node 2:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

For Node 3:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

For Node 6:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 17.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (3, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (5, 6)>, <8, (1, 6)>, <8, (2, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
