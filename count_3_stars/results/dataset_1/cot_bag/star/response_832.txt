Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the 3-stars, let's first list the nodes and their corresponding neighbors based on the provided edge list:

Node 0: 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 9
Node 3: 4, 5
Node 4: 0, 3, 8
Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 5
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 0, 4, 9
Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node based on its neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>.
