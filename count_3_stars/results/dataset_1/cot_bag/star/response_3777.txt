Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 0: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- The number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars with node 7: <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>.

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 4 = 57
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [57].
