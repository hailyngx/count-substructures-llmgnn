Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38

So, there are 38 3-stars in total, and these 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
