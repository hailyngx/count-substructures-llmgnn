Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph described, let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 8
Node 1: 9
Node 2: 0
Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 3, 9
Node 7: 3, 8
Node 8: 0, 7
Node 9: 1, 5

We see that nodes 0, 3, and 8 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1+4+0 = 5, which we write as [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
