Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:
```
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7)
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
Nodes with degree 3 or more: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Calculating the 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1 has degree 4, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has degree 4, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has degree 4, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has degree 5, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has degree 4, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has degree 4, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [30]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <1, (7, 4, 9)>
- <1, (8, 6, 2)>
- <1, (9, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 8, 1)>
- <4, (6, 2, 7)>
- <4, (7, 1, 9)>
- <4, (9, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 7, 2)>
- <6, (2, 7, 3)>
- <6, (4, 0, 8)>
- <6, (8, 0, 4)>
- <7, (1, 9, 4)>
- <7, (2, 6, 1)>
- <7, (9, 1, 6)>
- <7, (9, 4, 0)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 9, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (6, 1, 7)>
- <9, (1, 6, 2)>
- <9, (4, 0, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 3)>
- <9, (7, 1, 6)> 
- <9, (7, 4, 0)>
