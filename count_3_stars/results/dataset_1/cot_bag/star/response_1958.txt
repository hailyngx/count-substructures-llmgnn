Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: neighbors {1, 4}, total 2 neighbors
Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 8}, total 3 neighbors
Node 3: neighbors {7, 9}, total 2 neighbors
Node 4: neighbors {0, 1}, total 2 neighbors
Node 7: neighbors {2, 3}, total 2 neighbors
Node 8: neighbors {1, 6}, total 2 neighbors

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 3 and Node 7 do not form any 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.
Node 0 and Node 4 each form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
Node 8 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found in the graph is: <1, (0, 4, 8)>.
