Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node. Nodes with fewer than 3 neighbors cannot form a 3-star, so we will only consider nodes with 3 or more neighbors. 

By examining the neighbors of each node, we find the following 3-stars:
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
