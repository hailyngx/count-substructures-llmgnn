Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 30

So, there are 30 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 3, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 0, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 3)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 9, 2)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
