Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
We can start by listing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 5, 7

Next, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors - nodes 0, 5, and 8.

For node 0, there are ${2 \choose 3} = 0$ 3-stars since it has only 2 neighbors.

For node 5, there are ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star, which is <5, (3, 6, 8)>.

For node 8, there are ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star, which is <8, (0, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0 + 1 + 1] = 2.
