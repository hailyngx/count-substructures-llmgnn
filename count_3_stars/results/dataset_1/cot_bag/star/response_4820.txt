Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: node 0, node 3, and node 6. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 unique 3-stars: 
    - <0, (4, 9)>
 
For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 unique 3-stars: 
    - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <3, (1, 6, 4)>
    - <3, (6, 4, 7)>
 
For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 unique 3-stars: 
    - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 9)>
 
Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
