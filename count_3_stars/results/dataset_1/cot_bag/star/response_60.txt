Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 29

So, the final answer is [29].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 9, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.
