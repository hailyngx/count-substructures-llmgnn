Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph based on the given edges:

```
0 --- 2
 \      \
  \      4 -- 6
   \    /      |
    1       3  9
   /    \      |
  /      7 -- 8
 3 --- 5
```

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
2. Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 6)> <9, (3, 6, 8)>
3. Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
4. Node 1, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8: No 3-stars formed from these nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from Node 4) + 2 (from Node 9) + 1 (from Node 3) = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
