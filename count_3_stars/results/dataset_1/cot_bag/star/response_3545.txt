Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges:

```
        0 --- 2
        |\     \
        | \     \
        |  \     3
        |   \   /|
        |    \ / |
        5-----1--8
              | /
              |/
              4

              6---7
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8. So, it can form 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8. So, it can also form 4 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>.

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8. So, it can form 5 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 5] = [13].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>.
