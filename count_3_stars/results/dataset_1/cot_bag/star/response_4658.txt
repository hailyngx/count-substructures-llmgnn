Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 41

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
