Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
- Node 1: $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
- Node 2: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: $\binom{5}{3}$ = 10
- Node 4: $\binom{3}{3}$ = 1
- Node 5: $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 6: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: $\binom{4}{3}$ = 4
- Node 8: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>
