Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 4 neighbors, which have the potential to form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20. 

So, the final answer is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
