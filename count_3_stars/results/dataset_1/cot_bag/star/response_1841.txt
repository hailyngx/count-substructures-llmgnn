Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (0, 7, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 1, 3)>,
<2, (5, 8, 3)>, <2, (7, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 3)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (2, 8, 7)>, <2, (8, 7, 3)>,
<3, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (8, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 4)>, <3, (4, 2, 5)>,
<5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (5, 8, 9)>,
<7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (2, 8, 3)>, <7, (3, 8, 7)>, <7, (1, 0, 7)>,
<8, (2, 5, 3)>, <8, (2, 8, 7)>.
