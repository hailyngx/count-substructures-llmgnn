Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- For node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 20 = 40 \), so we write this as [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>

So, the final answer is: [40].       
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
