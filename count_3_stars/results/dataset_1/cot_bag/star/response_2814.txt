Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 6, and 9.

For node 0:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 0: <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 6: 
<6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>,
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>

For node 9:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 9:
<9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 4 = 15 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
