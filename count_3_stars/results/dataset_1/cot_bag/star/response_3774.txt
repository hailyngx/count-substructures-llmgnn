Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}.

Node 0 has neighbors: {1, 3, 8}.
Node 1 has neighbors: {0, 7, 8}.
Node 2 has neighbors: {4, 7}.
Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 9}.
Node 4 has neighbors: {2, 3}.
Node 5 has neighbors: {3, 8, 9}.
Node 7 has neighbors: {1, 2}.
Node 8 has neighbors: {0, 1, 5}.
Node 9 has neighbors: {3, 5}.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 1: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 3: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5: There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: $1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7$.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 8, 3)>, 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (8, 3, 9)>, 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 5)>.
