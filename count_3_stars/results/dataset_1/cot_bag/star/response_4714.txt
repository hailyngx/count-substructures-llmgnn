Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Nodes with three neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8  
Nodes with five neighbors: 3, 9  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

For node 1, there are 3 choices for the three other nodes, giving \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 2, there is 1 choice, giving \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, there are 1 choice, giving \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
For node 6, there is 1 choice, giving \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, there is 1 choice, giving \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
For node 3, there are 2 choices for the three other nodes, giving \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since 3 does not form a 3-star).
For node 9, there are 2 choices for the three other nodes, giving \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since 9 does not form a 3-star).

Counting the total number of 3-stars = 1  
Putting the final count in brackets: [1]
