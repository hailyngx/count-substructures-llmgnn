Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Calculating the number of neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 1 neighbor
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 2 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 1:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (5, 7, 8)>

For Node 2:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>

For Node 3:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>

For Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (0, 2, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>

For Node 9:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
