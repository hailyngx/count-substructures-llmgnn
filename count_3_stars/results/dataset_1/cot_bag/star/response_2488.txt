Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 7}

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- For Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
  - <0, (1, 4, 5)>

- For Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <1, (4, 3, 7)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 9)>

- For Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
  - <4, (0, 1, 3)>
  - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <4, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <4, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 2, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <4, (4, 0, 7)>
  - <4, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (5, 0, 7)>
  - <4, (7, 1, 9)>
  - <4, (7, 4, 9)>
  - <4, (7, 5, 9)>
  - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (7, 9, 3)>
  - <4, (7, 9, 4)>
  - <4, (8, 4, 7)>
  - <4, (9, 3, 7)>

- For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
  - <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 20 + 4] = 29. 

Therefore, the answer is [29].
