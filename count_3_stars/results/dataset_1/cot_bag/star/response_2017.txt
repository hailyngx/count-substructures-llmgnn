Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 20] = [35] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <4, (2, 9, 5)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 9, 1)>
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 9, 5)>
- <6, (5, 9, 1)>
- <6, (7, 9, 8)>
- <6, (8, 9, 1)>
- <6, (8, 9, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 8, 5)>
- <9, (4, 8, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
