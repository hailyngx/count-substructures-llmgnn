Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5
- No 3-stars as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 7)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars:  
<3, (0, 1, 2)>  
<3, (0, 1, 5)>  
<3, (0, 2, 5)>  
<3, (1, 2, 5)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 3
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars:  
<5, (1, 4, 8)>  
<5, (1, 3, 4)>  
<5, (1, 3, 8)>  
<5, (3, 4, 8)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 8, 9)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 7)>

Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
