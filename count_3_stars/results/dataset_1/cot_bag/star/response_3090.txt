Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: It has only one neighbor (node 8). No 3-stars are formed.

- Node 1: It has two neighbors (nodes 2 and 3). No 3-stars are formed.

- Node 2: It has four neighbors (nodes 1, 7, 8, 9). There are inom{4}{3} = 4 possible 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>.

- Node 3: It has two neighbors (nodes 1 and 7). No 3-stars are formed.

- Node 4: It has two neighbors (nodes 7 and 9). No 3-stars are formed.

- Node 5: It has one neighbor (node 7). No 3-stars are formed.

- Node 7: It has five neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8). There are inom{5}{3} = 10 possible 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>.

- Node 8: It has three neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 5). There is 1 possible 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 5)>.

- Node 9: It has two neighbors (nodes 2 and 4). No 3-stars are formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10 + 1] = 15. The unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, and <8, (0, 2, 5)>.
