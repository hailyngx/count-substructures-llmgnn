Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 1: 2, 8  
Node 2: 1, 5, 8  
Node 3: 0, 5, 7  
Node 4: 5, 7, 9  
Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8  
Node 6: 0  
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5  
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 5  
Node 9: 4  

Checking each node to see if it forms any 3-star:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
