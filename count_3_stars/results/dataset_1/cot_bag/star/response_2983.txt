Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 6
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 1
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 8
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 3 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 6 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 8 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>.
