Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \).

2. Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8). So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \).

3. Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (6, 7, 8, 9). So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \).

4. Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5). So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( {3 \choose 3} = 1 \).

5. Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 6). So, the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17 \).

Therefore, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
