Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9)
(1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9)
(3, 2), (3, 5)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 8)
(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8)
(7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 9)
(8, 4), (8, 6)
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
Number of 3-stars for each such node:
Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 1: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 6: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 9: C(5, 3) = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)> 
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
