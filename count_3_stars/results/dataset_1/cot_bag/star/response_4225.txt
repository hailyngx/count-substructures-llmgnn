Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0 --- 5 --- 1
    |     |     |
    |     |     |
    5 --- 4 --- 7
    |  /  |  /  |
    | /   | /   |
    1 --- 2 --- 6 --- 9
           |     |
           |     |
           8     3
```

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.
Node 4 has degree 5, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 5 has degree 7, so it can form 35 3-stars.
Node 6 has degree 5, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Summing these, we get $10 + 35 + 10 = 55$ 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [55].
The unique 3-stars are <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
