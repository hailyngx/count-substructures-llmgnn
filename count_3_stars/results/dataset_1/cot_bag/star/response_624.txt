Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

Let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 2, 3)>, and <1, (3, 1, 9)>.
- Node 2 forms <2, (3, 7, 9)>.
- Node 3 forms <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, and <3, (1, 9, 7)>.
- Node 9 forms <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 2)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, and <9, (4, 0, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 2, 3)>, <1, (3, 1, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 9, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 2)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 0, 9)>.
