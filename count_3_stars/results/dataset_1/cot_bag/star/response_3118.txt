Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula provided:

For node 0, it has 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 7).
For node 1, it has 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, and 7).
For node 2, it has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, and 5).
For node 3, it has 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 6).
For node 4, it has 2 neighbors (nodes 1 and 5).
For node 5, it has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6).
For node 6, it has 2 neighbors (nodes 3 and 5).
For node 7, it has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, and 5).

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7.

Putting this final count inside brackets: [7]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>
