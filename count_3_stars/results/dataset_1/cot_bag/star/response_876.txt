Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 choose 3 = 4
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (0, 1, 9)>

Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
<1, (0, 5, 8)>

Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
<5, (1, 2, 3)>

Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
<8, (0, 1, 6)>

Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1
<9, (0, 7, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node:
4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
