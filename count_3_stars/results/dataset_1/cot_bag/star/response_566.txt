Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are six nodes with at least three neighbors in this graph: nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

2. Node 2:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

3. Node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

4. Node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

5. Node 7:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

6. Node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Finally, summing these up:
\[ 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 27 \]

Therefore, there are 27 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
