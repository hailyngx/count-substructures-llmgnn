Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Node 0: 2 neighbors (7, 8)
Node 1: 1 neighbor (3)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (4, 6)
Node 3: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9) --> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 7) --> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 5: 1 neighbor (7)
Node 6: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8) --> inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 8) --> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9) --> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: 2 neighbors (3, 8)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 23.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].
