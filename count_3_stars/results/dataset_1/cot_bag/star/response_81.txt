Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: neighbors 6, 7, 8, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 2: neighbors 3, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 3: neighbors 2, 5 (degree 2)
- Node 4: neighbors 2, 6 (degree 2)
- Node 6: neighbors 1, 4, 8 (degree 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 = 5.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 4)>

So, the final answer is [5].
