Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 55 \)

So, there are a total of 55 3-stars in this graph. Listing them:
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>

So, the final answer is [55].
