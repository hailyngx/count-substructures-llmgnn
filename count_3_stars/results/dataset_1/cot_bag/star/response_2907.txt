Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, we'll focus on nodes with at least three neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8). For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from these nodes: 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 5>
<2, 5, 8>
