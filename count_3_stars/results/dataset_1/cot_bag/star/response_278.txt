Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 30 edges in the graph. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

**Node 0** has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>

**Node 1** has 2 neighbors: 0, 8, so no 3-star can be formed with this node.

**Node 2** has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<2, (5, 8, 9)>

**Node 3** has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<3, (5, 7, 9)>

**Node 4** has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 9, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<4, (0, 8, 9)>

**Node 5** has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<5, (0, 2, 3)>

**Node 7** has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

**Node 8** has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

**Node 9** has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [27].
