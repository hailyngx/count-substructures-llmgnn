Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 4

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
