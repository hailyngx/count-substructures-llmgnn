Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors - nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 3-stars formed with node 1 = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: 3-stars formed with node 2 = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars formed with node 3 = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: 3-stars formed with node 5 = inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
