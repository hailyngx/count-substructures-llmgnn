Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
There are 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 8), so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>


For node 1:
There are 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 6), so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>


For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 9), so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
<2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>


For node 8:
There are 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 9), so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
<8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 22. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
