Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the given edges can be used to construct the graph. 

The degrees of each node in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3

We will focus on nodes 5 and 7 as they have 4 and 5 neighbors respectively. 

For the node 5:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 8. <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 1, 7, and 8. <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 7. <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 4, 7, and 8. <5, (4, 7, 8)>

For the node 7:
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 1, 2, and 5. <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, and 6. <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 1, 6, and 2. <7, (1, 6, 2)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 5, 6, and 2. <7, (5, 6, 2)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, and 2. <7, (1, 5, 2)>

Thus, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<5, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 6, 2)>, 
<7, (5, 6, 2)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 2)>
