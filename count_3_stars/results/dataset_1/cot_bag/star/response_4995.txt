Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center - <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>.

For node 2: 
Since node 2 has 4 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 2 as the center - <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>.

For node 5: 
Since node 5 has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star with node 5 as the center - <5, (1, 6, 9)>.

For node 6: 
Since node 6 has 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars formed with node 6 as the center.

For node 8: 
Since node 8 has 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars formed with node 8 as the center.

For node 9: 
Since node 9 has 4 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center - <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 13 3-stars. 
Thus, the final answer is [13].
