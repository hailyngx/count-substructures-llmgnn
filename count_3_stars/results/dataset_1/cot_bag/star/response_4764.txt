Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 38\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
