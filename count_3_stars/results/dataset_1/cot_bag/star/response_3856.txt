Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 0, 4

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

So, there is only 1 unique 3-star in this graph, which is:
\[ [1, (2, 6, 7)] \]
