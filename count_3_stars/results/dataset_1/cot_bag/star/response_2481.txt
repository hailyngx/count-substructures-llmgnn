Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with it.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, and 9. Therefore, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 4 also has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, and 9. Therefore, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 8. Therefore, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Putting all together: 
\[ [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
