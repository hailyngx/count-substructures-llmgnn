Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
