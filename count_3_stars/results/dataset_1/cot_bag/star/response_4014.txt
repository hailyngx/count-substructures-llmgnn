Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  

Looking at the node degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Starting with the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{6}{3} 3-stars.
- Node 1, 3, 8, and 9 do not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [inom{4}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{6}{3}] = [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20] = [33]

So, there are 33 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 2, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 1)>
<7, (0, 6, 2)>
<7, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 0)>
<7, (2, 6, 3)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 0, 1)>
<7, (5, 0, 6)>
<7, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 0, 2)>
<7, (6, 2, 3)>
<7, (6, 2, 9)>
<7, (6, 3, 2)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
