Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes and their connections can be represented in the following way:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to: 2, 5, 8
- 1 is connected to: 2
- 2 is connected to: 0, 1
- 3 is connected to: 6
- 4 is connected to: 9
- 5 is connected to: 0
- 6 is connected to: 3
- 8 is connected to: 0, 9
- 9 is connected to: 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors {2, 5, 8}
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors {0, 1}
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors {4, 8}

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \sum_{\text{nodes with } \geq 3 \text{ neighbors}} \binom{k}{3} \]

Calculating for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is: <0, (2, 5, 8)>.
