Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 4, 9
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 3, 5
Node 3: 0, 2, 6
Node 4: 0, 8
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 3, 7
Node 7: 1, 6
Node 8: 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>.
