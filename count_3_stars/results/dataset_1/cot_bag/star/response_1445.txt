Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 7 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 15, so the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
