Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node: 
\[ 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16 \]

Therefore, there are 16 3-stars in this graph. Listing them uniquely:
\[ [16] \]
<2, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>
