Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 31 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 9, 3)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 0)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 7)>
- <9, (0, 7, 1)>
- <9, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 6)>
