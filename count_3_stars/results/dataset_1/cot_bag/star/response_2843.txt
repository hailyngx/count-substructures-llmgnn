Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
We start by constructing the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 7), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (9, 6)]

Now we will determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: [(0, 3, 5), (0, 3, 8)]
Node 1: [(1, 4, 6)]
Node 2: [(2, 5, 7)]
Node 3: [(3, 0, 5)]
Node 4: [(4, 1, 7)]
Node 5: [(5, 2, 3), (5, 2, 6), (5, 3, 6)]
Node 6: [(6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 9), (6, 5, 9)]
Node 7: [(7, 2, 4), (7, 4, 8)]
Node 8: [(8, 0, 7)]
Node 9: [(9, 6, 1)]

Total number of 3-stars: 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 7>, <3, 0, 5>, <4, 1, 7>, <5, 2, 3>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 3, 6>, <6, 1, 5>, <6, 1, 9>, <6, 5, 9>
