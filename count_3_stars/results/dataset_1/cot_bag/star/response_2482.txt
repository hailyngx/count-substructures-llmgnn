Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 4, 5
- 1 is connected to 3, 4, 6
- 2 is connected to 4, 8
- 3 is connected to 1, 4, 8
- 4 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- 5 is connected to 0, 4
- 6 is connected to 1, 4, 7
- 7 is connected to 6, 9
- 8 is connected to 2, 3
- 9 is connected to 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (5, 0, 1)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>
<4, (6, 1, 6)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<4, (7, 6, 1)>
<4, (7, 6, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
