Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 9. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars: <0, (4, 5)>, <0, (4, 9)>, <0, (5, 9)>.

Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) 3-stars: <1, (2, 5)>, <1, (2, 6)>, <1, (2, 8)>, <1, (5, 6)>, <1, (5, 8)>, <1, (6, 8)>.

Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars: <2, (1, 4)>, <2, (1, 5)>, <2, (4, 5)>.

Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 9. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars: <3, (4, 6)>, <3, (4, 9)>, <3, (6, 9)>.

Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) 3-stars: <4, (0, 2)>, <4, (0, 3)>, <4, (0, 6)>, <4, (2, 3)>, <4, (2, 6)>, <4, (3, 6)>.

Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \) 3-stars. We won't list them all for brevity.

Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 9. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \) 3-stars. We won't list them all for brevity.

Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 8. It has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 7. It has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6. It can form 3-stars with any combination of two neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) 3-stars. We won't list them all for brevity.

Adding up all the 3-stars listed, we get a total of 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 15 + 10 + 6 = 52 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].
