Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more edges, as these nodes have the potential to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed

Adding these up, we have a total of 13 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
