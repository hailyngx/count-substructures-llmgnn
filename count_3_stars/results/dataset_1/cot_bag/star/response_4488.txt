Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's examine each node to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 4, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed is: \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [9] \)

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
