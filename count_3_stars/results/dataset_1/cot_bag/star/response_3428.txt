Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 14 edges:
```
       1
       |
       8
      / \
     5   6--9
     |  /|\
     7-8 |
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (8): no 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (6): no 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 8): 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (2, 7, 8, 9, 9): 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8): 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8): 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (6): no 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [1 + 10 + 1 + 4] = 16 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <5, (7, 8, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 8)>
- <6, (8, 7, 9)>
- <6, (8, 7, 9)>
- <6, (8, 9, 7)>
- <6, (9, 7, 8)>
- <6, (9, 8, 7)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 1)>
- <8, (5, 6, 1)>
- <8, (6, 5, 1)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 6, 9)>
- <8, (9, 6, 7)>
