Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 2:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars involving node 2.

Node 3:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
So, there is 1 3-star involving node 3.

Node 7:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 3-stars involving node 7.

Adding these up:
\[ [4 + 1 + 4] = 9 \]

So, there are a total of 9 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<2, (0, 7, 4)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 2)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 3)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (3, 0, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
