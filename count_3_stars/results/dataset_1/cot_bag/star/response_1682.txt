Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, and <9, (0, 5, 6)>.
