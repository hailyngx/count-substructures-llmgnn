Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 2, 7)>
<1, (9, 7, 0)>
<2, (7, 5, 0)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 9, 0)>
<9, (1, 7, 0)>
