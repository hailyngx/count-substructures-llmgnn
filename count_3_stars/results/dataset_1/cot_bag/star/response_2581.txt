Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually with the given information:

```
0 -- 9
1 -- 5
2 -- 6
3 -- 9
|  / | \
5 -- 7  8
```

Now, we'll find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8), which gives \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 5: 
  - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (6, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
  
- Node 6 also has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 9), which gives \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 6:
  - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 8), which gives \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 9:
  - <9, (0, 3, 6)>
  - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (0, 6, 3)>
  - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
  
Calculating the total number of 3-stars and listing the unique ones:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>,
<6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>,
<9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 3)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
