Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list each node with its neighbors:  
Node 0: 4, 9   
Node 1: 6, 8  
Node 2: 3, 7  
Node 3: 2, 9  
Node 4: 0  
Node 6: 1, 7, 8  
Node 7: 2, 6, 9  
Node 8: 1, 6  
Node 9: 0, 3, 7  

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9.
Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) forming <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) forming <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) forming <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3.  
Final answer: [3]
