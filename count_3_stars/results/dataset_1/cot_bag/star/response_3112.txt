Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 1, 4
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $[1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5]$.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
