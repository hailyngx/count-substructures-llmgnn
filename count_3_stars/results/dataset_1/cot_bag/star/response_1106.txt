Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 have at least three neighbors, making them potential centers of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 49 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 9, 0)> 

Therefore, the final count is [49].
