Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 15

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 1, 8)>
<9, (2, 8, 1)>

So, the final answer is [15].
