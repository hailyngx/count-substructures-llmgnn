Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1, 4, 5, and 6 each have 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1, 4, 5, and 6: For each of these nodes, there is only one 3-star formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 4 = 24 \). 

Inside brackets [], we have the total number of 3-stars which is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
