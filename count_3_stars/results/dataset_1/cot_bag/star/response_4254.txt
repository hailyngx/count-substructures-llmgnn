Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visually represent the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- 1: 8, 9
- 2: 3
- 3: 0, 2, 6
- 4: 8, 9
- 5: 0, 8, 9
- 6: 0, 3, 7
- 7: 0, 6
- 8: 0, 1, 4, 5
- 9: 1, 4, 5

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: 
\[ [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [18] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 0, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
