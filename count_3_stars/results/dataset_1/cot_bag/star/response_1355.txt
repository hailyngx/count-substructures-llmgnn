Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10 + 10 + 4 = 24.

Inside brackets, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 2, 7)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
