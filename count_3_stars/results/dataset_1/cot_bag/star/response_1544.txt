Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 0 neighbors

Calculating the total 3-stars:
For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: Since Node 3 has 3 neighbors, there's 1 3-star
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Adding these up, there are \(4+4+1+4+4+1=18\) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
