Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 8.

For node 0:
- It has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8.
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars involving node 0: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
- It has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 9.
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star involving node 4: <4, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 6:
- It has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8.
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star involving node 6: <6, (0, 7, 8)>

For node 8:
- It has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 9.
- Number of 3-stars formed by node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star involving node 8: <8, (0, 6, 9)>

Overall, there are 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 3-stars in this graph. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
