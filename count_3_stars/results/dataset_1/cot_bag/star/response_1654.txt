Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors. We will apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 7}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 7, 8)>.
