Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's go through each node to see which nodes it is connected to:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by applying the formula mentioned earlier. Let's summarize the results:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
