Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each such node.

Given the edges provided, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5 (4 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (6, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (9, 0, 3)>
- <5, (9, 0, 8)>
- <5, (9, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 7, 1)>
- <6, (7, 1, 9)>
- <6, (7, 1, 0)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (2, 1, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 0)>
- <9, (5, 0, 1)>
