Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 4: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 6: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 8: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 9: [2 choose 3] = 0

Adding these up, we get a total of 29 3-stars.
