Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 8 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed using these nodes:

For node 2: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 58, which we will put inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>

So the final answer is: [58], <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>
