Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To start, let's visualize the graph by listing the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4. Writing out the unique 3-stars in the graph, we have:

\[ [4] \]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
