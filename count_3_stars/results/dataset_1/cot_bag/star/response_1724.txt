Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. 
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2 

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed from nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 30

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [30].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
