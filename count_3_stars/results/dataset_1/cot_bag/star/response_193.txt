Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 4

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<7, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (3, 7)>
