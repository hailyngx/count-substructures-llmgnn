Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (1, 7, 8)>.
- Node 2: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
- Node 4: There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>.
- Node 7: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 8: There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 3)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 3)>, <8, (7, 9, 3)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 36 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
