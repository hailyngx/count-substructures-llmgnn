Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2

The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
