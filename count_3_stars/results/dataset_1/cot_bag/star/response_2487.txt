Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \) which gives us the final count as [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (8, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (5, 1, 2)>
