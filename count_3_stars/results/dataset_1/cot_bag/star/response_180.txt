Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 2, 6, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 2: Since node 2 has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.

- Node 6: Since node 6 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 9: Since node 9 has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a final count of \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [10] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>.

So, the final answer is \[10\] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>.
