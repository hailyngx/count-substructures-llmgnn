Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

We can see that the nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [30]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
