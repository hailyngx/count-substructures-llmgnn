Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. These are the potential center nodes for 3-stars.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these potential center nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18, which we will represent as [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
