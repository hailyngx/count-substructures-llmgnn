Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, and 9.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star = <0, (4, 5, 8)>

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star = <1, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars = <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-star = <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7.
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [7].
