Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are (10 choose 3) = 120 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are (5 choose 3) = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are (4 choose 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 120 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 147.

Therefore, the final result is [147], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
