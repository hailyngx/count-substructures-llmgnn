Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph based on the given edges:

```
    1 -- 5 -- 2
    |    |    |
    0 -- 4 -- 3
           |
           8
           |
           9
```

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
  - There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to form a 3-star with node 0: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 has only 1 neighbor: 5
  - Node 1 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5
  - Node 2 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
  - Node 3 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 8
  - There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to form 3-stars with node 4: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4
  - There are 6 choose 3 = 20 ways to form 3-stars with node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, ..., <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 0
  - Node 6 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 4
  - Node 8 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 0
  - Node 9 cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: [1 + 4 + 20] = [25]

Therefore, the graph contains 25 unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, ..., <5, (3, 4, 8)>
