Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: choose 3 out of 3 neighbors = 1 3-star
- For Node 1: choose 3 out of 2 neighbors = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 2: choose 3 out of 4 neighbors = 4 3-stars
- For Node 4: choose 3 out of 3 neighbors = 1 3-star
- For Node 5: choose 3 out of 2 neighbors = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 6: choose 3 out of 1 neighbor = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 7: choose 3 out of 3 neighbors = 1 3-star
- For Node 8: choose 3 out of 2 neighbors = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- For Node 9: choose 3 out of 4 neighbors = 4 3-stars

Summing up, there are a total of [1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4] = 11 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 2, 7, 8>
<(0, 2, 7), 9>
<1, 2, 9>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 4, 7>
<2, 7, 9>
<4, 2, 5>
<4, 5, 9>
<7, 0, 9>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, 7, 8>
