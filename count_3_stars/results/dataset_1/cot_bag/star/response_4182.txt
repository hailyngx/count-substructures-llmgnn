Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all these 3-stars gives a total of 51 3-stars.
Thus, the answer is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>
