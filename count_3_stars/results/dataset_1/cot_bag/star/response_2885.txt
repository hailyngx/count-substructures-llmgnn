Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Let's visualize the graph structure:

```
        0 - 4 - 7
        |       |
        9 - 3 - 6 - 1
        |       |
        5       2
```

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 9, 6), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6, 6), so it can form 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [4 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [25].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
- <3, {2, 6, 9}>
- <4, {0, 7, 9}>
- <6, {1, 5, 7}>
- <6, {1, 5, 9}>
- <6, {3, 5, 7}>
- <6, {3, 5, 9}>
- <6, {3, 7, 9}>
- <6, {5, 7, 9}>
- <9, {3, 4, 5}>
- <9, {3, 4, 6}>
- <9, {3, 5, 6}>
- <9, {4, 5, 6}>
- <9, {4, 6, 6}>
- <9, {5, 6, 6}>
