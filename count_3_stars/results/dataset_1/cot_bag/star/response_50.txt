Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of 36 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars are listed above.
