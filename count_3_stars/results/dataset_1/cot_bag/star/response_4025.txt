Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7} => 4 neighbors
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 7} => 5 neighbors
Node 6: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 9} => 4 neighbors
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 6} => 4 neighbors

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>.
