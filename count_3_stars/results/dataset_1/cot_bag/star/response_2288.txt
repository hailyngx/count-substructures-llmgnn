Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 5.

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>.

So, the final answer is [5].
