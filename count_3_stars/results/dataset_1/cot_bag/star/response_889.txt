Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 1, 3, 5
- 1 is connected to 0, 2, 9
- 2 is connected to 1, 4, 9
- 3 is connected to 0, 9
- 4 is connected to 2, 6, 7
- 5 is connected to 0, 6
- 6 is connected to 4, 5, 7
- 7 is connected to 4, 6
- 9 is connected to 1, 2, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node, we need to check if it has 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3), so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 0, 2>
<2, 1, 4>
<4, 2, 6>

So, the final answer is [4].
