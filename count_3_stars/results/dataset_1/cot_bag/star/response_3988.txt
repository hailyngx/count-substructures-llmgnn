Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 8).
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (0, 7).
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0, 5).
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (1, 7).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (3, 8).
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor (7).
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 8, 9).
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 9).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (7, 8).

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
