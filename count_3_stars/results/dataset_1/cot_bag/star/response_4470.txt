Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>
- Node 9: has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 5)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated for each node, we get a total of 81 3-stars in this graph. So, the final count is [81].
