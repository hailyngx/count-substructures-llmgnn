Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1 with 4 neighbors:

\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 2 with 6 neighbors:

\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For node 3 with 3 neighbors:

\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 5 with 3 neighbors:

\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 7 with 3 neighbors:

\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 8 with 4 neighbors:

\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Summing these up, we get:

\[ 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31 \]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 1, 7)>
