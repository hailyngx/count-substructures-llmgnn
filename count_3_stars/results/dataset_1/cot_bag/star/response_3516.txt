Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will examine each node to see if it can form a 3-star. Since a 3-star requires exactly 3 edges connected to the center node, we will list out all the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 6
Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 0, 1, 3
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4
Node 9: 1, 2

Now, we will check each node for the number of 3-stars it can form:

Node 1 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 23 3-stars in the graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>.
