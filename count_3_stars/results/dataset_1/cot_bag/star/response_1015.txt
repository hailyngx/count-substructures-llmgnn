Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (4, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 1)>
