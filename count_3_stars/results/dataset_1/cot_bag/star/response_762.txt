Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has neighbors {5, 7, 9}
  There are 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 2 has neighbors {4, 6, 8}
  There are 1 3-star with node 2: <2, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 3 has neighbors {6, 8, 9}
  There are 1 3-star with node 3: <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 4 has neighbors {2}
  Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 1, 7}
  There are 1 3-star with node 5: <5, (0, 1, 7)>

- Node 6 has neighbors {2, 3, 7}
  There are 1 3-star with node 6: <6, (2, 3, 7)>

- Node 7 has neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9}
  There are 1 3-star with node 7: <7, (1, 5, 6)>

- Node 8 has neighbors {2, 3}
  Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

- Node 9 has neighbors {1, 3, 7}
  There are 1 3-star with node 9: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
