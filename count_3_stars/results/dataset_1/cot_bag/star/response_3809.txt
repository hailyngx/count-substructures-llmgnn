Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
    0 -- 9
    |     |
    9 -- 4 -- 2 -- 8
    |     |
    7     5 -- 1
          |     |
          6     3
```

Now, let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 4 can form 1 3-star each.
- Node 5 and Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 10.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 9, 0)>, <4, (9, 0, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 1)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 3, 1)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 0)>, <9, (4, 0, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 0)>
