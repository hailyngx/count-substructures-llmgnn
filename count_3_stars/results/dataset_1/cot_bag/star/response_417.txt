Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 5), (5, 3), (5, 9), (6, 2), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, for each node, we will count the number of 3-stars it participates in:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 7, 8) -> [1 3-star formed] 
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7, 8) -> [inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars formed]
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (2, 5) -> [0 3-stars formed]
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (3, 9) -> [0 3-stars formed]
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (2) -> [0 3-stars formed]
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (1, 2) -> [0 3-stars formed]
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9) -> [1 3-star formed]
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (5, 8) -> [1 3-star formed]

Adding up the counts of 3-stars for each node, we have a total of [1 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1] = [13].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 2)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, and <9, (5, 8, 1)>.

So, the final answer is [13].
