Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to node 1: (0, 1) and vice versa: (1, 0)
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6)
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4: (2, 1), (2, 4)
- Node 3 is connected to node 4: (3, 4)
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7)
- Node 5 is connected to node 1: (5, 1)
- Node 6 is connected to node 1: (6, 1)
- Node 7 is connected to node 4: (7, 4)

Now, let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (not enough to form a 3-star)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (can form 1 3-star)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (not enough to form a 3-star)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (not enough to form a 3-star)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (can form 1 3-star)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (not enough to form a 3-star)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (not enough to form a 3-star)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (not enough to form a 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) = 2
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
