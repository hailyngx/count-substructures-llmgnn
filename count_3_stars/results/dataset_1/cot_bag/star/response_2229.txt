Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For node 0, there are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- For node 1, there are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- For node 4, there are 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- For node 7, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- For node 8, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is $1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24$.

Putting this final number inside brackets [] gives us [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 6, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
4. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
5. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
6. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
7. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
8. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
9. <5, (4, 7, 8)>
10. <5, (7, 8, 9)>
11. <7, (0, 5, 8)>
12. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
13. <7, (5, 6, 4)>
14. <7, (5, 8, 4)>
15. <8, (1, 5, 7)>
16. <8, (5, 6, 7)>
