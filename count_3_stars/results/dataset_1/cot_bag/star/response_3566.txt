Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbor {3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For Node 1: 
- Neighbors {6, 8, 9}
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <1, (6, 8, 9)>

Since Node 1 is the only node with exactly 3 neighbors, we found 1 unique 3-star.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
