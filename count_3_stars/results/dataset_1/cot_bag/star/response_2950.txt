Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges:  

```
       0 -- 4 -- 8
       |    |      
       6    1 -- 5
                 |
                 9
                 |
                 3 -- 7
                 |
                 2
```

Now, we will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 1: \<1, (3, 4, 5)\>
- Node 2: \<2, (3, 5, 7)\>
- Node 3: \<3, (1, 2, 5)\>
- Node 4: \<4, (0, 1, 9)\>
- Node 5: No 3-stars since it has exactly 3 neighbors
- Node 6: No 3-stars since it has exactly 1 neighbor
- Node 7: \<7, (2, 3, 5)\>
- Node 8: No 3-stars since it has exactly 2 neighbors
- Node 9: No 3-stars since it has exactly 3 neighbors

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
