Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Total number of 3-stars = [21]

<0, (6, 1, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (8, 7, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (5, 8, 7)>
<8, (2, 9, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
