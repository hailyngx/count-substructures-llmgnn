Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, making it a candidate for forming 3-stars. Node 3 also has 5 neighbors. Node 9 has 2 neighbors. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
The 3-stars with node 2 as the center can be: 
<2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 5)>, <2, (3, 7, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (7, 8, 4)>, <2, (7, 4, 6)>, <2, (8, 4, 6)>

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
The 3-stars with node 3 as the center can be: 
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 1, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (7, 5, 6)>

For node 9: No 3-stars can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
