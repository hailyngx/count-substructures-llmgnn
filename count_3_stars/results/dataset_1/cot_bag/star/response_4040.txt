Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 8, 2)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
