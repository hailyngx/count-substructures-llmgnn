Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can analyze each node to find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors (3, 6) → No 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5) → 1 3-star
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (1, 3) → No 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6) → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 8) → \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 7) → 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 8) → 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (5) → No 3-star
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (4, 6) → No 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

So, the final answer is [10] with the unique 3-stars being:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
