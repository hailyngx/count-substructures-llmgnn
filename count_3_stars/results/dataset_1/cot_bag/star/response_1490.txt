Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {3, 8}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: {7, 9}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {0, 2}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 25 \), which we can represent as [25]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 0, 8)>
- <3, (5, 9, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (7, 3, 9)>
