Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, node 4 has 3 neighbors, node 5 has 3 neighbors, node 6 has 3 neighbors, and node 8 has 4 neighbors. 

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 17 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
1. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <1, (5, 8, 9)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <5, (0, 1, 8)>
6. <8, (1, 5, 6)>
