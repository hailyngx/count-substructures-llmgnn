Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), 
(1, 5), 
(2, 0), 
(3, 6), 
(4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), 
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 9), 
(6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), 
(7, 0), (7, 6), 
(8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 9), 
(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8)
```

Now we'll find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>,
<0, (7, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>,
<8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>
