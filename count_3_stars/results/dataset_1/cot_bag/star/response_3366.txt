Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. 

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the central node. 
For node 3, there are 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the central node. 
For node 4, there are 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the central node. 
For node 5, there are 3 neighbors (0, 3, 8), so there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the central node. 
For node 6, there are 3 neighbors (0, 4, 8), so there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the central node. 
For node 7, there are 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the central node. 
For node 9, there are 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 7), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the central node.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 34 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
