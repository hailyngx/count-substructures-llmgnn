Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 8
- Node 7 is connected to node 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [13] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
