Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine which nodes have 3 or more neighbors. From the given edge list, we can see that nodes 0, 3, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, node 1 and 8 have 3 neighbors each, and the remaining nodes have less than 3 neighbors. 

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 1: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
For node 8: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding these up, we get a total of 32 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (6, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 8, 6)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 4, 9)>
<3, (8, 1, 0)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (9, 8, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 3, 0)>
