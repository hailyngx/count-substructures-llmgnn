Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9)
(1, 4)
(3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9)
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
(5, 6), (5, 7)
(6, 5), (6, 8)
(7, 3), (7, 5)
(8, 0), (8, 6)
(9, 0), (9, 3)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: Has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9), so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3: Has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 3), so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 6: Has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 7: Has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 8: Has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.
- Node 9: Has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 3 (1 from each of the nodes 0, 3, 4). 

Therefore, the answer is the total number of 3-stars: [3]
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>.
