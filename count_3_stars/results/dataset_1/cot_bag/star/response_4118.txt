Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to analyze the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes have the potential to form 3-stars. 

From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 2 with neighbors 3, 5, 8
- Node 3 with neighbors 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5 with neighbors 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 with neighbors 3, 5, 7, 8

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 10 + 20 + 4] = 35 \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>

- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
