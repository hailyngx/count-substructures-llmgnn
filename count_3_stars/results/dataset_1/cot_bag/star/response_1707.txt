Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 56

So, the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>.
