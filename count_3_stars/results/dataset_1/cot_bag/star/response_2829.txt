Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 0)

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9} => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 7, 8} => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 8} => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {1, 4} => 0 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {3, 6, 7} => 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 8} => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {4, 7} => 0 3-stars
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 6} => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 5} => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: {0} => 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 41 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
