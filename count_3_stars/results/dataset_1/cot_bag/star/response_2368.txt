Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph as follows:
```
Graph:
     0 --- 3 --- 7 --- 8
     |     |     |     |
     8     2     3     7
     |     |     |     |
     3 --- 1 --- 4     9
     |     |     |      
     9     5     |      
     |           |     
     0 --- 6 --- 2
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Forms 3-stars:
  - <0, (3, 8, 6)>
  - <0, (3, 1, 5)>

- Node 1: Forms 3-stars:
  - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 5)>

- Node 2: Forms 3-stars:
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)>

- Node 3: Forms 3-stars:
  - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
  - <3, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: Forms 3-stars:
  - <5, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <5, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <5, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 7: Forms 3-stars:
  - <7, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <7, (7, 8, 9)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: 11
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
