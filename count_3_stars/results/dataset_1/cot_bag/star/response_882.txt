Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors to check for potential 3-stars. 
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>
