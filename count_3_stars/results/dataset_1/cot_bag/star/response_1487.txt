Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 4)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>.
