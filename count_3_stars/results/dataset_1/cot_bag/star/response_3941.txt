Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 1: neighbors - 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: neighbors - 0, 5
Node 3: neighbors - 1, 9
Node 5: neighbors - 1, 2, 4, 6
Node 6: neighbors - 1, 5, 7, 8

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
Node 1: \( {{5}\choose{3}} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( {{4}\choose{3}} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( {{4}\choose{3}} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 

So, the final answer is [18]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
