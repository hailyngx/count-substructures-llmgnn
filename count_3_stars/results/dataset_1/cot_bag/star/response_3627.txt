Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}    

Now, let's determine which nodes have at least three neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors
Node 1 has 1 neighbor
Node 2 has 1 neighbor
Node 3 has 2 neighbors
Node 4 has 5 neighbors
Node 7 has 2 neighbors
Node 8 has 3 neighbors
Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Thus, Node 4 and Node 8 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 = 11.

Hence, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
