Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 64 \).

Therefore, the answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
