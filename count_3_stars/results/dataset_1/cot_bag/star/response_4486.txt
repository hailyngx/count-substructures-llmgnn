Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following degrees:  
0: 3  
2: 2  
3: 2  
4: 4  
5: 4  
6: 4  
7: 4  
8: 4  
9: 2  

Based on the degrees of the nodes, we can see that nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 each have 4 neighbors, making them potential centers for 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (8, 5, 9)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 6)>

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 4)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Add up all the 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
