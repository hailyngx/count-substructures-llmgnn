Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 3: neighbor {8}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: neighbor {0}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 4}

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars per node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 11.

Therefore, there are 11 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's list them:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>
