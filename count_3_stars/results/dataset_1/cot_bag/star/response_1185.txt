Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Some of the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
