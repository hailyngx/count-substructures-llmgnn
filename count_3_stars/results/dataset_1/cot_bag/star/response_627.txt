Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 4 + 4] = 28 \).

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>.
