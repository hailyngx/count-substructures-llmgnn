Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 8. 

Therefore, there are a total of 8 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<1, 0, 2>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 9, 2>
<1, 9, 4>
<7, 3, 8>
<7, 5, 6>
<7, 5, 6>
<7, 6, 5> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
