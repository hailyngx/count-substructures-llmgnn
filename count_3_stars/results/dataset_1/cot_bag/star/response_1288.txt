Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: Forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: Forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
