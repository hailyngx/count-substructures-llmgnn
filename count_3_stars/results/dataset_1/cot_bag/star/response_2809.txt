Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 5, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0, 5), which is not enough to form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (0, 4), which is not enough to form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (4, 5), which is not enough to form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2, 5), which is not enough to form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2), so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46]. 
The unique 3-stars formed are: <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>.
