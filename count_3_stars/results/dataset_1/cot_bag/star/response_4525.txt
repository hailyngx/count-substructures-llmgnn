Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

The 10 nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges are:
(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)
(1, 4), (1, 9)
(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8)
(3, 4), (3, 7)
(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)
(5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8)
(6, 4), (6, 5)
(7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4)
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 9)
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 8)

We will now find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>
