Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we need to find and count the number of 3-stars.

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 48 \)

So, the final answer is [48] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>.
