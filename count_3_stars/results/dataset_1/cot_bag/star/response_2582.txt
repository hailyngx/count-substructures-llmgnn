Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 7

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 3 also forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9: <3, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
