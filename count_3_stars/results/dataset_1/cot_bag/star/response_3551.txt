Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list down the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 3, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Based on the list of neighbors, we see that the nodes 1, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, 9: <1, (3, 4, 9)>

For Node 6:
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 5: <6, (1, 2, 5)>

For Node 8:
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 5, 9: <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, and <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
