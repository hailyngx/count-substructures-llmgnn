Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

```
    0 --- 5 --- 6
   /      |  X  |   \
  4       7 --- 3    2
   \      |  X  |   /
    8 --- 1 --- 9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars formed around them.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 5, 8, 9.

For node 1:
- 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 7, 3)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (4, 8, 6)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (3, 7, 6)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (8, 4, 6)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 8, 1)>

For node 8:
- 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 9, 4)>
- 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 6, 9)>

For node 9:
- 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 7 (from node 5) + 2 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 11

Therefore, the final result is [11].
