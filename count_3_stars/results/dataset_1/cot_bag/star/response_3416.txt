Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph based on the information provided:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 0), (5, 2), (5, 8), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 1)}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 8, 8)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} = 1 + 10 + 0 = 11 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8, 8)>
- <2, (1, 8, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 0, 5)>
- <8, (2, 1, 5)>
- <8, (2, 0, 1)>
