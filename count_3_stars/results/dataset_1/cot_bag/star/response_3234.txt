Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3 has only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has only 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
