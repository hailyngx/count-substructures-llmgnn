Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are provided. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9)
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors
- Node 2: has 1 neighbor
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: has 1 neighbor
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 8: has 1 neighbor
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 9)

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 12 \]

So, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 9, 0)>
- <3, (7, 0, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
