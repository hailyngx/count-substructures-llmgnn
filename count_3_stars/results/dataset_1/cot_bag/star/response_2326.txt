Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 4: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
- Node 5: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 7: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- Node 9: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [60].  

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
