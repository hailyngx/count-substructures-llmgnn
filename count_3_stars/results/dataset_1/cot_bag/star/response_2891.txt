Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {0, 4}
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {1, 4}
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
  - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (2, 3, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <5, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <5, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <5, (1, 8, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (1, 3, 5)>
  - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <8, (1, 5, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <9, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [17] \]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>.
