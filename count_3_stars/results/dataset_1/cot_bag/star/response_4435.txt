Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a few nodes in the graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (1, 5) - no 3-star can be formed.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6) - 1 3-star can be formed.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 8, 4) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed: 
   <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 4)>, <4, (1, 8, 4)>, <4, (3, 8, 4)>
4. Node 5 has 2 neighbors (0, 6) - no 3-star can be formed.
5. Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 9) - \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed: 
   <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

So, there are a total of 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final result is [9]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 4)>, <4, (1, 8, 4)>, <4, (3, 8, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>.
