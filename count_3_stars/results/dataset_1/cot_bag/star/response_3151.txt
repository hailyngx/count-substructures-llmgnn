Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 7), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 0), (9, 4)

Next, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars in the graph. 

Node 0: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6, 8) => [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 7) => 1 3-star with <1, (0, 6, 7)>

Node 2: 2 neighbors (0, 5) => No 3-stars

Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7) => 1 3-star with <5, (0, 2, 7)>

Node 6: 2 neighbors (0, 1) => No 3-stars

Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5) => 1 3-star with <7, (1, 3, 5)>

Node 8: 1 neighbor (0) => No 3-stars

Node 9: 1 neighbor (4) => No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10 + 1 + 1] = [12]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, and <7, (1, 3, 5)>.
