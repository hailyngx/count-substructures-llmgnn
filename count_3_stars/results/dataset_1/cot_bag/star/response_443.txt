Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph with the given nodes and edges:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 5)
```

Now, let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars are formed:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 8) -> [1 3-star] -> Total 3-stars: 1
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (2, 7, 8, 9) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars -> Total 3-stars: 5
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 8) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars -> Total 3-stars: 9
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (0, 4) -> No 3-star
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 8) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars -> Total 3-stars: 13
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9) -> [1 3-star] -> Total 3-stars: 14
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (2, 4) -> No 3-star
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (1, 5) -> No 3-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars -> Total 3-stars: 18
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (1, 5) -> No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 18. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
