Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up these counts, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
