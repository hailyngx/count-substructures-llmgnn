Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. 

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {2, 7, 9}, forming 1 3-star with center node 1.
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 7}, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {5, 6, 7, 8}, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 8}, forming 1 3-star with center node 4.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 6}, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 3}, forming 1 3-star with center node 7.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 3)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<5, (4, 3, 6)>, and 
<7, (1, 2, 3)>.
