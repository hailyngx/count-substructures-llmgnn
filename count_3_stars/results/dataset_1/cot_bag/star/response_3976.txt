Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 37.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [37].

The 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 3, 7)>, <2, (7, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 4, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
