Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 36 \]

So, there are 36 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ [36] \]

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
