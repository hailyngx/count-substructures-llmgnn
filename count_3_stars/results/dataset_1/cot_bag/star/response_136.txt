Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{0}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (only 1 3-star with node 3 as the center)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (only 1 3-star with node 5 as the center)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{0}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

There are no 3-stars in the given graph, so the total number of 3-stars is 0. Therefore, the final answer is [0].
