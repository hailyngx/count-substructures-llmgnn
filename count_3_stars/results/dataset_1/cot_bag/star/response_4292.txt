Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0 (with 3 neighbors): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 (with 2 neighbors): Can't form a 3-star
- Node 2 (with 5 neighbors): [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 3 (with 4 neighbors): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 (with 3 neighbors): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 5 (with 3 neighbors): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6 (with 4 neighbors): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 (with 3 neighbors): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8 (with 2 neighbors): Can't form a 3-star
- Node 9 (with 3 neighbors): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Adding them up:
1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
