Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 2: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- Node 8: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 9: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19

Thus, the total number of 3-stars = [19].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
