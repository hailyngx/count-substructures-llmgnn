Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 44 edges, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. From the edge list provided, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that each of these nodes forms:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with Node 0.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with Node 1.
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars formed with Node 3.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with Node 5.
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars formed with Node 7.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with Node 8.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed with these nodes, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 35 + 20 = 114 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [114].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (3, 0, 5)>
- <7, (3, 0, 8)>
- <7, (3, 1, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 0, 7)>
- <8, (3, 0, 7)>
