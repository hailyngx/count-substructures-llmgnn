Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [15] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
