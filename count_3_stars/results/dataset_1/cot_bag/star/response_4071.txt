Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph based on the given edges and nodes:

```
   0 ----- 1 ----- 8
   |       |       |
   |       |      /
   |       |     /
   7 ----- 2 - 9
    \      |  /
     \     | /
      4 -- 3
           |
           5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for the eligible nodes:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 20 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
