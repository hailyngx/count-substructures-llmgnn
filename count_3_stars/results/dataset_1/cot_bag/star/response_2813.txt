Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \[13\].
