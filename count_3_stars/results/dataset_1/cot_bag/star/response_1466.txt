Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph using the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 8), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 0)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each such node:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 3, 8)
Number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (1, 3, 5, 6)
Number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 8)
Number of 3-stars for node 5: 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = 4 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
