Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 5, 8
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 5
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 8, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 6
Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
