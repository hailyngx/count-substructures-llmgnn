Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 4, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to Node 6
- Node 4 is connected to Node 1
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 2, 7, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2 and 5
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1 and 6
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 5 and 6

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:

- Node 2 (3 stars) -> <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 6 (3 stars) -> <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>
