Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{0}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
