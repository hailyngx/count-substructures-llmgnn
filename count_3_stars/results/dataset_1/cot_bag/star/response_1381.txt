Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 6 -- 1 -- 9
    |         | / |
    8 -- 3    5   2
     \       |   |
      4 -- 7 -- 9
```  

For this graph with 10 nodes, let's find the number of 3-stars.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 8, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, and 9, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 9, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 9, and 4, forming 4 3-stars.  
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 8, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 6, forming 1 3-star.  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 4, forming 1 3-star.  

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars [].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (6, 8, 3)>  
<1, (5, 6, 9)>  
<2, (4, 9, 2)>  
<4, (2, 7, 9)>  
<6, (0, 1, 8)>  
<8, (0, 3, 6)>  
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
