Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the total number of 3-stars, let's first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 3, and 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 3, 5), 1 3-star (0, 3, 7) = 2
- Node 3: 1 3-star (3, 0, 5), 1 3-star (3, 0, 7), 1 3-star (3, 5, 7) = 3
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 1, 7) = 1
- Node 5: 1 3-star (5, 0, 3) = 1
- Node 7: 1 3-star (7, 0, 3) = 1

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 8.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<4, 1, 7>
<5, 0, 3>
<7, 0, 3>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
