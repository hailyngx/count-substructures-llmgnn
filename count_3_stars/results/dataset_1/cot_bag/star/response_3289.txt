Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Looking at the list of edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, forming 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 1, 7>
<1, 0, 7>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 9>
<2, 1, 7>
<2, 6, 7>
<6, 2, 7>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 1, 2>
<7, 1, 6>
