Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

```
0 --- 9
 \     \
  \     5
   \   / \
    1     2 - 6 - 7
                  |
                  3
```

Now let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors
- Nodes 1, 2, and 5 have 2 neighbors each

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 10] = 30 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
