Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
After examining the graph and applying the rules for 3-star graphs, we find the following:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Since each of these nodes forms one unique 3-star, the final count of 3-stars is [7].
