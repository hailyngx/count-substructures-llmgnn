Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 3.
Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 = 18.

So, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (3, 0, 2)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
