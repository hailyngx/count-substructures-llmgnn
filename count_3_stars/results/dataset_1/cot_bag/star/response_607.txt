Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: {(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (8, 1), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 19 \), which should be written inside brackets as [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (4, 9, 0)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
