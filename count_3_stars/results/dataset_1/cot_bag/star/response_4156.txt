Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} \) = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \) which will be represented as [6].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, and <6, (0, 8, 9)>.
