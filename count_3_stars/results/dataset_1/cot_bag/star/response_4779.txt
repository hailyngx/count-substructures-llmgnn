Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars formed are:

- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 0)>
