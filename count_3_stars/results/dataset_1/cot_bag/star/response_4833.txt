Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this case are as follows:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 7: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 6, and 7: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, and 9: <7, (1, 5, 9)>

Counting these combinations, we get a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
