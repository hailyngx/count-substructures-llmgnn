Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {6, 7}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. 

For Node 0: 
- There are 5 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
For Node 4: 
- There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed.
  
For Node 7: 
- There are 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 4 = 15. 

Therefore, the final answer is [15] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>
