Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 8

Following the method mentioned earlier, we find that the total number of 3-stars is 21.

So, the answer is:
\[ [21] \]
And the unique 3-stars are:
\[ <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)> \]
