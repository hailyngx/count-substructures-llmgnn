Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars 
- Node 3 has 7 3-stars 
- Node 5 has 4 3-stars 
- Node 8 has 5 3-stars 
- Node 9 has 4 3-stars 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 7 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 9, 8)>
<5, (8, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (9, 9, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 8)>
<9, (8, 9, 5)>
<9, (8, 9, 7)>
