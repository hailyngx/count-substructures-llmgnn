Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 9
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 5, 6>
<5, 1, 2, 6>
