Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Based on the nodes and their neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<6, 0, 8>
