Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8
- There are 3 possible 3-stars with Node 0 as the center: <> (0, 3, 4), <> (0, 4, 5), <> (0, 3, 8)

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- There is 1 possible 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <> (1, 2, 6)

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 8
- There is 1 possible 3-star with Node 2 as the center: <> (2, 1, 6)

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
- There is 1 possible 3-star with Node 3 as the center: <> (3, 0, 4)

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 4 cannot form a 3-star with only 2 neighbors.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
- There are 3 possible 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: <> (5, 0, 8), <> (5, 7, 8), <> (5, 7, 9)

For Node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- There is 1 possible 3-star with Node 6 as the center: <> (6, 1, 2)

For Node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- There are 3 possible 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: <> (7, 1, 6), <> (7, 3, 5), <> (7, 5, 8)

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7
- There are 3 possible 3-stars with Node 8 as the center: <> (8, 0, 5), <> (8, 2, 7), <> (8, 5, 7)

For Node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
- There is 1 possible 3-star with Node 9 as the center: <> (9, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 6>, <5, 0, 8>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <6, 1, 2>, <7, 1, 6>, <7, 3, 5>, <7, 5, 8>, <8, 0, 5>, <8, 2, 7>, <8, 5, 7>, <9, 5, 6>.
