Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 15 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 15 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (9, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
