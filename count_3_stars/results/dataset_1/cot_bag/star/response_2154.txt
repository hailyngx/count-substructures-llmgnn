Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to node 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [1 + 1 + 1] = [3] \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
