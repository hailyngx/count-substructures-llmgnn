Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9 (total 4 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 5 (total 2 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 9 (total 4 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6 (total 4 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \)

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (8, 9, 5)>
- <1, (2, 9, 5)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 9, 2)>
- <5, (2, 9, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 4)>
