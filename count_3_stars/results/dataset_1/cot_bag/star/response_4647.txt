Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 3, 5, 6
- 1 is connected to 3, 5, 9
- 2 is connected to 4, 8
- 3 is connected to 0, 1, 7
- 4 is connected to 2, 9
- 5 is connected to 0, 1, 9
- 6 is connected to 0, 7
- 7 is connected to 3, 6, 8
- 8 is connected to 2, 7
- 9 is connected to 1, 4, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6), hence it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9), hence it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7), hence it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9), hence it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8), hence it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5), hence it can form 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
