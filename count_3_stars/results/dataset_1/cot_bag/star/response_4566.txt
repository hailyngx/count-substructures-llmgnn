Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 7. 

For node 0:
- <0, 1, 6, 8>

For node 1:
- <1, 0, 2, 5>

For node 7:
- <7, 2, 4, 5>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
