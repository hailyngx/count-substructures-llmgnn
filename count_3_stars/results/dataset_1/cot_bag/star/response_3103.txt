Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 --- 9
|      
1 --- 2    3 --- 4 --- 7
|         / |   / | 
|       /    | /   | 
|     5 --- 6 --- 9
|   /      
8
```

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (6 neighbors)
Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (7 neighbors)
Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (4 neighbors)
Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 9), (3 neighbors)
Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9 neighbors)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)> (Total: 10)

Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
<4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)> (Total: 4)

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (1, 4, 6)> (Total: 1)

Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<6, (1, 5, 9)> (Total: 1)

Node 9: \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \)
<9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)> (Total: 10)

Adding up the totals: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].
