Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll examine each node that has at least 3 neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

For the given graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {4, 5, 7}.
  - 1 3-star can be formed with node 2 as the center: <2, (4, 5, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 7}.
  - 4 3-stars can be formed with node 3 as the center: 
    <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 7}.
  - 5 3-stars can be formed with node 4 as the center: 
    <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {2, 3, 6}.
  - 1 3-star can be formed with node 5 as the center: <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}.
  - 5 3-stars can be formed with node 7 as the center: 
    <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 5] = 16.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>.
