Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 9. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1 3-star can be formed (total: 1)
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 1 3-star can be formed (total: 2)
3. Node 5 has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars can be formed (total: 22)
4. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1 3-star can be formed (total: 23)
5. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star can be formed (total: 24)

So, there are total [24] 3-stars.  
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
