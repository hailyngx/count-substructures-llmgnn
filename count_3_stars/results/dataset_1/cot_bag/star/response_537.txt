Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

From the given edge list, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (3, 7, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6). So, it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 5). So, it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 34 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 5)>
