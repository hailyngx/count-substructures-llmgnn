Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.

Putting these 4 unique 3-stars inside <>: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
