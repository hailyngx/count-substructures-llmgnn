Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Number of 3-stars with node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars with node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars with node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 0, 1)>
