Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 62 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
