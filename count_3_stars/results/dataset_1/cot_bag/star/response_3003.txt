Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Adjacent nodes for each node:
Node 0: 3, 9
Node 1: 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 0
Node 4: 6, 9
Node 5: 1, 7, 9
Node 6: 1, 4, 7
Node 7: 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
From the list above, nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For node 1: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For node 5: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For node 6: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For node 7: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For node 9: C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
