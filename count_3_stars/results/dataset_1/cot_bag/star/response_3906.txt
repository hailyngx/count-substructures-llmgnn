Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
