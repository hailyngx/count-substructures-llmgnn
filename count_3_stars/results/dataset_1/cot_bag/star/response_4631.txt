Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.

Next, we'll find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4: As node 4 has 6 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  The unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
    - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (2, 8, 6)>
    - <4, (2, 9, 6)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 6)>
    - <4, (5, 9, 6)>
    - <4, (8, 9, 6)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 3)>
    - <4, (2, 8, 3)>
    - <4, (2, 9, 3)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 3)>
    - <4, (5, 9, 3)>
    - <4, (8, 9, 3)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 0)>
    - <4, (2, 8, 0)>
    - <4, (2, 9, 0)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 0)>

- Node 6: Node 6 has 5 neighbors, but as it is not a leaf node, it cannot form any 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
