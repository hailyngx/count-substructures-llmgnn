Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 5, and 9. 

For node 0:
- inom{5}{3} = 10
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 2:
- inom{4}{3} = 4
<2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>

For node 5:
- inom{4}{3} = 4
<5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
- inom{5}{3} = 10
<9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Putting all the unique 3-stars found inside brackets [] gives us a total of [29].
