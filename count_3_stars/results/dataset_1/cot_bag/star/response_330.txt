Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6) -> 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8) -> 1 3-star
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9) -> 1 3-star
Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9) -> 1 3-star
Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9) -> 1 3-star
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9) -> 1 3-star
Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8) -> 1 3-star

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is 6.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
