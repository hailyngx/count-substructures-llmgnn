Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Looking at each node, we see that:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 6, 7
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 5, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

So, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (8, 5, 4)>
<1, (4, 8, 8)>
<1, (8, 8, 4)>
<1, (5, 8, 8)>
<1, (8, 4, 5)>
