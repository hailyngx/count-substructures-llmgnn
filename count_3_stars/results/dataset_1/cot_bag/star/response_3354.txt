Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

0: 4, 8, 9
1: 4, 5
2: 4
3: 6, 8, 9
4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
5: 1, 6, 8, 9
6: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
7: 4
8: 0, 3, 5, 6
9: 0, 3, 5, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.

Adding all the contributions together: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are 34 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [34].
