Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. 

Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [38].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
