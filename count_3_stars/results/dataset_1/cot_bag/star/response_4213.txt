Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors.

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 6, 9.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars involving node 4 are: 
  <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 9. It can form 1 3-star with node 4: <5, (4, 8, 9)>.

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars involving node 6 are:
  <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars involving node 9 are:
  <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>,
  <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>,
<9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
