Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, we can determine that nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
