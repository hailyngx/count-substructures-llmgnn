Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:

Node 0: 2, 4, 5
Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 2: 0, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 8
Node 6: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 9: 2, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
