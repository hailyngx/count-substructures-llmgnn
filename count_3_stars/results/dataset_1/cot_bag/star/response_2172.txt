Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 4, and 6.

For node 1:
There are 3 possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>,  
<1, (4, 6, 2)>,  
<1, (6, 2, 4)>.

For node 4:
There are also 3 possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>,  
<4, (3, 1, 8)>,  
<4, (8, 1, 3)>.

For node 6:
There are 3 possible 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 
<6, (1, 5, 7)>,  
<6, (5, 1, 7)>,  
<6, (7, 1, 5)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph, as calculated by summing up the 3-stars formed by nodes 1, 4, and 6.
