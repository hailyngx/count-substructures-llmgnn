Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 4.
  - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 2, 4)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, and 9.
  - There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 7.
  - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 9. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, and 9.
  - There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 9. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, and 9.
  - There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 7 and 9. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
  - There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Combining all the 3-stars found: [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [24]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 24.
