Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the only nodes that can form a 3-star.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:  
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 5, 7)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
