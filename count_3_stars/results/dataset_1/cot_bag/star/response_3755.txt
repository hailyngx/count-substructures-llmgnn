Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6.
- Number of 3-stars at node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars at node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)>

Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5.
- Number of 3-stars at node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars at node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)>

Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 9.
- Number of 3-stars at node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars at node 4: <4, (0, 7, 9)>

Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, 9.
- Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars at node 6: 
  <6, (0, 3, 7)>, 
  <6, (0, 7, 8)>, 
  <6, (0, 8, 9)>,
  <6, (3, 7, 9)>, 
  <6, (3, 7, 8)>,
  <6, (3, 8, 9)>, 
  <6, (7, 8, 9)>,
  <6, (0, 3, 9)>, 
  <6, (0, 8, 7)>,
  <6, (0, 9, 7)>

Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9.
- Number of 3-stars at node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars at node 7: 
  <7, (4, 8, 9)>, 
  <7, (6, 8, 9)>, 
  <7, (4, 9, 6)>, 
  <7, (6, 9, 8)>

Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8.
- Number of 3-stars at node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars at node 9: 
  <9, (2, 6, 7)>, 
  <9, (2, 6, 8)>, 
  <9, (2, 7, 8)>, 
  <9, (4, 6, 7)>, 
  <9, (4, 6, 8)>,
  <9, (4, 7, 8)>, 
  <9, (6, 7, 8)>, 
  <9, (6, 4, 7)>, 
  <9, (6, 4, 8)>, 
  <9, (6, 8, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
