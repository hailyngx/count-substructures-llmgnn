Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 7, 9)>
