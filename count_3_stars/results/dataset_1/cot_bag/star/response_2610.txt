Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors - nodes 1, 2, and 7. Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
2. Node 1: Node 1 has 3 neighbors - nodes 0, 8, and 9. Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
3. Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors - nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors - nodes 1, 5, and 7. Therefore, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <7, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <8, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
