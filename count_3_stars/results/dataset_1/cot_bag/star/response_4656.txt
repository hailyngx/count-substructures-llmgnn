Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars.

Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8 have at least three neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11\)

So, the final answer is [11].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
