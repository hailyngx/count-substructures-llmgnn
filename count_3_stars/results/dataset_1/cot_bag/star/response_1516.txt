Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8.

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node:
- Node 0, 3-stars: [(0, 4, 6), (0, 5, 6)] = [2]
- Node 1, 3-stars: [(1, 2, 6), (1, 7, 3)] = [2]
- Node 2, 3-stars: [(2, 1, 6)] = [1]
- Node 3, 3-stars: [(3, 4, 6), (3, 6, 7)] = [2]
- Node 4, 3-stars: [(4, 0, 3)] = [1]
- Node 5, 3-stars: No 3-stars
- Node 6, 3-stars: [(6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 5), (6, 0, 9), (6, 2, 1), (6, 3, 7), (6, 3, 4), (6, 3, 9), (6, 7, 1), (6, 7, 3), (6, 8, 7), (6, 8, 9), (6, 9, 0), (6, 9, 3), (6, 9, 8)] = [14]
- Node 7, 3-stars: [(7, 1, 3), (7, 3, 6)] = [2]
- Node 8, 3-stars: [(8, 6, 9)] = [1]
- Node 9, 3-stars: [(9, 4, 0), (9, 4, 6), (9, 6, 0), (9, 6, 3), (9, 6, 8)] = [5]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 14 + 2 + 1 + 5] = [30]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 30.
