Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (degree 3)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 7 (degree 3)
- Node 8 (degree 3)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 12 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 7)> 

Putting the final count inside brackets gives us:

\[ [12] \]
