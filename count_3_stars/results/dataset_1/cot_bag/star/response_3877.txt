Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.

For node 0:
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.

For node 2:
- There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.

For node 7:
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 7.

For node 8:
- There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 1] = 11 \).

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (0, 7, 9)>, <0, (0, 5, 7)>, <0, (0, 4, 9)>, <0, (0, 5, 9)>, <0, (0, 7, 5)>, <0, (0, 7, 4)>, <0, (0, 4, 5)>, <0, (0, 5, 4)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
