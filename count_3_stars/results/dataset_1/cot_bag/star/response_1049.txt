Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {7}

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, which means they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So, there are [3] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
