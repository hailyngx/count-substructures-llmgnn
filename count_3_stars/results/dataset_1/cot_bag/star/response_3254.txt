Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we'll first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors (degree â‰¥ 3):
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 3)>, <3, (2, 7, 4)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 1)>, <3, (7, 9, 4)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 9, 3)>, <7, (1, 9, 4)>, <7, (1, 9, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 1, 3)>, <7, (4, 1, 6)>, <7, (4, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 2, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (7, 0, 1)>, <9, (7, 0, 3)>, <9, (7, 1, 4)>, <9, (7, 1, 6)>
