Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look at each node that has three or more neighbors. We will consider nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 since they each have at least three neighbors.

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, and 7. So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 1, there are 3 neighbors: 6, 8, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 2, there are 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 6. So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 3, there are 3 neighbors: 0, 4, and 8. So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 5, there are 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 8, there are 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 7. So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

In total, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
