Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8  
Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8  
Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 9  
Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28 \)  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<2, (4, 6, 8)>  
<2, (4, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 7, 8)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>  
<3, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (4, 7, 8)>  
<3, (6, 7, 8)>  
<4, (2, 7, 9)>  
<7, (2, 4, 5)>  
<7, (2, 4, 9)>  
<7, (2, 5, 9)>  
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
