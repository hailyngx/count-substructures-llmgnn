Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Node 1: 4

Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9

Node 3: 0, 2, 4

Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8

Node 5: 0, 2, 9

Node 6: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9

Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9

Node 8: 0, 4, 6, 7

Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Thus, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>
