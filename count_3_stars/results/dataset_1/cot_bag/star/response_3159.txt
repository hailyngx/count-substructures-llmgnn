Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed (2 neighbors).
- Node 1: No 3-star can be formed (4 neighbors).
- Node 2: C(6, 3) = 20 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed (3 neighbors).
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars can be formed.
- Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 33.

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 8)>.

So, the final result is [33].
