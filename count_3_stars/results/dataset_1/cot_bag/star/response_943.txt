Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and compute the number of 3-stars formed by each:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (Degree 4)
- Node 2 (Degree 4)
- Node 3 (Degree 3)
- Node 4 (Degree 3)
- Node 5 (Degree 4)
- Node 9 (Degree 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 34 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, we can represent the unique 3-stars as:
<[0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 5], [0, 2, 9], [0, 4, 5], [0, 4, 9], [2, 4, 7], [2, 7, 9], [2, 5, 9], [3, 5, 9], [9, 5, 1], [9, 1, 1]>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
