Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}.

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 4: There is one 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 6, 9)>

Calculating the number of 3-stars using the formula, we get:
\[ \binom{1}{3} = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found in the graph is <4, (1, 6, 9)>.
