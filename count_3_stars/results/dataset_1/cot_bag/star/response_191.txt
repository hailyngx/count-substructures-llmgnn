Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, let's analyze the nodes to identify the 3-stars.

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.
   - Number of 3-stars involving node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - 3-stars with node 0 as center: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>.

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 4.
   - Number of 3-stars involving node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - 3-star with node 1 as center: <1, (2, 3, 4)>.

3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, 0.
   - Number of 3-stars involving node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars with node 2 as center: <2, (0, 1, 4)>.

4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 6, 8.
   - Number of 3-stars involving node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars with node 3 as center: <3, (0, 6, 8)>.

5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, 8.
   - Number of 3-stars involving node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - 3-stars with node 4 as center: <4, (0, 7, 8)>.

6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors: nodes 0, 6. No 3-star is formed.

7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 5, 8.
   - Number of 3-stars involving node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - 3-stars with node 6 as center: <6, (0, 3, 8)>.

8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: nodes 4, 8, 9. No 3-star is formed.

9. Node 8 has 6 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9.
   - Number of 3-stars involving node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - 3-stars with node 8 as center: <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.

10. Node 9 has 2 neighbors: nodes 7, 8. No 3-star is formed.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated: \( 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 67 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [67].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 4)>,
<3, (0, 6, 8)>,
<4, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.
