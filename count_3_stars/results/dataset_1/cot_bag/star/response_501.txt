Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 4 -- 8
         |    |    |
         6 -- 3 -- 5
         |    |     
         7 -- 9
```

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8.  
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7.  
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8.  
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].  
The unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>.
