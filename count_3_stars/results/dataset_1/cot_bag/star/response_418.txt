Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 8}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 8}
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 2: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( {4 \choose 3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( {5 \choose 3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (1, 4, 6)> 
<2, (1, 5, 8)> 
<2, (4, 5, 8)> 
<3, (0, 5, 8)> 
<4, (2, 3, 5)> 
<4, (2, 5, 8)> 
<5, (2, 3, 4)> 
<5, (2, 4, 8)> 
<5, (3, 4, 8)> 
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
