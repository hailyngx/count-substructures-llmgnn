Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: This node has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3: This node has 1 3-star.
- Node 4: This node has 0 3-stars.
- Node 5: This node has 1 3-star.
- Node 6: This node has 1 3-star.
- Node 7: This node has 1 3-star.
- Node 8: This node has 1 3-star.
- Node 9: This node has 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives 7. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>.
