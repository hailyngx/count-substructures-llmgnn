Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Since we are looking for 3-star graphs in this network, we need to identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7)
Node 3: 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 7, 9)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
