Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- 0 is connected to 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- 1 is connected to 3 and 4.
- 2 is connected to 4, 7, and 9.
- 3 is connected to 1.
- 5 is connected to 0.
- 7 is connected to 0, 2, and 9.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <0, (4, 7, 9)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <2, (4, 7, 9)>.

Since there are only two 3-stars in this graph, the total number of 3-stars is 2.
So, the answer is [2].
