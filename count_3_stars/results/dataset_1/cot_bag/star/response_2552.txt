Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 3: connected to nodes 2, 7, and 7.
- Node 9: connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3.  
Hence, the final answer is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (0, 1, 3)>  
<3, (2, 7, 7)>  
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
