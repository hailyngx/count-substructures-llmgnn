Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
Node 3: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
Node 4: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
Node 7: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
Node 8: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 9: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 12
So, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<3, (8, 9, 4)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 4)>
<8, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 8, 4)>
