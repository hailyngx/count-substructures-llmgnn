Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are: 
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7

By applying the formula explained earlier, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 
4 (from node 0) + 0 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 5) + 0 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 9) = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 0, 3)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>
