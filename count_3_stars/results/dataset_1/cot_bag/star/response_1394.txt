Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 8.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 9.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 4)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (7, 5, 4)>
- <1, (7, 5, 6)>
- <1, (7, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 4)>
- <6, (4, 8, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 1)>
- <7, (0, 5, 4)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (3, 6, 4)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 9, 4)>
