Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each eligible node:

- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 35 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
