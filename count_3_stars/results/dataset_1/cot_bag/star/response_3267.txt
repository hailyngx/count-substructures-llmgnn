Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
1: 3
2: 4, 8
3: 1, 8
4: 2, 6, 7, 9
5: 7, 8, 9
6: 4, 7, 9
7: 4, 5, 6
8: 2, 3, 5, 9
9: 4, 5, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1: No 3-stars
Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>.
