Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed using these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 18 3-stars. Hence, the answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (4, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
