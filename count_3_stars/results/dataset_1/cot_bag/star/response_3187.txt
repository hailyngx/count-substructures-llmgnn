Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 3. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [3].
