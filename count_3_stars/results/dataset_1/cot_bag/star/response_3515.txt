Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8. 

For node 0, there are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0. 
For node 1, there are 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 1. 
For node 4, there are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 4. 
For node 8, there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 44 \).

\[ [44] \]  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>,  
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>,  
<4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>,  
<8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 9, 1)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>
