Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 4, 6
Node 1: 6
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 5: 3, 4
Node 6: 0, 1, 3
Node 8: 3, 4
Node 9: 3

Now, we will look at nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4] = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
