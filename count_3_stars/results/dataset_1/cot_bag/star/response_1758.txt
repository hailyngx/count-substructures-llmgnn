Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node. 

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 4 = 15, which can be represented as [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
