Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
We will first construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has degree 4.
- Node 5 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 3.
- Node 7 has degree 3.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it can form:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars from Node 2 are <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 3, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 5)>.
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars from Node 5 are <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 5)>.
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The unique 3-star from Node 8 is <8, (1, 2, 4)>.
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. The unique 3-star from Node 7 is <7, (1, 3, 9)>.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10 \).

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [10], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 3, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
