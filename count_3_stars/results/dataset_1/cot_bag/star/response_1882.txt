Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: neighbors 2, 8
Node 1: neighbors 6, 7
Node 2: neighbors 0, 8
Node 3: neighbors 4, 9
Node 4: neighbors 3, 5
Node 6: neighbors 1, 9
Node 7: neighbors 1, 9
Node 8: neighbors 0, 2, 9
Node 9: neighbors 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There is a total of 1+4 = 5 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7, 8)>
