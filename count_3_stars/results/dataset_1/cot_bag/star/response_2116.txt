Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph to better understand the structure:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges:   
- 0 is connected to 1 and 9  
- 1 is connected to 0  
- 3 is connected to 8 and 9  
- 4 is connected to 9  
- 5 is connected to 8 and 9  
- 6 is connected to 7  
- 7 is connected to 6, 8  
- 8 is connected to 3, 5, 7  
- 9 is connected to 0, 3, 4, 5  

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is written as [5].
