Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to check for 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 7): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 5 with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

There are no 3-stars formed for nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 10 = 18 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [18].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>,
<1, (0, 2, 5)>,
<7, (0, 5, 6)>,
<5, (0, 1, 6)>.
