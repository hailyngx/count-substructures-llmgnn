Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 11

Therefore, there are 11 [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 1)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 1)>
