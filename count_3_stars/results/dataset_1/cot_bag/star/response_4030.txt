Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has no neighbors

Therefore, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 5 and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 = 24 \). 

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
2. <5, (0, 7, 8)>
3. <5, (2, 0, 4)>
4. <5, (2, 7, 8)>
5. <5, (4, 0, 2)>
6. <5, (4, 7, 8)>
7. <5, (7, 0, 2)>
8. <5, (7, 2, 8)>
9. <5, (8, 0, 7)>
10. <5, (8, 2, 7)>
11. <7, (3, 5, 6)>
12. <7, (3, 5, 8)>
13. <7, (3, 6, 8)>
14. <7, (5, 3, 8)> 

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets: [24].
