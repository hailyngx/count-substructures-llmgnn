Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we analyze each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5, 7), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 8), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 8, 9), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 8), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 7), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 9), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
