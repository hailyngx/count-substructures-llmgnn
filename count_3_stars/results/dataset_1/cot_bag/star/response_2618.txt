Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we'll first list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: {3, 5}
Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 2: {1, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 1}
Node 4: {1}
Node 5: {0, 1, 8}
Node 6: {7, 9}
Node 7: {2, 6, 9}
Node 8: {1, 2, 5}
Node 9: {6, 7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of [14] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 0, 5)>
<1, (3, 1, 5)>
<1, (4, 1, 5)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<1, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (8, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 0)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 0)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 0)>
