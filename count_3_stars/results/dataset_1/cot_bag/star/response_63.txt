Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
   0
  / \
 5   3
     |
     7
    / \
   1   2
   |   |
   6   7
      /
     8
```

Observing the graph, we see that nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7 have 3 or more neighbours, and so they can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1]. The unique 3-star found is <7, (1, 2, 3)>.
