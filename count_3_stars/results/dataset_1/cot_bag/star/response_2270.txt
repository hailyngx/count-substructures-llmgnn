Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 1, 8
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 

Thus, we have a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>.
