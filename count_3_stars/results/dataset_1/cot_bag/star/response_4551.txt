Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \) 3-stars in total.
So, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 2, 1>
<7, 2, 5>
