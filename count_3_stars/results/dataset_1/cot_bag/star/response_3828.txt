Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26 \)

So, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
