Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 4, and 1.
- Node 4 has neighbors 3, 7, and 7.
- Node 6 has neighbors 7, 8, and 8.
- Node 7 has neighbors 4, 6, and 4.
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 5, 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1+2+3+2+3] = [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 4, 1)>
<4, (3, 7, 7)>
<4, (7, 6, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 8)>
<6, (8, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 4)>
<7, (6, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 0, 6)>
<8, (6, 0, 5)>
