Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes could potentially form 3-stars.

The degrees of the nodes in this graph are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For node 0 (degree 3):
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 7)>

For node 4 (degree 4):
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>

For node 6 (degree 5):
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 4)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 0, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 4)>, <6, (5, 0, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (7, 0, 4)>, <6, (7, 4, 9)>

For node 7 (degree 4):
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 6, 4)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 6)>, <7, (6, 0, 4)>

For node 9 (degree 6):
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 4)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 7, 6)>, <9, (2, 1, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 6)>, <9, (5, 2, 6)>, <9, (6, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20] = 39. 
The unique 3-stars formed in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 4)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 0, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 4)>, <6, (5, 0, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <6, (7, 0, 4)>, <6, (7, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 4)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 6)>, <7, (6, 0, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 4)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 7, 6)>, <9, (2, 1, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 6)>, <9, (5, 2, 6)>, <9, (6, 1, 4)>
