Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the nodes and their neighbors to find the 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, and 7. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. So, it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 4. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 8. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. So, it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 4, 6. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 2. So, it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are: 

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
