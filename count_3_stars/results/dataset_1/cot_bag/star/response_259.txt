Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 9 (degree: 3)
- Node 1: 0, 8 (degree: 2)
- Node 2: 3 (degree: 1)
- Node 3: 2 (degree: 1)
- Node 4: 6 (degree: 1)
- Node 5: 7 (degree: 1)
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8, 9 (degree: 4)
- Node 7: 5 (degree: 1)
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9 (degree: 3)
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8 (degree: 3)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
