Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
