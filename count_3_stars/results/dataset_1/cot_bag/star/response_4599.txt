Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Only connected to node 1. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0 and 9. It forms a 3-star along with nodes 0 and 9, therefore one 3-star <1, (0, 9)>.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8. It forms three 3-stars: <2, (4, 7)>, <2, (4, 8)>, and <2, (7, 8)>.
- Node 3: Connected to node 7. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2 and 5. It forms one 3-star <4, (2, 5)>.
- Node 5: Connected to node 4. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 8 and 9. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2 and 3. Not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9. It forms three 3-stars: <8, (2, 6)>, <8, (2, 9)>, and <8, (6, 9)>.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. It forms one 3-star <9, (1, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1] = 9.
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 9)>, <2, (4, 7)>, <2, (4, 8)>, <2, (7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5)>, <8, (2, 6)>, <8, (2, 9)>, <8, (6, 9)>, and <9, (1, 6)>.
