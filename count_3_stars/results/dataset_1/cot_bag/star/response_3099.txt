Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

Node 0 has neighbors: 7, 9
Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 6
Node 3 has neighbors: 5, 8
Node 4 has neighbors: 6
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 4
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 8
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1

Node 0 and Node 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.
Node 2, Node 4, and Node 6 have exactly 2 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star either.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, but it shares a neighbor with Node 8. Therefore, it can form only 1 3-star.
Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

For Node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>

For Node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<5, (1, 3, 7)>

For Node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

For Node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

Putting it all together, there are 10 total 3-stars: 1 from Node 3, 5 from Node 1, 1 from Node 5, 1 from Node 7, and 1 from Node 8.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
