Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-stars]
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: [10 3-stars]
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: [10 3-stars]
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-stars]
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [4 3-stars]
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: [10 3-stars]
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-stars]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [36 3-stars]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 8, 9)>
