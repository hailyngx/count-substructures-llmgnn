Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three neighbors each: node 0, node 1, and node 2. 
For node 0:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10 \text{ 3-stars}
\]
For node 1:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}
\]
For node 2:
\[
\binom{5}{3} = 10 \text{ 3-stars}
\]
So, there are \(10 + 4 + 10 = 24\) 3-stars in total.

Putting the final count inside brackets:
\[ [24] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>
