Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by visualizing the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1 is connected to 4, 6
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 6
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 1, 7
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 6
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 is connected to 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to 6

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph following the method mentioned earlier.

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
    - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 5)>

2. Node 1: Has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

3. Node 3: Has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

4. Node 4: Has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: 
    - <4, (0, 7, 6)>

5. Node 5: Has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

6. Node 6: Has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars:
    - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <6, (3, 5, 7)>

7. Node 7: Has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star: 
    - <7, (4, 6, 8)>

8. Node 8: Has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

9. Node 9: Has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 1 + 35 + 1 = 41, which can be represented as [41]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
