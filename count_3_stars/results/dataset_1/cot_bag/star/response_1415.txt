Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39 which gives the final answer inside brackets as [39].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
