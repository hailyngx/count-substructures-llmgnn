Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
