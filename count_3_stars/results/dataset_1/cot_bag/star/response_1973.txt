Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1+1+1] = [3] \).

The unique 3-stars found are <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, and <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
