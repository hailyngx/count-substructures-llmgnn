Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0,1), (0,7), (0,8), (1,0), (1,5), (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,8), (3,9), (4,3), (4,5), (4,7), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,3), (6,8), (6,9), (7,0), (7,4), (7,8), (8,0), (8,3), (8,6), (8,7), (8,9), (9,3), (9,6), (9,8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8 -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6 -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7 -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9 -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8 -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)> 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
