Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 55 3-stars. So, the final answer is [55].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
