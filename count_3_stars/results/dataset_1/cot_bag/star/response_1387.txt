Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first construct the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)
```

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 1 has only 1 neighbor (9), so it does not form a 3-star.

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (7, 8), so it does not form a 3-star.

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9), so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 5, 4)>, <5, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9), so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 9)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5, 9), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3), so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 3)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>


Putting everything together:
4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 26

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<5, (0, 5, 4)>, 
<5, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<5, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 5)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 5)>, 
<7, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
