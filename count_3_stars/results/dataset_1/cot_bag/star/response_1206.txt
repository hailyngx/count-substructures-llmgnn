Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the information into a clearer format. 

The graph has 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9. The edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 1.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 1, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 1, 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 1, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 3, 4, and 8.

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 5)>
- <1, (5, 2, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
