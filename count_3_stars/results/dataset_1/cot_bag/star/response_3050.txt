Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 1: 2, 6, 9  
Node 2: 1, 8, 9  
Node 3: 8  
Node 4: 5, 7  
Node 5: 4, 6, 7  
Node 6: 1, 5  
Node 7: 4, 5  
Node 8: 2, 3, 9  
Node 9: 1, 2, 8  

We can observe that only nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For node 1, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star formed: <1, 2, 6, 9>  
For node 2, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star formed: <2, 1, 8, 9>  
For node 5, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star formed: <5, 4, 6, 7>  
For node 9, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star formed: <9, 1, 2, 8>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] in this graph is 4.  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, 2, 6, 9>, <2, 1, 8, 9>, <5, 4, 6, 7>, and <9, 1, 2, 8>.
