Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 45 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>

- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 9, 5)>
- <0, (6, 9, 5)>
- <0, (6, 9, 7)>
- <0, (7, 9, 4)>
- <0, (7, 9, 5)>
- <0, (7, 4, 5)>
- <0, (9, 7, 5)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 4, 7)>
- <9, (5, 4, 6)>
- <9, (7, 6, 4)>
