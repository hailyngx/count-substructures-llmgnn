Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 3)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Summing these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
