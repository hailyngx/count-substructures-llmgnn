Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and then calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 0 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 9)
  Number of 3-stars with Node 0 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 3: 3 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8, 1)
  Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 1)>, <3, (1, 8, 5)>, <3, (2, 8, 5)>, <3, (2, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 2)>

- Node 4: 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 5)
  Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center = 1
  <4, (0, 5, 5)>

- Node 5: 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9)
  Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>

- Node 9: 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 5)
  Number of 3-stars with Node 9 as the center = 1
  <9, (0, 5, 5)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node:
\( [4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [20] \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>,
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 1)>, <3, (1, 8, 5)>, <3, (2, 8, 5)>, <3, (2, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 2)>,
<4, (0, 5, 5)>,
<5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>,
<9, (0, 5, 5)>
