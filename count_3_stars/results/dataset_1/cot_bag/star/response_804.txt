Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 7): 
   - There is 1 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4): 
   - There is 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8): 
   - There is 1 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4): 
   - There is 1 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2): 
   - There is 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 8, 9): 
   - There are 6 3-stars: <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 6)>, <7, (5, 8, 6)>
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 9): 
   - There are 6 3-stars: <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (6, 7, 5)>
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (8, 9): 
   - No 3-stars can be formed.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors (6, 7): 
   - No 3-stars can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 6] = 17. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 6)>, <7, (5, 8, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (6, 7, 5)>.
