Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
We start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the list of edges given, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [4 + 1 + 1 = 6].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 4, 9)>

So, the final answer is [6].
