Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {3}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up: [1 + 4 + 10 + 10] = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 25.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>
