Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are labeled as follows:
Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Let's first create the graph visually based on the given edges:
      
                            1 --- 7 
                            |     | \ 
                            |     |  2
                            3 --- 6  |
                            | /   |  |
                            4 --- 9--5
                            | \
                            8
                            |
                            10

Now let's analyze the nodes to find the 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 9 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{9}{3} = 84 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these together, we get a total of \( 84 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 4 = 137 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [137].
The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
