Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors
- Node 5: has 1 neighbor
- Node 6: has 3 neighbors
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 9, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
