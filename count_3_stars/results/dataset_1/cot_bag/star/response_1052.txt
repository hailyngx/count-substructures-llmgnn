Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

For node 0:
There are 5 edges connected to node 0. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 2:
There are 3 edges connected to node 2. Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 4:
There are 6 edges connected to node 4. Therefore, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center:
<4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
There are 4 edges connected to node 6. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
<6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
There are 5 edges connected to node 7. Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
<7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 9:
There are 4 edges connected to node 9. Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
<9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 49\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].
