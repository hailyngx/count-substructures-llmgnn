Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges:

```
   0 -- 4 -- 7
   |    |    
   4 -- 2 -- 9
   |    |    
   3 -- 1 -- 8  
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and find the 3-stars associated with each of them:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 8, 9, 3
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9

For Node 2:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 2 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
  - <2, (4, 3, 1)>
  - <2, (4, 3, 7)>
  - <2, (8, 3, 1)>

For Node 4:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
  - <4, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 2, 3)>
  - <4, (4, 7, 2)>
  - <4, (4, 3, 7)>

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star is formed with Node 8.
- Unique 3-star: 
  - <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = 9.  
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 3, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 3)>, <2, (8, 3, 1)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (4, 7, 2)>, <4, (4, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
