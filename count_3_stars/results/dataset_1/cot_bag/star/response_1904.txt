Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star per node
For node 4 with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6 with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 6)>
