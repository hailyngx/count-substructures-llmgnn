Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Therefore, there is one 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 7, 8)>.

For node 2: 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Therefore, there is one 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 3, 4)>.

For node 4: 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 
  <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, we have [6] 3-stars in total, which are: 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>.
