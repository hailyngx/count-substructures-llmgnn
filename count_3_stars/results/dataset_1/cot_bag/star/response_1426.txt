Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then count the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    - <0, (5, 3, 6)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <2, (0, 3, 7)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <5, (0, 3, 6)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <7, (2, 3, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 4)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 4)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 15
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
