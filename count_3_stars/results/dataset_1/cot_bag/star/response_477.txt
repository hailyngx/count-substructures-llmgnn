Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes. 

The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 2, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 4 + 0 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
