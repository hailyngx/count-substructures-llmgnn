Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 : 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 1 : 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7)
- Node 2 : 2 neighbors (6, 8)
- Node 3 : 2 neighbors (1, 9)
- Node 4 : 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 5 : 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9)
- Node 6 : 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 7 : 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 8 : 2 neighbors (2, 6)
- Node 9 : 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 10 + 1] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 3, 7)> 
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
