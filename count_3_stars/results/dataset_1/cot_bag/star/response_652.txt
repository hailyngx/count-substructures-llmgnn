Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
