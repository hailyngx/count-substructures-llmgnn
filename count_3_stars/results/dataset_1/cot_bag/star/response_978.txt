Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's represent the connections visually to better understand the graph:

```
0 --- 1     8     9
|               
|               
1 --- 0               
|
|
4 --------- 7     
|
|
5 --- 6     7    
|               
|               
6 --- 5     9    
|
|
7 --------- 4
```

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (1, 8, 9)>

Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 0
- No 3-star can be formed with node 1.

Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 7
- No 3-star can be formed with node 4.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7
- No 3-star can be formed with node 5.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- No 3-star can be formed with node 6.

Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5
- No 3-star can be formed with node 7.

Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 0
- No 3-star can be formed with node 8.

Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- No 3-star can be formed with node 9.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1. Thus, the answer is [1].
