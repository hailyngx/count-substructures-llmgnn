Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine how many neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only one 3-star with node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (Ten 3-stars with node 2: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (Ten 3-stars with node 3: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Four 3-stars with node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Four 3-stars with node 5: <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Four 3-stars with node 6: <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Four 3-stars with node 7: <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>)

The total number of 3-stars is 27. So, the final answer is [27].
