Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].
