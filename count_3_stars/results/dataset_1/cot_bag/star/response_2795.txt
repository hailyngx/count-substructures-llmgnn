Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will consider each node with 3 or more neighbors. 

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 1: 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 2: 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, and 7. 
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
  <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 7)>.

For node 3: 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, and 9. 
- There is only 1 way to choose 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center:
  <3, (5, 8, 9)>.

For node 4: 
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 5: 
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 7. 
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors, so there are 20 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
  <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>,
  <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, and their symmetric combinations.

For node 6: 
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, and 9. 
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
  <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.

For node 7: 
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 6. 
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors, so there are 20 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
  <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>,
  <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, and their symmetric combinations.

For node 8: 
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 9: 
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 6. 
- There is only 1 way to choose 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center:
  <9, (0, 3, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is the sum of the individual counts: 4 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 20 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) + 20 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 9) = 50.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50]. The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>.
