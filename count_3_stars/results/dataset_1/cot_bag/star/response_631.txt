Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

\[ \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 13 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ [13] \]

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 9, 8)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
