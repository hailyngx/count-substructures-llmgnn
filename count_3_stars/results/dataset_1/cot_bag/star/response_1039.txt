Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the provided information, we can construct the graph as follows: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Forms 1 3-star <0, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 3: Forms 1 3-star <3, (0, 2, 6)>
Node 4: Forms 3 3-stars <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, and <4, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 6: Forms 3 3-stars <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, and <6, (4, 5, 7)>
Node 7: Forms 1 3-star <7, (0, 4, 8)>
Node 8: Forms 1 3-star <8, (0, 4, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1] = [10]

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
