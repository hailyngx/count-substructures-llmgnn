Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 7 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 35 = 49

So, the final answer is [49].
