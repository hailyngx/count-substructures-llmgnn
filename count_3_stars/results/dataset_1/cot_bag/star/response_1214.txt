Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

-- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 9.
-- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7.
-- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 9.
-- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
-- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 9.
-- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
-- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
-- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
-- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
-- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
