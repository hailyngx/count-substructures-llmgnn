Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with more than 3 neighbors: node 0 and node 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 4: <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 = 14
So, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>.
