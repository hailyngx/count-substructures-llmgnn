Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes connected to each other:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 4: Connected to node 3
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5 and 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 15 \).

So, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
