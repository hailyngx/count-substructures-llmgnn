Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can construct the following visualization:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16, so the final answer is  [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (8, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (8, 3, 9)>
