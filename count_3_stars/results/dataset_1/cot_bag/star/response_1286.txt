Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors.

Observing the list of edges, we see that the nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (5, 6)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 7)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (1, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (0, 7)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 29 3-stars [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
