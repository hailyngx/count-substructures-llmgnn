Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 9)
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3)
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7)
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6)
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (0, 3)
Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7)
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8)

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 1: 1 3-star
<1, (0, 2, 3)>

Node 2: 1 3-star
<2, (1, 6, 7)>

Node 3: 1 3-star
<3, (1, 4, 6)>

Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>

Adding all the 3-stars gives us a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
