Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8)
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star 
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star 
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star 
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star 
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star 
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars 

Adding these up, there are total [9] 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>.
