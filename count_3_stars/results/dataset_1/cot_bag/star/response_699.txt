Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
0 --- 9
  \      
   3    
         
2 - 6 - 5
|     |  
8     9  
|     |  
7     4
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9: Forms 3 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 3] = [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
