Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph to visualize it:

                                                      0
                                                     / \
                                                    /   \
                                                   9-----6-----8
                                                        /|\
                                                       / | \
                                                      5--3--7
                                                       \ | /
                                                        \|/
                                                        1
                                                         \
                                                          4
                                                          
Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 3, 4, 5, and 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 6, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 2, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 3, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 1 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges is [13].
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>.
