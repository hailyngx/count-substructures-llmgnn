Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7  
Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9  
Node 2: 0  
Node 3: 5, 9  
Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 8  
Node 5: 0, 3, 6  
Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9  
Node 7: 0, 4, 9  
Node 8: 1, 4  
Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7  

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 2, 5)>  
<1, (0, 4, 6)>  
<1, (4, 6, 9)>  
<1, (4, 7, 9)>  
<1, (6, 4, 5)>  
<1, (6, 4, 9)>  
<1, (6, 5, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>  
<6, (1, 4, 5)>  
<6, (1, 4, 9)>  
<6, (1, 5, 9)>  
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
