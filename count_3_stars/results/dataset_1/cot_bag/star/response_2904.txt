Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
<0, (3, 5, 8)>,  <0, (3, 5, 9)>,  <0, (3, 8, 9)>,  <0, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 1, there are 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, and 9. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
<1, (3, 6, 8)>,  <1, (3, 6, 9)>,  <1, (3, 8, 9)>,  <1, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 3, there are 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9, and 6. There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
<3, (0, 1, 4)>,  <3, (0, 1, 9)>,  <3, (0, 1, 6)>,  <3, (0, 4, 9)>,  <3, (0, 4, 6)>,  
<3, (0, 9, 6)>,  <3, (1, 4, 9)>,  <3, (1, 4, 6)>,  <3, (1, 9, 6)>,  <3, (4, 9, 6)>

For node 6, there are 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 8. There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
<6, (1, 2, 4)>,  <6, (1, 2, 5)>,  <6, (1, 2, 9)>,  <6, (1, 2, 8)>,  <6, (1, 4, 5)>,  
<6, (1, 4, 9)>,  <6, (1, 4, 8)>,  <6, (1, 5, 9)>,  <6, (1, 5, 8)>,  <6, (1, 9, 8)>,  
<6, (2, 4, 5)>,  <6, (2, 4, 9)>,  <6, (2, 4, 8)>,  <6, (2, 5, 9)>,  <6, (2, 5, 8)>,  
<6, (2, 9, 8)>,  <6, (4, 5, 9)>,  <6, (4, 5, 8)>,  <6, (4, 9, 8)>,  <6, (5, 9, 8)>

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, and 9. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
<8, (0, 1, 2)>,  <8, (0, 1, 9)>,  <8, (0, 2, 9)>,  <8, (1, 2, 9)>

For node 9, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, and 6. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
<9, (0, 1, 3)>,  <9, (0, 1, 6)>,  <9, (0, 3, 6)>,  <9, (1, 3, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 46 \).
