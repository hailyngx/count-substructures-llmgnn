Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7)
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (2, 9)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (1, 5)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (6, 8)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 1)

Applying the formula, we get: 
\[ \binom{4}{3}  + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \]

\[ = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 \]
\[ = 12 \]

So, there are a total of 12 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars we find: 

\[ [12] \]
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
