Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with its neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8 forms 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>.
