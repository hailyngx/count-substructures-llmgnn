Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 and Node 5 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.
- Node 4 and Node 9 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars each.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13. 

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 1)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 8, 5)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
