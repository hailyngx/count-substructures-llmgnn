Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} =1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 25 \).

So, the final answer is [25].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
