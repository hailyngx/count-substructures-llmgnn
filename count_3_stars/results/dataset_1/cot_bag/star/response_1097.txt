Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 1.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.

To find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (3, 9).
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (4).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9).
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor (1).
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (2).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (8, 9).
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (2, 3).
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2, 6).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 6).

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0 and 9: [inom{2}{3}] + [inom{3}{3}] = 0 + 1 = 1
- For node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For nodes 3 and 6: [inom{3}{3}] + [inom{2}{3}] = 1 + 0 = 1
- The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1] = 3

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, and <6, (8, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
