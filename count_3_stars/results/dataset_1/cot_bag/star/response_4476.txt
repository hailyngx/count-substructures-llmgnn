Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

0: 8

1: 3, 7, 8

2: 9

3: 1

4: 5, 6

5: 4

6: 4

7: 1, 8

8: 0, 1, 7

9: 2

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
