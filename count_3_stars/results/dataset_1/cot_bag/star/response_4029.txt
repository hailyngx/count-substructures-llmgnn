Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.   

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 53

In brackets: [53]

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>
