Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are:
- Node 2 with neighbors 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 4 with neighbors 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 6 with neighbors 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8 with neighbors 4, 5, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>

<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (6, 8, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
