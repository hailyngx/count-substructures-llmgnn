Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
With 10 nodes, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these central nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 4, 6)>
- <0, (6, 0, 7)>
- <3, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (4, 3, 9)>
- <4, (3, 4, 6)>
- <4, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (6, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 6, 4)>
- <6, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 9, 5)>
- <9, (1, 9, 4)>
- <9, (1, 9, 6)>
- <9, (5, 9, 4)>
- <9, (5, 9, 6)>
- <9, (4, 9, 6)>
