Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {1}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
<0, (3, 6)>

Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
<1, (7, 9)>

Node 2 can form 3-stars.
<2, (4, 6)>
<2, (6, 4)>

Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
<3, (0, 6)>

Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
<4, (2, 8)>

Node 6 can form 3-stars.
<6, (0, 3)>
<6, (2, 4)>
<6, (3, 0)>

There are a total of 7 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [7].
