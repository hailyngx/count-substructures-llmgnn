Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 3, 6, 8  
Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 8  
Node 2: 1, 8, 9  
Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9  
Node 4: 3  
Node 5: 3, 6  
Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 9  
Node 7: 1, 3  
Node 8: 0, 1, 2  
Node 9: 2, 3, 6 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get:  
\[ [1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [22] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 22.  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<1, (2, 6, 7)>  
<1, (2, 6, 8)>  
<1, (2, 7, 8)>  
<1, (6, 7, 8)>  
<3, (0, 5, 7)>  
<3, (0, 6, 9)>  
<3, (4, 5, 6)>  
<3, (5, 6, 9)>  
<6, (0, 1, 9)>  
<6, (1, 5, 9)>  
<6, (1, 6, 9)>  
<6, (5, 6, 9)>
