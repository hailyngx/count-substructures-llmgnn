Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 20 + 1 + 4] = 26.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
