Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first construct the graph and then identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes of the graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges of the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to node 0
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 7
- Node 5 is connected to node 2
- Node 6 is connected to node 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 7)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (6, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
