Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0] = 19 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the answer is: 
\[ 19 \text{ [ <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>] \]
