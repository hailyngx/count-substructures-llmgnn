Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 1, 3, and 4 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 39 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 1, 9)>, <0, (5, 1, 4)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (9, 1, 5)>,
<8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 7)>, <8, (7, 6, 9)>, <8, (9, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 7, 6)>,
<9, (0, 4, 1)>, <9, (0, 5, 1)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (3, 1, 6)>, <9, (4, 0, 1)>,
<1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 0, 9)>, <1, (5, 0, 4)>, <1, (9, 0, 5)>,
<6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 3, 9)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>,
<4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 0, 9)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>,
<3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (9, 1, 6)>
