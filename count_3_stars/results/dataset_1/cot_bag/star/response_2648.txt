Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {6}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \(\binom{1}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) <4, (6, 3, 0)>
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) <6, (3, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 0, 8)>
- Node 7: \(\binom{1}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \(\binom{1}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \([0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0] = 9\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 3, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 0, 8)>.
