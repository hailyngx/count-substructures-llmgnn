Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15 \) which gives us the final count inside brackets: [15]. 

The unique 3-stars formed are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 8)>
