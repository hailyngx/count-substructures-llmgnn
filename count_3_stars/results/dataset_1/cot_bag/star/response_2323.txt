Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 2 neighbors.  
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 23 \)  
So, the final answer is [23].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<2, (3, 2, 4)>  
<2, (3, 2, 8)>  
<2, (3, 4, 8)>  
<2, (6, 3, 8)>  
<3, (2, 4, 8)>  
<4, (1, 2, 4)>  
<4, (1, 4, 7)>  
<4, (1, 4, 8)>  
<4, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (0, 1, 6)>  
<6, (0, 3, 6)>  
<6, (1, 3, 6)>  
<6, (3, 6, 7)>  
<8, (0, 2, 8)>  
<8, (2, 4, 8)>  
<8, (2, 8, 9)>  
<8, (3, 4, 8)>  
<8, (3, 8, 9)>  
<8, (4, 8, 9)>  
<8, (8, 9, 2)>  
<8, (8, 9, 3)>  
<8, (8, 9, 4)>
