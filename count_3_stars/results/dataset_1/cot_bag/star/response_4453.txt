Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Let's list the nodes with their neighbors first:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7, 8

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [10] \]

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
