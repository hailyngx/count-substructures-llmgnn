Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0,5), (0,9), (1,3), (1,5), (2,6), (2,9), (3,1), (3,4), (4,3), (4,5), (4,6), (4,9), (5,0), (5,1), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8), (6,2), (6,4), (6,5), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,0), (9,2), (9,4)

Now, we determine the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 4, 5, 6, 9

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22], and the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (3, 9, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (5, 1, 4)>, <5, (5, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (6, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>
