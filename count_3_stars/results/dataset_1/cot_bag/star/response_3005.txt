Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, and 3. 

For node 0, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
For node 2, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
For node 4, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
For node 6, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
For node 3, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 61 \).

So, there are 61 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here they are listed once each:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>.
