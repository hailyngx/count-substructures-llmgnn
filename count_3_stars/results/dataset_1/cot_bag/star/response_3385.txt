Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the provided edges:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 25

Thus, there are 25 total 3-stars in the graph: [25]
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>
