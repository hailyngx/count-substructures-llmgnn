Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 7}

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars formed using the above nodes:
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
