Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars and list them:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [8].
