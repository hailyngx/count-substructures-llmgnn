Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 3, 4, and 9. 

Calculating the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13.

Therefore, we have 13 3-stars in total, which can be listed as follows (inside <>):
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>.

So the final result is [13].
