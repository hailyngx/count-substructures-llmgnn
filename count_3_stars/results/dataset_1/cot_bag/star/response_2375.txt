Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 21 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 7)>
<0, (9, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (7, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 2)>
