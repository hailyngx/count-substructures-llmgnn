Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 5, 7)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 4, 8)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 8, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 3)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 3, 8)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 2, 4, 7)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

The total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
