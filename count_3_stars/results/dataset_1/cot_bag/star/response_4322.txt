Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 45

So, there are 45 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)> 
- <7, (0, 2, 4)> 
- <7, (3, 4, 8)> 

Putting the final count in brackets: [45]
