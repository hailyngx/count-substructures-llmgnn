Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with 10 nodes and the given 20 edges:

```
          1
          |
          2 -- 7
         /|\   |
        3  |   |
        |  |   |
        |  |   5
        |  |  /
        4--6--8
         \ |
          9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 5
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 8

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 2 can form 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, 3, 5>
- <3, 2, 4>
- <4, 3, 5>
- <5, 3, 7>
- <8, 4, 6>
