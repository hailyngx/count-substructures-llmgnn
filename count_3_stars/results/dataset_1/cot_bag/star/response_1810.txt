Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can identify the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 5
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 0, 5, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 9
Node 6: 3, 5
Node 7: 2, 3, 8
Node 8: 7
Node 9: 5

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: [1]
- For Node 2: [1]
- For Node 3: [3]
- For Node 5: [3]
- For Node 7: [1]

Summing these up, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 0, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
