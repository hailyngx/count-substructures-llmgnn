Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 7}
Number of 3-stars with Node 1 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (0, 5, 7)>

Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {5, 9} - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 8}
Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 4}
Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {3, 7, 9}
Number of 3-stars with Node 6 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<6, (3, 7, 9)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {1, 3, 6}
Number of 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<7, (1, 3, 6)>

Node 8 has 1 neighbor: {4} - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {2, 3, 6}
Number of 3-stars with Node 9 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Total number of unique 3-stars: 10
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
