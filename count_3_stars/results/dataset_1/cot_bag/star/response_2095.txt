Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
