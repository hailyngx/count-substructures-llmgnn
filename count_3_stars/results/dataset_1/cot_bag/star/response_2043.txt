Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll draw the graph to visualize it:

```
    1 -- 2           4
    |  /             |
    | /              |
    6 -- 7 -- 0 -- 3
    |    |  
    5 -- 8           
         |
         9
```

From the graph, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8 are the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [33].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 0)>
- <1, (6, 8, 7)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 5)>
- <6, (8, 7, 0)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 8, 0)>
- <7, (6, 8, 0)>
- <8, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (7, 6, 1)>
- <8, (7, 0, 3)>
- <8, (7, 1, 6)>
- <8, (7, 1, 0)>
- <8, (7, 6, 0)>
- <8, (7, 0, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 0)>
- <8, (8, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
