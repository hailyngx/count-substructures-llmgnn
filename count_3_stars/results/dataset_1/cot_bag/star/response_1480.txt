Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {6}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 38 3-stars in this graph.
Inside brackets: [38]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>
