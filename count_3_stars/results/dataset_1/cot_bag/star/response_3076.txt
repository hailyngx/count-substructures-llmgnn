Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
