Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
In this graph, there are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 \).

Putting this final count inside brackets, we get [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (9, 7, 1)>
