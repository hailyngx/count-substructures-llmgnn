Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
We'll analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 1, 3

Let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star. 
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

So, there is 1 unique 3-star in this graph: <4, (0, 5, 6)>.

Putting this final count inside brackets: [1].
