Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the nodes that are connected to three or more other nodes. Then, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed using that node as the center.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For node 0:
Number of unique 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>

For node 1:
Number of unique 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 2:
Number of unique 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>

For node 3:
Number of unique 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 3: <3, (0, 2, 6)>

For node 4:
Number of unique 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of unique 3-stars: \( [10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 16.
