Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 29 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this number inside brackets gives us [29].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
