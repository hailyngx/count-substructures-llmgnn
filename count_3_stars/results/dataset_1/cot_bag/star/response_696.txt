Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The list of nodes with their respective neighbors is as follows:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 2: neighbor {4}
- Node 3: neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 8: neighbor {5}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 6}

Based on the information above, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 does not have more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 does not have more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 does not have more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 does not have more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 7 does not have more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 does not have more than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 does not have more than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 1] = 15.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
