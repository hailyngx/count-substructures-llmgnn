Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes potentially form the center of a 3-star. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 (neighbors: 3, 4, 9)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 6, 7)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 2, 4, 7)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 2, 5, 6)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1] = [14] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
