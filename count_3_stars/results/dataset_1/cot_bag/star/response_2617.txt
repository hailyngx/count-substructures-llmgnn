Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9). So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

- Node 1: Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8). So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

- Node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6). So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 2 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

- Node 3: Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4). So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 3 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

- Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3). So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 4 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

- Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7). So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 5 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

- Node 7: Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 9). So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 7 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

- Node 8: Node 8 has 2 neighbors (0, 1). As it does not have at least 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 8.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [10] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 5)>.
