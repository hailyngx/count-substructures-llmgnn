Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we'll first represent the graph in adjacency list format based on the given edges:

0: [1, 3, 5, 6]
1: [0, 5, 6]
2: [6, 8]
3: [0]
4: [5, 8, 9]
5: [0, 1, 4, 7, 9]
6: [0, 1, 2, 7]
7: [5, 6]
8: [2, 4]
9: [4, 5]

We see that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6 have three or more neighbors, allowing for the formation of 3-stars. Node 5 has exactly 3 neighbors, while the others have more. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 1: 1
- For node 5: 1
- For node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars. 

Therefore, inside brackets [], we have [10].  
The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<0, (5, 6, 7)>  
<0, (5, 6, 1)>  
<1, (5, 4, 6)>  
<5, (7, 6, 0)>  
<5, (7, 6, 1)>  
<5, (9, 4, 0)>  
<6, (1, 0, 5)>  
<6, (2, 8, 4)>
