Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6), so there are 1 3-star(s) with node 0 as the center. 
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 7, 8), so there are 10 3-star(s) with node 2 as the center. 
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star. 
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star. 
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7), so there are 1 3-star(s) with node 6 as the center. 
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star. 
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 1] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>.
