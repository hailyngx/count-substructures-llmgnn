Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, and 8.  
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 

So, the final answer is [40].  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 0, 7)>
<3, (8, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 0, 9)>
<4, (8, 0, 3)>
<4, (8, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
