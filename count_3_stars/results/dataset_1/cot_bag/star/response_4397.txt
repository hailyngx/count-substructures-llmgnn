Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:  
Node 0: 7, 8, 9  
Node 1: 2, 7, 9  
Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 9  
Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 8  
Node 4: 6, 8  
Node 5: 7, 9  
Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8  
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6  
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9  
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8  â€‹

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars  
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 54  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [54].  

Unique 3-stars formed are:
