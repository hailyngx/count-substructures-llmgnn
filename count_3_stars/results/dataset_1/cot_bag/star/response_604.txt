Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it forms () = 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms () = 4 3-stars.
- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 20 + 4 = 25.

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we get [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
