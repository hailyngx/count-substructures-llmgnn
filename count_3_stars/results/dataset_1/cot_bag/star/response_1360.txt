Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 30 edges in this graph. Let's analyze each node to see which nodes it's connected to:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 1: Connected to node 2
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to node 0
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 6 and 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4 and 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding all the possibilities together: 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>
