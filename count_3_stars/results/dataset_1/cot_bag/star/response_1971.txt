Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 9, 1, 8, 5.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19.

Therefore, the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 9, 6)>
