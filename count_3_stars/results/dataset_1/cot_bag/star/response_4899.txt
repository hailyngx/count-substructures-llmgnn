Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes have the following connections:

Node 0: 3, 8
Node 1: 6, 7
Node 2: 4, 9
Node 3: 0, 4, 8
Node 4: 2, 3, 5
Node 5: 4, 9
Node 6: 1, 8
Node 7: 1, 9
Node 8: 0, 3, 6
Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Now, we will determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

For Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 
For Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
For Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
