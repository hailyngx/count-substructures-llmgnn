Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 3, 4, 6, 9
- 1 is connected to 3, 7
- 2 is connected to 8, 9
- 3 is connected to 0, 1, 5
- 4 is connected to 0, 5, 7
- 5 is connected to 3, 4, 8, 9
- 6 is connected to 0
- 7 is connected to 1, 4
- 8 is connected to 2, 5, 9
- 9 is connected to 0, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, it can participate in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
    - <0, (3, 4, 6)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 3: Node 3 also has 4 neighbors, so it can participate in 4 3-stars.
    - <3, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 1, 4)>

- Node 5: Node 5 has 4 neighbors and can participate in 4 3-stars.
    - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <5, (3, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 4, 9)>

Adding these up, we have a total of \(4 + 4 + 4 = 12\) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
