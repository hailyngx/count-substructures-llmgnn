Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 4 has the neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 6 has the neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 9 has the neighbors: 4, 6, 8

For Node 4:
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars formed by Node 4.

For Node 6:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars formed by Node 6.

For Node 9:
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star formed by Node 9.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 6) + 1 (from Node 9) = 25

So, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:

<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
