Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned before:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a result of [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, and <5, (4, 8, 9)>.
