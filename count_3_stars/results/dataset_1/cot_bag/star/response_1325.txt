Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

For Node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 4)>

For Node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 9)>

For Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 6, 9)>

For Node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
<9, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (2, 1, 5)>, 
<9, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (4, 1, 5)>, 
<9, (4, 6, 9)> 

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 = 38
Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [38]. 

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<1, (2, 5, 4)>,
<2, (1, 5, 9)>,
<4, (1, 6, 9)>,
<9, (0, 2, 8)>,
<9, (0, 3, 6)>,
<9, (0, 4, 8)>,
<9, (0, 6, 8)>,
<9, (1, 2, 4)>,
<9, (1, 2, 5)>,
<9, (1, 4, 6)>,
<9, (2, 1, 5)>,
<9, (2, 5, 9)>,
<9, (4, 1, 5)>,
<9, (4, 6, 9)>.
