Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
