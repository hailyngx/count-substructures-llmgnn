Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first lay out the nodes and their connections based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 6, 7, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to Node 0
- Node 3 is connected to Node 6
- Node 5 is connected to Node 6
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 5
- Node 7 is connected to Node 1
- Node 8 is connected to Node 9
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: Node 1, Node 6, and Node 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
