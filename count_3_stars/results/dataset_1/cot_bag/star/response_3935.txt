Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 8. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 forms $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 forms $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 forms $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is $1 + 4 + 1 = 6$, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>.

So the final answer is [6].
