Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Considering the nodes with three or more neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9), we count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up gives a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 16 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 2)>.
