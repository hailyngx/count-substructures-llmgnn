Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered 0 through 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, and 6.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 4.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, and 8.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 6.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 5, 6.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 9.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 8.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 23 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>.
