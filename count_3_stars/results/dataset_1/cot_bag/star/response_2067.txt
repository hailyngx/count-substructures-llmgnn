Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
  - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
  - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
  - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
  - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
  - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
  - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
  - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
  - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
  - Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Now, we'll identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8. So, we have one 3-star.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5. So, we have another 3-star.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7. So, we have one more 3-star.

Putting this information together, we have a total of [3] 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
