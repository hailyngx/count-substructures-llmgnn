Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5.
- Node 0 and Node 2 have less than 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 0 = 25

So, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>
