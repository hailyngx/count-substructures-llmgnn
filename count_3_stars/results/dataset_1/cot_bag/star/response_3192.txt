Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first organize the nodes based on their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to node 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7.

Now, let's identify how many 3-stars each node can form:

- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Nodes 0, 7, 9 have less than 3 neighbors and therefore cannot form any 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 14 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
