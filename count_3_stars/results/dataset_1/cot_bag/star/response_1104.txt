Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [4 + 10 + 4] = [18] 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>.
