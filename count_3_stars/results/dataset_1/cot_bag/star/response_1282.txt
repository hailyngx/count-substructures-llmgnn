Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
