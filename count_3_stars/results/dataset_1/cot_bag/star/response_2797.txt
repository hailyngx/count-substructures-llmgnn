Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
No 3-star can be formed as it has only 2 neighbors.

For node 2:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars can be formed:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 5)>, <2, (8, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors.

For node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars can be formed:
<8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4] = 14.
