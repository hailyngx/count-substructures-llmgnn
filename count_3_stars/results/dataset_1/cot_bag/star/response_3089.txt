Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [23] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
