Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's go through the nodes to identify which ones have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Only Node 6 has more than three neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars for this node:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
