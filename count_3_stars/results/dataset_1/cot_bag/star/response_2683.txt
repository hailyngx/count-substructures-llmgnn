Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are specified. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph: 

- Node 1: has neighbors 6 and 9
- Node 2: has neighbors 0, 8, and 9
- Node 3: has neighbors 7 and 8
- Node 4: has neighbor 5
- Node 6: has neighbors 1, 8, and 9
- Node 7: has neighbors 3, 4, and 9
- Node 8: has neighbors 2, 3, and 6
- Node 9: has neighbors 1, 2, 6, and 7

Now, we will count the 3-stars:

- Node 1: 1 (with nodes 6 and 9)
- Node 2: 3 (with nodes 0, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 1 (with nodes 7 and 8)

No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (6, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8)>
