Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 7)}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 20 \)

So, there are 20 3-stars in the given graph. Listing them in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
