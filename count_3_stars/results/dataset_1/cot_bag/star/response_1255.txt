Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-stars with node 0 as center: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  3-stars with node 2 as center have various combinations.

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars with node 7 as center: <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 2)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 7)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <7, (6, 9, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars with node 9 as center: <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>

There are no 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 as centers since they have less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 (from node 0) + 20 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 9) = 44.

Thus, the final result is [44].
