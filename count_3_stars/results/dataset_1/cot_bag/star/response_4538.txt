Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the calculation for the 3-stars in the graph:  
- Node 0: has neighbors [2, 6, 7, 9], so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 1: has neighbors [3, 4], so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2: has neighbors [0, 8, 9], so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: has neighbors [1, 5, 9], so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: has neighbors [1, 5, 8], so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: has neighbors [3, 4, 6, 8], so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6: has neighbors [0, 5, 8], so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: has neighbors [0, 8, 9], so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: has neighbors [2, 4, 5, 6, 7], so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 9: has neighbors [0, 2, 3, 7], so it forms 1 3-star.

In total, there are 25 3-stars in the graph [<0, (2, 6, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9, 4)>, <3, (9, 1, 5, 3)>, <4, (8, 5, 1, 4)>, <5, (3, 8, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 8, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 8, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 8, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 8, 5, 2)>, <7, (8, 0, 9, 2)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 4, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7, 3)>].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
