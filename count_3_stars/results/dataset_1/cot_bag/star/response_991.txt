Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph, and they are as follows:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
