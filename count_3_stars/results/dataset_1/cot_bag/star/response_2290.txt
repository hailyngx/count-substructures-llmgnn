Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.

The graph consists of the following nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 3, Node 4, and Node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 2, Node 6, and Node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 0, Node 2, and Node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph using the process explained earlier.

For each node that has at least 3 neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it forms:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these together: [4]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
