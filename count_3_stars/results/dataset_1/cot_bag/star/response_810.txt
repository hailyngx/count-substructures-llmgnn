Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 3: neighbor {8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 4, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>
