Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 6, 7
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 11 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 8, 9)>
