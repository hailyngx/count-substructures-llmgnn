Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7

Now, we can calculate how many 3-stars can be formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 2, 4)>
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 8, 1)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 0, 7)>
- <5, (1, 8, 7)>
- <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 0)>
