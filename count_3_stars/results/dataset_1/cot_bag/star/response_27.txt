Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their connections are as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8.
Node 7 is connected to node 9.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (6, 2, 9)>, <1, (8, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
