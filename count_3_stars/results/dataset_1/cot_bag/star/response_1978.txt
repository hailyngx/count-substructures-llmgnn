Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors and find the 3-stars in the graph.
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.

For node 0:
It has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 8), so we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 0. These are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 1:
It has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7), so only 1 3-star can be formed with node 1. This is:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 3:
It has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9), so we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 3. These are:
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
It has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5), so only 1 3-star can be formed with node 4. This is:
<4, (1, 3, 5)>

For node 5:
It has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9), so only 1 3-star can be formed with node 5. This is:
<5, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5), so we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 7. These are:
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
