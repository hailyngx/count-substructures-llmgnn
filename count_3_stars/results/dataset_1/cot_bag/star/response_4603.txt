Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 5)
```

Now, we will find the 3-stars in this graph and then count them:
1. Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8) so it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5) so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6) so it forms 1 3-star.
4. Node 4: It has 2 neighbors (0, 2) so no 3-star is formed.
5. Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8) so it forms 1 3-star.
6. Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (3, 7) so no 3-star is formed.
7. Node 8: It has 2 neighbors (0, 5) so no 3-star is formed.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 5) = 7

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>
