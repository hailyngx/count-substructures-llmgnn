Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 8), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 2), (8, 4), (9, 3)

Next, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

For Node 0:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 2:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 4:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).

Hence, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
