Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (7)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (3)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (2, 5)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 9) -> forms checkout: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (5, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (1, 8)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (0, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (5, 6)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 20
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
