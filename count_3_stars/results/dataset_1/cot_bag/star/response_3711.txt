Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are 40 3-stars in this graph, and we list them as follows: 
[<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 9, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 1)>, <5, (2, 0, 8)>, <5, (2, 1, 8)>, <8, (3, 1, 6)>]
