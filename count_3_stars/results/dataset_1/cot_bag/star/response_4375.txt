Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (4), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (2), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of 39 3-stars in this graph. 

In <> format, the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 9)>,
<4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 3)> 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [39].
