Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 7
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (9, 7, 4)>, <2, (9, 7, 5)>, <2, (7, 1, 3)>, <2, (7, 4, 9)>, <2, (7, 5, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 4)>, <2, (7, 9, 5)>, <2, (9, 4, 5)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 2, 9)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 1)>, <7, (4, 9, 5)>, <7, (9, 1, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 5)>, <7, (9, 5, 4)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (7, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 5, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (4, 7, 5)>, <9, (7, 5, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of 45 3-stars in this graph: [45].
