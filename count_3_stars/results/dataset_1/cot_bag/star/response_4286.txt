Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
By analyzing the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can determine the 3-stars and calculate their total number as follows:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 6
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8
   - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 9
4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 9
5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6
   - <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 9
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
   - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
8. Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 6
9. Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 9
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8
   - <9, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <9, (2, 3, 8)>
   - <9, (2, 5, 8)>
   - <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
