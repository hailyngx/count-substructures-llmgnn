Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
       1 --- 4
      / \    | \
     0   8   |  3
      \ /  \ | /
       5    \|/
            2
            |
            6
            |
            7
```

With this graph layout, we find the following 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [12] 3-stars in the graph.
