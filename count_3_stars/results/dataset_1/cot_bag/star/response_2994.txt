Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.  
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.  
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.  
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):  
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars can be found by adding these numbers:  
\( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14 \)  

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 3, 5)>  
<0, (1, 3, 7)>  
<0, (1, 5, 7)>  
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<0, (3, 5, 9)> 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>  
<0, (5, 7, 9)> 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>  
<3, (0, 4, 8)>  
<7, (1, 5, 8)>  
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
