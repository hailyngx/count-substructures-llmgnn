Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 1, 4, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

For node 1:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \text{ 3-stars} \]

For node 4:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \text{ 3-stars} \]

For node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \text{ 3-stars} \]

For node 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars} \]

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 = 14 3-stars. So, [14].

The unique 3-stars are:

<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (7, 4, 1)>
