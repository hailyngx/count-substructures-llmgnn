Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph and list them, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 4), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9), so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8, 9), so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 4), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
