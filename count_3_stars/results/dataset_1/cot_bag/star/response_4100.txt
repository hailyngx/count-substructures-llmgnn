Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - 3-stars: <5, (3, 4, 7)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - 3-stars: <6, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - 3-stars: <7, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 22

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
