Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the formula provided and the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 90 3-stars

So, there are a total of [90] 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
