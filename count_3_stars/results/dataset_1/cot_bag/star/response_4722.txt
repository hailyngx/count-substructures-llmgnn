Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

The 10 nodes are: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 4 (connected to 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 1: degree 2 (connected to 6, 7)
- Node 5: degree 2 (connected to 0, 7)
- Node 6: degree 4 (connected to 0, 1, 7, 9)
- Node 7: degree 4 (connected to 1, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 8: degree 3 (connected to 0, 7, 9)
- Node 9: degree 3 (connected to 0, 6, 8)

Now, we will find the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14] and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 0, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 0, 1)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
