Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8. 

For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (4, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16.

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
