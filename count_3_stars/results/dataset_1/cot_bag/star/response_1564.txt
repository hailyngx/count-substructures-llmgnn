Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9. There is 1 3-star with node 3.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8. There is 1 3-star with node 5.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 8. There is 1 3-star with node 7.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 21.  
So, the final answer is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>.
