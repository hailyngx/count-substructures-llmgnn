Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms 3-stars:

Node 0: has 1 edge, not enough for a 3-star.

Node 1: has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 8). It can form 1 3-star.

Node 2: has 1 edge, not enough for a 3-star.

Node 3: has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8). It can form 1 3-star.

Node 4: has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

Node 5: has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star.

Node 6: has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9). It can form 1 3-star.

Node 7: has 1 edge, not enough for a 3-star.

Node 8: has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9). It can form 1 3-star.

Node 9: has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8). It can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
