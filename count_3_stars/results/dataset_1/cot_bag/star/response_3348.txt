Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)> 

The final answer is [40].
