Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
   <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>,
   <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>

- Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
  <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>,
   <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>,
   <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>,
   <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>

- Node 4: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) Since node 4 has only 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) Since node 5 has only 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
   <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 9: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) Since node 9 has only 2 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 = 34
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
