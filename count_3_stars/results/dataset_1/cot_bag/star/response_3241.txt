Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed accordingly. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the criteria mentioned earlier.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 2: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated above: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].
