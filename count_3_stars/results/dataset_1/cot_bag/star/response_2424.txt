Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
0: 2, 4
1: 3
2: 0, 4, 8
3: 1, 4, 8, 9
4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
5: 4, 7, 8
7: 4, 5, 9
8: 2, 3, 4, 5
9: 3, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
