Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

So, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
