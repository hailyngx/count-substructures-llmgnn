Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, node 0 has 4 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, node 2 has 2 neighbors, node 3 has 2 neighbors, node 4 has 3 neighbors, node 5 has 3 neighbors, node 6 has 3 neighbors, node 7 has 3 neighbors, node 8 has 3 neighbors, and node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: 
  - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <0, (3, 6, 7)>

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: 
  - <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 do not form any 3-stars because they have exactly 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have [4 + 1] = 5 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
