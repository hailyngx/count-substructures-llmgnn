Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 7, 8).
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7).
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 54 \).

So, there are 54 3-stars in total. Representing them uniquely:
[<2, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>]
