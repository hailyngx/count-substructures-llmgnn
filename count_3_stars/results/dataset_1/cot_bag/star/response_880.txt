Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 4  
Node 1: 6  
Node 2: 3, 7  
Node 3: 0, 2, 8  
Node 4: 0, 7, 9  
Node 5: 6  
Node 6: 1, 5  
Node 7: 2, 4, 8  
Node 8: 3, 7  
Node 9: 4  

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 4)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
