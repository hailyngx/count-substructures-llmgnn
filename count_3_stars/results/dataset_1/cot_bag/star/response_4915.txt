Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 1, node 3, and node 5.

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<3, (1, 5, 8)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 = 9
