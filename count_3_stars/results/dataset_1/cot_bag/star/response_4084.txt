Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37\]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 37.

Therefore, the final answer is: [37]

Some unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
