Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.

Node 1 has degree 4, node 3 has degree 4, node 6 has degree 4, node 7 has degree 4, and node 8 has degree 5.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 6: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 7: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 8: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 26

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>.
