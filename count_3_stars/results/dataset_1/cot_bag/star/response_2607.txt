Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a few nodes which have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated as: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9 \).

Inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [9].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
