Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (6, 4, 9)>
  - <2, (7, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (7, 8, 3)>
  - <2, (7, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <3, (1, 7, 2)>
  - <3, (8, 7, 2)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (7, 5, 9)>
  - <6, (7, 2, 8)>
  - <6, (7, 1, 3)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <8, (2, 7, 5)>
  - <8, (3, 1, 7)>
  - <8, (3, 1, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [26].
