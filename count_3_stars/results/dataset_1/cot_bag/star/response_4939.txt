Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. 

For node 0:
There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 3:
There are 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 4:
There are 3 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 6:
There are 3 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 8:
There are 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 9:
There are 3 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [21] \).

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 4, 9)>
