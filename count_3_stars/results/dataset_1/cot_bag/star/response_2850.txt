Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 8. 

For node 0:
There are 3 choices of pairs of neighbors for node 0, so there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>

For node 1:
There are 4 choices of pairs of neighbors for node 1, so there are \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
There are 5 choices of pairs of neighbors for node 8, so there are \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center. 
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 6 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
