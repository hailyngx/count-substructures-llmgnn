Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Looking at each node:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 have three or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

So, the final answer is [36].  
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 3, 7)>, <1, (6, 3, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 0, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 0, 5)>, <4, (3, 0, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 6)>, <4, (3, 2, 7)>, <4, (3, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 1, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 1, 5)>.
