Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {2, 3, 4}
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {2, 4, 7}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 5}
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 8}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 7}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {2, 7, 8}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 6}

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 14 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
