Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes, we'll analyze each node to see if it is part of a 3-star.

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 8). So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
2. Node 1: Node 1 has 1 neighbor (node 0). Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
3. Node 2: Node 2 has 1 neighbor (node 9). Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
4. Node 3: Node 3 has 1 neighbor (node 7). Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
5. Node 4: Node 4 has 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 7). It can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
6. Node 5: Node 5 has 2 neighbors (nodes 8, 9). It can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
7. Node 6: Node 6 has 1 neighbor (node 8). Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
8. Node 7: Node 7 has 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 4). It can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
9. Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 6). It can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
10. Node 9: Node 9 has 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 5). It can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

Thus, we have a total of [1] 3-star. 
The unique 3-star found is: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
