Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 

The neighbors for each node are:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars.

For node 0: 1 3-star
For node 2: 1 3-star
For node 5: 1 3-star
For node 8: 3 3-stars
For node 9: 1 3-star

So we have a total of [7] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<8, 0, 9>
<8, 2, 9>
<8, 5, 9>
<8, 7, 9>
<9, 0, 2>
