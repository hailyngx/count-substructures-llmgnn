Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 9.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Node 6 is the only node with 3 or more neighbors, so we will focus on finding the number of 3-stars that can be formed with node 6 as the center. Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of node 6:

\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So, there are a total of 10 unique 3-stars involving node 6. Now, we can list them:

\[ [10] \]

<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8, 9)>
