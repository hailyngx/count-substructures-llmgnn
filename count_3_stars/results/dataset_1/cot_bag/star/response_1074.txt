Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
We'll first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- 1 is connected to 0
- 2 is connected to 0, 5, 6, 8
- 3 is connected to 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- 4 is connected to 7
- 5 is connected to 2, 3, 9
- 6 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- 7 is connected to 0, 4, 6, 9
- 8 is connected to 2, 3, 6
- 9 is connected to 0, 3, 5, 7

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 40

Hence, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets [] is 40.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
