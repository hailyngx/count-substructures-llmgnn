Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first create a visual representation of the graph:

```
      1 - 0 - 8
      |   |   |
      7 - 5 - 2
          |   | 
          9 - 4
          |
          6
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 3
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 7: Degree 5

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14 \)

So, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 

<0, 1, 7>
<2, 4, 5>
<7, 5, 8>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 6, 9>
<7, 0, 8>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 2, 8>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 1>
<0, 7, 5>
<0, 7, 6>
