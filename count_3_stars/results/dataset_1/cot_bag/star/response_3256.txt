Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 
Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 3, 4 (degree = 3)
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 5, 7, 8, 9 (degree = 5)
- Node 2: neighbors are 3, 7 (degree = 2)
- Node 3: neighbors are 0, 2, 8 (degree = 3)
- Node 4: neighbors are 0, 5, 6 (degree = 3)
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 4, 9 (degree = 3)
- Node 6: neighbor is 4 (degree = 1)
- Node 7: neighbors are 1, 2, 9 (degree = 3)
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 3 (degree = 2)
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 5, 7 (degree = 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding those up, we have a total of 16 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
