Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

1: 7

2: 4, 5, 6, 9

4: 2, 9

5: 2, 6, 9

6: 2, 5

7: 1

9: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 5 \)

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in the graph. 

List of unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [5].
