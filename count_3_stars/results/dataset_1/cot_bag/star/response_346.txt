Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7

Let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.
- Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 19$. The result is: [19] 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<9, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
