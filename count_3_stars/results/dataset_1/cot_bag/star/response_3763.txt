Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes have the following neighbors:  
- Node 0: 5, 9  
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8    
- Node 2: 1  
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9  
- Node 4: 5  
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4  
- Node 6: 3, 8  
- Node 7: 3, 9  
- Node 8: 1, 6  
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7  

The central nodes for the 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 since they have three or more neighbors.  
For these central nodes:  
- Node 0: 1 3-star  
- Node 1: 1 3-star  
- Node 3: 1 3-star  
- Node 6: 1 3-star  
- Node 7: 1 3-star  
- Node 8: 1 3-star  
- Node 9: 1 3-star  

The total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (5, 9, 0)>  
<1, (2, 5, 1)>  
<3, (6, 7, 3)>  
<6, (8, 1, 6)>  
<7, (9, 0, 7)>  
<8, (6, 3, 9)>  
<9, (7, 3, 9)>
