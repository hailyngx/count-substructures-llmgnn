Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
        0------4---6
        |      |   
        |      |  
        3--2---1---7
             \ /   
              8---5
              |
              9
```

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8): we have 1 3-star <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8, 9): we have 4 3-stars <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8): we have 1 3-star <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6): we have 4 3-stars <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5): we have 4 3-stars <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (1, 2): no 3-star can be formed as it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 14.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>.
