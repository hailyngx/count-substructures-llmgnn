Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes.

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 5 → it has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 8 → it has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 9 → it has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5 → it has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 7 → it has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 8 → it has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has neighbors: 5, 9 → it has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 6 → it has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 7→ it has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [] = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>
