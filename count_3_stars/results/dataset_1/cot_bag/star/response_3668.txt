Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

We calculate the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [^1inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: [^1inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
- Node 4: [^1inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [^1inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: [^1inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: [^1inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: [^1inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 27\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
