Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {0, 3}

Let's calculate the 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: 1 3-star can be formed, so we have <1, (3, 4, 8)>.
- Node 2: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: 1 3-star can be formed, so we have <3, (1, 4, 6)>.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: 1 3-star can be formed, so we have <7, (0, 2, 6)>.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star formed is <3, (1, 4, 6)>.
