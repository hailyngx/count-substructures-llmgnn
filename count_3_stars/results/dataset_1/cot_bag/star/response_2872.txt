Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find all the 3-stars.

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0

Therefore, we have 1 unique 3-star in this graph, which is: 
[<0, 1, 4, 8>]
