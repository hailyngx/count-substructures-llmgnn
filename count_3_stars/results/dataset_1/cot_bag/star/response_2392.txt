Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
