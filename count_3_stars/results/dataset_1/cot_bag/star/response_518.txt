Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph:

```
   1----6
  /|    |\
 8-0----4-6
 | |   /|
 7-9--2-3
```

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: Has 4 neighbors (1, 7, 8, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: Has 2 neighbors (9), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3: Has 2 neighbors (9), so it cannot form any 3-star. 
- Node 4: Has 2 neighbors (6), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6: Has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 6), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: Has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 8, 9), so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9: Has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 8, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 8)>, <6, (4, 6, 1)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 8, 8)>, <8, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (8, 9, 2)>, <9, (8, 9, 3)>
