Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.
  <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>

- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors (0, 3), so no 3-stars can be formed with node 1.

- Node 3: It has 2 neighbors (1, 7), so no 3-stars can be formed with node 3.

- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (0, 8), so no 3-stars can be formed with node 6.

- Node 7: It has 2 neighbors (3, 4), so no 3-stars can be formed with node 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4. 
Thus, the final answer is [4].
