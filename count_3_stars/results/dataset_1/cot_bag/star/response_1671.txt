Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {8, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 7}

Node 1, 2, 5, and 9 each have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.

For Node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 3-stars

For Node 2:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

For Node 5:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars

For Node 9:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \] 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 16 \)

So, the final count of 3-stars: [16]

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
