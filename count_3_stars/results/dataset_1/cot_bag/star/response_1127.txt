Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:
Node 0: 4, 5
Node 1: 8
Node 2: 7
Node 3: 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 4, 8
Node 8: 1, 6, 7
Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 1: inom{0}{3} = 0
Node 2: inom{0}{3} = 0
Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up all the 3-stars found for each node, we get a total of 16 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
