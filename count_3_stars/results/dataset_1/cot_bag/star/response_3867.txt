Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first organize the given information in a graph format:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 5), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 5)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 6, 8

Calculations:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 5.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star centered at node 6.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed with node 8.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
