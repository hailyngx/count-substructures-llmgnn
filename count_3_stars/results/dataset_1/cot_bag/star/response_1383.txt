Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, we will find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Let's start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 8. So, Node 0 can form 1 3-star.

Node 1 has 2 neighbors (2 and 7), which is less than 3, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, and 7. So, Node 2 can form 4 3-stars.

Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0 and 8), which is less than 3, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 9. So, Node 4 can form 1 3-star.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors (2 and 7), which is less than 3, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, and 8. So, Node 7 can form 4 3-stars.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, and 7. So, Node 8 can form 4 3-stars.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor (4), which is less than 3, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by the nodes, we get a total of 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 1)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 2)>
<7, (2, 6, 1)>
<7, (6, 2, 1)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
