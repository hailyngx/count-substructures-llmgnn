Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will construct the 3-stars based on those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 9)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 2, 4)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For Node 1: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] 
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>

For Node 3: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>

For Node 7: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>

For Node 8: 
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \] (As it has less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>
