Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 0, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16 

So, there are a total of 16 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 0, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 2, 7>
<4, 6, 7>
<4, 7, 9>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 2, 4>
<7, 4, 9>
<7, 5, 9>
<7, 9, 0>
<7, 9, 4>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 7, 0>

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
