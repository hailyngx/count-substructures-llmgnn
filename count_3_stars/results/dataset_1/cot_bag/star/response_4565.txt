Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degree of each node based on the given edges:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3

Now, we will identify the 3-stars formed by each node with degree 3 or more:
- Node 0 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars by summing up the individual counts: 
4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 3, 7)>
<4, (7, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
