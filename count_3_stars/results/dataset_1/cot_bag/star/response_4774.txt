Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are few nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 1, node 2, node 3, node 4, and node 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So the total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8\).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
