Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
There are 4 neighbors for node 0, and we can choose 3 of them to form a 3-star. So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>

For node 2:
There are 2 neighbors for node 2, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 7:
There are 4 neighbors for node 7, and we can choose 3 of them to form a 3-star. So, the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>

Counting all the 3-stars, we have a total of 8 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
