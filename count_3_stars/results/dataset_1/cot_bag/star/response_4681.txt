Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing these up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
