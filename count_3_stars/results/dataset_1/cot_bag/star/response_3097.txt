Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}. Let's identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (7, 9, 7)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 2)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 4)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 7) = 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 9, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 2)>
<7, (4, 2, 2)>
<7, (2, 2, 3)>
