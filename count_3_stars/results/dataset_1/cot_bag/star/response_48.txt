Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (3, 6, 8). \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star can be formed with node 4 as the center: <4, (3, 6, 8)>.

Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 7, 9). \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.

Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.
