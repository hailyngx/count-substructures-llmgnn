Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes in this graph that have at least 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 1, 3>
<5, 4, 7>
<8, 1, 3>
