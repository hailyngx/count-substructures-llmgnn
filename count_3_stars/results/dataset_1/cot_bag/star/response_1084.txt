Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To start, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
As nodes 3, 6, and 9 each have less than 3 neighbors, they do not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 34.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars are:

- <0, 2, 4, 5>
- <1, 2, 5, 7>
- <2, 0, 1, 4>
- <2, 0, 1, 5>
- <2, 0, 1, 7>
- <2, 0, 4, 7>
- <2, 1, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 5, 7>
- <2, 0, 4, 6>
- <2, 0, 4, 9>
- <2, 1, 5, 6>
- <2, 1, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 5, 6>
- <2, 4, 5, 9>
- <4, 0, 7, 6>
- <4, 0, 7, 5>
- <5, 0, 7, 6>
- <5, 1, 7, 6>
- <7, 1, 5, 6>
- <7, 1, 5, 9>
- <7, 4, 5, 6>
- <7, 4, 5, 9>
