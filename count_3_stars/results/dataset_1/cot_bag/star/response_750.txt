Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
Node 2 is connected to node 8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 6.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
Node 8 is connected to node 2.
Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: <5, (0, 3, 4)> and <5, (0, 4, 6)>
No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so we have a total of 6 different 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
