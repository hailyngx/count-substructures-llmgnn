Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
For node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
For node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
For node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>.
