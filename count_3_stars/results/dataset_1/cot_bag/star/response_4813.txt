Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbor {4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 20. 

Therefore, the answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
