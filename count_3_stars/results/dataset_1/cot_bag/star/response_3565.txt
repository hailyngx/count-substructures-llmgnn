Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 20 + 35 + 35 = 94 \), which gives us the total number of 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [94].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
