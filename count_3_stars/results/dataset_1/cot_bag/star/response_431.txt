Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
        The 3-stars are:
        [<0, (3, 9, 7)>, <1, (2, 9, 4)>, <2, (1, 5, 4)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 9, 1)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 3)>]
        Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9].
