Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each such node and sum them up to find the total number of 3-stars.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9
Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
Node 3 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<3, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 9 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = 16.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
