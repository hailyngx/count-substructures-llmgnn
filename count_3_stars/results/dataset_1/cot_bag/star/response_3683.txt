Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, for each of those nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed.

Looking at the list of edges given:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Nodes 2, 4, 6, 9 each have 3 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Since each node with three or more neighbors forms one 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
