Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8
Node 2: 1, 5, 7
Node 3: 4, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 3, 6
Node 5: 0, 2, 9
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8
Node 7: 2, 8
Node 8: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 5, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 32

Thus, the final number inside brackets is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 6>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 5, 6>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 5, 0>
<3, 6, 8>
<4, 0, 6>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 3, 6>
<8, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 9>
