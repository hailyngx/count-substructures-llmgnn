Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
