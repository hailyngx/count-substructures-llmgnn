Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (degree 2).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (degree 4). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, and <1, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (degree 3).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (degree 3).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (degree 4). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, and <4, (3, 6, 9)>.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (degree 1).
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (degree 5). There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. These should be listed individually.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (degree 4). There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, and <7, (1, 6, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (degree 3).
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (degree 5). There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center. These should be listed individually.

In summary, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 9) = 32. 

Therefore, the final answer is [32].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>,
<4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>,
<6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (6, 7, 9)>,
<7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>,
<9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>
