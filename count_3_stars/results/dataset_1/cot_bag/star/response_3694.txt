Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  <1, (3, 5, 9)> <1, (3, 6, 9)> <1, (5, 6, 9)> <1, (3, 5, 6)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  <3, (0, 1, 9)> <3, (0, 5, 9)> <3, (1, 5, 8)> <3, (1, 6, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  <5, (0, 1, 9)> <5, (0, 3, 9)> <5, (1, 3, 8)> <5, (1, 6, 9)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 9:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
  <9, (1, 3, 5)> <9, (1, 3, 6)> <9, (1, 5, 6)> <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [12]. So, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)> <1, (3, 6, 9)> <1, (5, 6, 9)> <1, (3, 5, 6)> <3, (0, 1, 9)> <3, (0, 5, 9)> <3, (1, 5, 8)> <3, (1, 6, 9)> <5, (0, 1, 9)> <5, (0, 3, 9)> <5, (1, 3, 8)> <5, (1, 6, 9)>
