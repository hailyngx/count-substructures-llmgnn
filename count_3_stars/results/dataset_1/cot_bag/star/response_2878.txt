Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Edges (in no specific order):
  - 0: 4, 8, 9
  - 1: 6
  - 2: 4, 8
  - 4: 0, 2, 6, 8
  - 5: 6, 8
  - 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
  - 8: 0, 2, 4, 5
  - 9: 0, 6

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9), so it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 8), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 9), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 5), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \).

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
