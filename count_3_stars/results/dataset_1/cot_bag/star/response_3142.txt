Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node with its neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7).
  - Total 3-stars from node 0: [1]

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3).
  - Total 3-stars from node 1: [1]

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9).
  - Total 3-stars from node 2: [1]

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9).
  - Total 3-stars from node 3: [1]

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (2, 6), which is less than 3.

- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (6), which is less than 3.

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 7).
  - Total 3-stars from node 6: [1]

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 9).
  - Total 3-stars from node 7: [1]

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7).
  - Total 3-stars from node 9: [1]

Adding up all the 3-stars possibilities from the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, 1, 6, 7>
<1, 0, 2, 3>
<2, 1, 4, 9>
<3, 1, 6, 9>
<6, 0, 3, 7>
