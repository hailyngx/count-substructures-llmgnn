Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

From the given information, the degree of each node is:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Only nodes 3, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will compute the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
