Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the given edges are:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

The only node with 3 neighbors is node 1. So, there is only 1 3-star in this graph with node 1 as the center. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-star is <1, (3, 6, 9)>.
