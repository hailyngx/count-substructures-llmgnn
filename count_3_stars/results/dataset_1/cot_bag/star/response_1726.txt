Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we can identify the nodes with their neighbors to see which nodes form a 3-star.

Nodes with neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 6) = 12
So, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
