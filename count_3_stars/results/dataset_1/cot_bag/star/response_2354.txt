Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

For each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

For node 2: 
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars = <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>

So far, we have found 4 3-stars for node 2.

Finally, let's sum up the total number of 3-stars so far:
[4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
