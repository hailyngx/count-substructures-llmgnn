Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 0, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing all possibilities: 35 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 89

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [89].
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
