Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 2, 7
Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7
Node 3: 6, 7
Node 5: 2, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 3
Node 8: 0, 5
Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
