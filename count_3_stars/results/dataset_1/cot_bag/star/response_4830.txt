Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: Only connects to node 9, forming one 3-star <0, (9, 9, 9)>.
Node 1: Connects to nodes 3, 6. Forms one 3-star <1, (3, 6, 6)>.
Node 2: Connects to node 5. Does not form a 3-star.
Node 3: Connects to node 1. Does not form a 3-star.
Node 4: Connects to node 6. Does not form a 3-star.
Node 5: Connects to nodes 2, 6. Does not form a 3-star.
Node 6: Connects to nodes 1, 4, 5. Forms three 3-stars <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 1, 5)>, <6, (5, 1, 4)>.
Node 7: Not connected to any other node. Does not form a 3-star.
Node 8: Connects to node 9. Does not form a 3-star.
Node 9: Connects to nodes 0, 8. Forms one 3-star <9, (0, 8, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 3 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 9) = 6. So, the answer is [6].
