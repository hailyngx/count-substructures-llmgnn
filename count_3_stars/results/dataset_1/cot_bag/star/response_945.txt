Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. Since it's mentioned that the graph has 10 nodes, we need to analyze each node to see if it can form 3-stars.

The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: Neighbors 5, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors 4, 8
- Node 2: Neighbors 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors 2, 5
- Node 4: Neighbors 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: Neighbors 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors 4, 7
- Node 7: Neighbors 2, 6
- Node 8: Neighbors 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: Neighbor 0

Nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed for the remaining nodes:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
  inom{4}{3} = 4
  inom{4}{3} = 4
  Total = 12

- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0

- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
  inom{4}{3} = 4
  inom{4}{3} = 4
  Total = 12

- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
  inom{4}{3} = 4
  inom{4}{3} = 4
  Total = 12

- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0

- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [12 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 1] = 25.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 2)>, <2, (4, 8, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 0)>, <3, (2, 5, 4)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 2)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 2)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 2)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 4)>, <7, (2, 6, 7)>, and <8, (1, 2, 5)>.
