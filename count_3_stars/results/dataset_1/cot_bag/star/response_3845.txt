Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors first:
Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 7 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 35 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
