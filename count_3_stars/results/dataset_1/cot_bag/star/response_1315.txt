Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7)]

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14 3-stars

So, the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
