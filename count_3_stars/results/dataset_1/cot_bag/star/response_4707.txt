Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

```
   0 --- 2
   |     |
   4 --- 1 --- 6
   |     |     |
   5     8     5
          \     \
           9 --- 3
             |
             7
```

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
  Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
  
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 8, 9)
  Number of 3-stars:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars: 
  <1, (2, 4, 6)>, 
  <1, (2, 4, 8)>, 
  <1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
  <1, (2, 6, 8)>, 
  <1, (2, 6, 9)>, 
  <1, (2, 8, 9)>, 
  <1, (4, 6, 8)>, 
  <1, (4, 6, 9)>, 
  <1, (4, 8, 9)>, 
  <1, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 9)
  Number of 3-stars:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>

- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7, 8)
  Number of 3-stars:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars:
  <4, (0, 1, 5)>, 
  <4, (0, 1, 7)>, 
  <4, (0, 1, 8)>, 
  <4, (0, 5, 7)>, 
  <4, (0, 5, 8)>, 
  <4, (0, 7, 8)>, 
  <4, (1, 5, 7)>, 
  <4, (1, 5, 8)>, 
  <4, (1, 7, 8)>, 
  <4, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6)
  Number of 3-stars:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26].
