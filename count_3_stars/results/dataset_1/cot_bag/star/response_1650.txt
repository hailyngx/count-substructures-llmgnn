Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.


Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 and node 8 each have 2 other neighbors, so they don't form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 also has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor and doesn't form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) = 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 4, 5)> and <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
