Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = inom{0}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} = 2 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = 6 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6)>
- <1, (3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
