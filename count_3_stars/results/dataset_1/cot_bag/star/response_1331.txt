Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 1: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 2: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 4: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 5: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>.
