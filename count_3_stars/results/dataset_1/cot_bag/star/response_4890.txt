Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms:
   - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <0, (5, 7, 9)>
   - [4] 3-stars

2. Node 3 forms:
   - <3, (0, 2, 8)>
   - [1] 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 1] = 5.
