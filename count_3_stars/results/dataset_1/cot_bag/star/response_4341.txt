Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges: (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 8), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 4)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 6.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 5, 9.
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 4, 7, 8.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (7, 8, 4)>
