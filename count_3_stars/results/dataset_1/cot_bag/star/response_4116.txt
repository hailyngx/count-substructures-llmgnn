Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, node 3, and node 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 2:
\( \binom {3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For node 3:
\( \binom {4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 8:
\( \binom {5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16 \), which can be represented as \( [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
