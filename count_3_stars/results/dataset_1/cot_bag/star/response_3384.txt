Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
- Node 0: 3, 4  
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9  
- Node 2: 1, 9  
- Node 3: 0, 1  
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8  
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8  
- Node 6: 5  
- Node 7: 5  
- Node 8: 4, 5, 9  
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8  

Considering the number of neighbors of each node, we have:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it can't form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it can't form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8. Putting it inside brackets, we get [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 9, 1)>
- <4, (5, 8, 4)>
- <5, (6, 7, 5)>
- <5, (8, 9, 5)>
- <5, (6, 8, 5)>
- <5, (6, 9, 5)>
- <5, (7, 9, 5)>
- <8, (4, 9, 8)>
