Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 9
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 0: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 5
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 2: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 5)>, <2, (0, 8, 5)>, <2, (5, 8, 5)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
There is 1 3-star with node 4: <4, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 5: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9
There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 8: <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>

Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 9: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Putting all unique 3-stars together: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 5)>, <2, (0, 8, 5)>, <2, (5, 8, 5)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 27.
