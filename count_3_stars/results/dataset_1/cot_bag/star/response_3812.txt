Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 1: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- For node 4: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- For node 5: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- For node 6: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- For node 9: 3-stars formed = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
