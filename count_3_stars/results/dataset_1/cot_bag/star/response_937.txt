Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 3-stars
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 9 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [21]
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>
