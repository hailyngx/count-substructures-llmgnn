Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start constructing the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

So, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- For node 4: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3, which we represent inside brackets as [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
