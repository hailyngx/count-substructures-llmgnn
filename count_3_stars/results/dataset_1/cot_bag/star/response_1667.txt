Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph:

```
   0 ----- 1
   |       |
   4       |
           |
   3 ----- 5
           |
   8 ----- 9
```

Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Since node 0 has 2 neighbors (1, 4), it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 1:
- Similarly, node 1 cannot form any 3-stars as it also has 2 neighbors (0, 4).

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (4, 5), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <4, (0, 1, 8)>.
