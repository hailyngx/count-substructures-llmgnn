Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 4, 7, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 4
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 2, 7

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors.

For node 0, there are 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 1, there are 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For node 2, there are 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>.

For node 7, there are 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 1, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( [1+1+4+10] = 16 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 16.
