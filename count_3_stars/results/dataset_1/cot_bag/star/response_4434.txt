Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first list out the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 1: 3, 4  
Node 2: 4  
Node 3: 1, 9  
Node 4: 1, 2, 8  
Node 6: 9  
Node 7: 8  
Node 8: 4, 7  
Node 9: 3, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)  
Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)  

There are no nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so there are no 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [0].
