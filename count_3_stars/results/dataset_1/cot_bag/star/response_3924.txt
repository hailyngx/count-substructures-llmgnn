Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4] = 30 \)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 30, and the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
