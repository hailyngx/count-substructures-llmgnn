Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes.

#### Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

#### Total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars for each node: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21 \)

Thus, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (2, 9, 7)>
- <4, (9, 7, 0)>
