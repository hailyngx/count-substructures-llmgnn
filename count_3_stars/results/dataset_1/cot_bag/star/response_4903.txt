Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26

So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
