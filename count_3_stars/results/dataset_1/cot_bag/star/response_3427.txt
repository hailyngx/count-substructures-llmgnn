Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, there are \( 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 46 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Inside brackets: [46]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 6, 9)>, <1, (8, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 6)>, <4, (9, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 4)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 1, 4)>, <6, (8, 1, 4)>, <6, (8, 1, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>
