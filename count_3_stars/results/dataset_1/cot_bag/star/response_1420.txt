Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors. Based on the given edges, we can determine the degrees of each node:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 10 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 4)>
- <4, (0, 6, 5)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <6, (0, 5, 4)>
- <6, (0, 7, 4)>
- <8, (1, 9, 3)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 5)>
