Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To analyze this graph, we'll first list out the neighbors of each node:

Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8  
Node 2: 1, 5  
Node 3: 1  
Node 4: 1, 5  
Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6  
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 9  
Node 7: 6, 8  
Node 8: 1, 7  
Node 9: 6  

Now we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 5 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as \( 20 + 20 + 4 = 44 \), so we put [44] in brackets.   

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:  

<1, (2, 4, 5)>  
<1, (2, 5, 8)>  
<1, (2, 6, 8)>  
<1, (4, 5, 6)>  
<1, (4, 5, 8)>  
<1, (5, 6, 8)>  
<1, (5, 6, 9)>  
<1, (5, 7, 9)>  
<1, (6, 7, 9)>  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>  
<5, (2, 4, 8)>  
<5, (2, 6, 8)>  
<5, (4, 6, 8)>  
<5, (6, 7, 9)>  
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
