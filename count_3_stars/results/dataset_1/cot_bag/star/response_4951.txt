Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars involving each of these nodes.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star

Since each of these nodes contributes 1 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 5, 6, 9>
<3, 0, 6, 8>
<5, 1, 7, 9>
<6, 1, 3, 8>
<7, 4, 5, 9>
