Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that specific node.

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 12 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
