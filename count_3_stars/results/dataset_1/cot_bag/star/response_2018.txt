Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of those nodes.

For node 0, it has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 6).
So, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), which gives us <0, (4, 5, 6)>.

For node 2, it has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 8).
So, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), which gives us <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>.

For node 3, it has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5).
So, the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), which gives us <3, (2, 4, 5)>.

For node 4, it has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 9).
So, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), which gives us <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>.

For node 5, it has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7, 8).
So, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), which gives us <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>.

For node 6, it has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7).
So, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), which gives us <6, (0, 2, 7)>.

For node 8, it has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9).
So, the number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), which gives us <8, (2, 5, 9)>.

For node 9, it has 2 neighbors (4, 8).
Since a node needs at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star, node 9 does not form any 3-star.

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, we have <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>.

As a result, there are 16 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [16].
