Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges.  

The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The edges are: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7).

The graph:
```
   1
   | \
   3 - 2
   | X | X 
   4 - 0 - 5
       |   |
       8 - 7
           |
           9
```

Analyzing the graph, we find the nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 7, and 9.

1. For node 0: There is an edge between 0 and 2, 0 and 5, and 0 and 7. Therefore, a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
2. For node 3: There are edges between 3 and 1, 3 and 2, 3 and 7, and 3 and 8. Therefore, a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. For node 7: There are edges between 7 and 0, 7 and 3, and 7 and 9. Therefore, a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
4. For node 9: There are edges between 9 and 0, 9 and 5, and 9 and 7. Therefore, a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Summing up, there are a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 2, 5, 7>
<3, 1, 2, 8>
<3, 1, 7, 8>
<3, 2, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 8, 9>
<7, 0, 9, 5>
<7, 3, 9, 9>
