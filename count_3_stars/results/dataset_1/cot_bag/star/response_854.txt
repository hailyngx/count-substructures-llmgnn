Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- Node 1 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
   - <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 2 has no 3-stars formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 3 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>
  
- Node 4 has no 3-stars formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has no 3-stars formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 6 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
   - <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>
  
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>
  
- Node 8 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
   - <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
  
- Node 9 has no 3-stars formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32]
