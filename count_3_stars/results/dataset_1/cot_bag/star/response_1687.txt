Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9)
(1, 4), (1, 7)
(2, 7)
(3, 0), (3, 8)
(4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 9)
(5, 6)
(6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5)
(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8)
(8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 9)
(9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Check each node to see if it has three or more neighbors.

For the nodes:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9)
Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 1 neighbor
Node 3 has 2 neighbors
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 9)
Node 5 has 1 neighbor
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5)
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8)
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 9)
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Based on the above analysis, we can see that nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 can form 3-stars.

For these nodes:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 9)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 6 forms 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 5)>
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 8)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 7, 9)>
Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
