Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first draw the graph based on the nodes and edges listed. 

The graph has the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4.

Now we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph using the method described earlier.

Calculations for each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 3, 7), 1 3-star (0, 3, 9) Total: 2
- Node 3: 1 3-star (3, 0, 7), 1 3-star (3, 0, 9) Total: 2
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 5, 7), 1 3-star (4, 5, 9) Total: 2

Adding these up gives a total of 6 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <4, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 9>
