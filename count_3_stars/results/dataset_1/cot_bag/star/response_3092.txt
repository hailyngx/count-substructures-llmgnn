Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we'll examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

For each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8)
- 1 3-star <0, (1, 4, 8)>

Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9)
- 1 3-star <1, (0, 4, 9)>

Node 2: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 9)
- 1 3-star <2, (3, 4, 5)>

Node 3: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 9)
- 1 3-star <3, (2, 4, 7)>

Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 7)
- 1 3-star <4, (0, 1, 7)>

Node 5: 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8, 9)
- 1 3-star <5, (2, 6, 9)>

Node 7: 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8, 9)
- 1 3-star <7, (3, 6, 8)>

Node 9: 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8)
- 1 3-star <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, and <9, (1, 3, 8)>.
