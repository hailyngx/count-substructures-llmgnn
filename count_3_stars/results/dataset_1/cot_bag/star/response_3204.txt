Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].

The 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
