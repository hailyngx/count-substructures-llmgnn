Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0 with 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star formed: <0, (2, 7, 9)>.

For node 4 with 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed: 
<4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.

For node 5 with 5 neighbors, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed: 
<5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 9 with 5 neighbors, there are 10 3-stars formed: 
<9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 31 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final count of the total number of 3-stars is [31].
