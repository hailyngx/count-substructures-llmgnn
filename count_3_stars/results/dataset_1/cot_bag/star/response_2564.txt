Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5)
Node 3: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 3)
Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7)

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up these counts, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:

\[ [ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ] = [ 5 ] \]

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
