Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [25].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>
