Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors: 

- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 5, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 and Node 5 have 2 neighbors each.
- Node 6 and Node 9 have 2 neighbors each.

There are no nodes with three or more neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
