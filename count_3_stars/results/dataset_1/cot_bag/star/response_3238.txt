Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 3, 4, 2, 1, 5, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding these up: \(1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26\)

So, there are a total of 26 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting this in brackets: [26]

The unique 3-stars are:

<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 1)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 0, 1)>
<4, (3, 0, 6)>
<4, (3, 1, 0)>
<4, (3, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
