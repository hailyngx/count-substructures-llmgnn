Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 

- Node 0 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 1 (with 3 neighbors)
- Node 2 (with 3 neighbors)
- Node 3 (with 5 neighbors)
- Node 4 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 5 (with 5 neighbors)
- Node 6 (with 4 neighbors)
- Node 7 (with 5 neighbors)
- Node 8 (with 3 neighbors)
- Node 9 (with 4 neighbors)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
\(4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 49\)

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].

And the unique 3-stars are:
