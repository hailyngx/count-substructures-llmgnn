Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
With the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 4 and 5
- 1 is connected to 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- 2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- 3 is connected to 1, 2, 8
- 4 is connected to 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- 5 is connected to 0, 1, 4, 7
- 6 is connected to 1, 2
- 7 is connected to 2, 5
- 8 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 9
- 9 is connected to 4, 8

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph: 

Node 1 forms <1, (2, 3, 6)> and <1, (5, 8, 6)>.
Node 2 forms <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, and <2, (3, 4, 7)>.
Node 3 forms <3, (1, 2, 8)>.
Node 4 forms <4, (0, 2, 9)>.
Node 5 forms <5, (0, 1, 7)>.
Node 8 forms <8, (1, 3, 9)>.

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
