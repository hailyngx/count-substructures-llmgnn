Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors (highest degree).
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 contributes: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 contributes: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 contributes: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 1 + 20 = 22 \) [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)> <7, (0, 1, 3)> <7, (0, 1, 5)> <7, (1, 2, 3)> <7, (1, 2, 5)> <7, (1, 3, 5)> <7, (0, 2, 3)> <7, (0, 2, 5)> <7, (0, 3, 5)> <7, (2, 3, 5)> <7, (0, 2, 8)> <7, (0, 3, 8)> <7, (2, 3, 8)> <7, (0, 5, 8)> <7, (1, 2, 8)> <7, (1, 3, 8)> <7, (1, 5, 8)> <7, (2, 3, 9)> <7, (2, 5, 9)> <7, (3, 5, 9)>
