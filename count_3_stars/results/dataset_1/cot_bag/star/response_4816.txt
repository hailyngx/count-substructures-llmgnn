Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: has 4 neighbors
Node 3: has 3 neighbors
Node 4: has 6 neighbors
Node 5: has 4 neighbors
Node 6: has 5 neighbors
Node 8: has 3 neighbors
Node 9: has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up, we have a total of 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 38 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 2, 6)>
<1, (4, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 0, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 0)>
<4, (2, 6, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 2)>
<6, (2, 0, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 0)>
<6, (2, 5, 4)>
<6, (4, 0, 2)>
<6, (4, 2, 0)>
<6, (4, 2, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 2)>
