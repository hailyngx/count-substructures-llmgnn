Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll examine each node that has three or more neighbors. We'll look at nodes 0, 1, 7, 8, and 9 since they each have at least 3 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7). So, we can form 1 3-star.
Node 1: It has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 7). So, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9). So, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 9). So, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8). So, we can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars formed around each of these nodes, we get a total of 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
