Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 1, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 4)>, <3, (1, 6, 4)>, <3, (6, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 6)>, <4, (1, 8, 6)>, <4, (8, 6, 5)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 6, 4)>, <8, (6, 4, 0)>, <8, (4, 0, 2)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [41].
