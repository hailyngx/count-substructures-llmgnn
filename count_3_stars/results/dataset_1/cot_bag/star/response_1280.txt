Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 44 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

- <3, (4, 2, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 6)>
- <3, (7, 4, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (6, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 0, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 0, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (4, 0, 6)>
