Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 6, and 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 5, and 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 6, and 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 3, 4, and 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 2, 4, and 7 (4 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 7)>.
