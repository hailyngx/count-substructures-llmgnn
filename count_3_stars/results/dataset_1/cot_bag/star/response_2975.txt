Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph, we first look at each node to determine which nodes it is connected to.  

Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8  
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9  
Node 5 is connected to nodes 3  
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8  
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9  
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors.  

For node 0: [1 3-star]  
<0, (6, 8)>  

For node 1: [1 3-star]  
<1, (2, 6, 7)>  

For node 2: [0 3-stars]  

For node 3: [0 3-stars]  

For node 4: [2 3-stars]  
<4, (3, 6, 9)>  
<4, (6, 8, 9)>  

For node 6: [6 3-stars]  
<6, (0, 1, 2)>  
<6, (0, 4, 8)>  
<6, (1, 2, 8)>  
<6, (1, 4, 8)>  
<6, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (4, 8, 9)>  

For node 8: [3 3-stars]  
<8, (0, 2, 6)>  
<8, (0, 7, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 6)>  

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of [13] unique 3-stars.
