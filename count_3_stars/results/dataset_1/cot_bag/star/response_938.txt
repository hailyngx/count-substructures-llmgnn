Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are no 3-star graphs in this graph since no node has exactly three neighbors. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [0].
