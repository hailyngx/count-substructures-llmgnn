Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Applying the method described to find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9. So, it forms 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 5, 9)>.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8. So, it forms 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (5, 7, 8)>.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 9. So, it forms 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9. So, it forms 10 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 9. So, it forms 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
Node 9 has 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. So, it forms 35 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, there are 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 35 = 52 3-stars in this graph, and the total number of 3-stars is [52].
