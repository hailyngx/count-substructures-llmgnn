Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>.
