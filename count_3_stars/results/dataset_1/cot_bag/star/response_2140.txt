Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 
The graph can be described as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 3, and 9: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 5, and 9: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, and 6: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, and 7: <6, (1, 5, 7)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 7, and 9: <8, (0, 7, 9)>


Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5, so the final answer is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, and <8, (0, 7, 9)>
