Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Here are the 3-stars in this graph:
- There are 2 3-stars centered at Node 0: <0, (5, 8, 9)> and <0, (8, 9, 5)>
- There are 2 3-stars centered at Node 5: <5, (0, 8, 9)> and <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- There are 3 3-stars centered at Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, and <9, (6, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is [7].
