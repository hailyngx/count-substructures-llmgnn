Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32 \]

Therefore, there are 32 3-stars in the graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Thus, the final answer is [32].
