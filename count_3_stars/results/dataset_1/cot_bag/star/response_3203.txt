Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, resulting in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 42 3-stars. Putting this number inside brackets gives us [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (2, 8, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 4)>
<4, (2, 8, 3)>
<4, (2, 9, 3)>
<4, (3, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 2, 9)>
