Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges. Since the graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's draw it out before identifying the 3-stars.

The graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 3 --- 2 --- 8 --- 9
|     |     |     |     |
6 --- 7 --- 1 --- 5 --- 4
```

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 6 (less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9 (3 neighbors, so 1 3-star formed: <1, (4, 5, 7)>).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8 (3 neighbors, so 1 3-star formed: <2, (3, 5, 8)>).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4 (3 neighbors, so 1 3-star formed: <3, (0, 2, 4)>).
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 3 (less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9 (3 neighbors, so 1 3-star formed: <5, (1, 2, 8)>).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7 (less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 8 (3 neighbors, so 1 3-star formed: <7, (1, 6, 8)>).
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9 (3 neighbors, so 1 3-star formed: <8, (2, 5, 7)>).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8 (less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-star).

In total, there are 4 unique 3-stars, so the answer is [4]. The 3-stars are: 
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
