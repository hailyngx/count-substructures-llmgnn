Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

```
Graph:
0 --- 3
|\    |\
| \   | \
|  \  |  \
4   7 9   1 -- 2
            |  |\
            |  | \
            5  6 8
```

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 2: It has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6, 7). So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 5: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 7). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>

Adding all the 3-stars, we have: [4 + 10 + 4] = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 18.
