Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

- Node 0 has three neighbors (8, 9), hence it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 5 has five neighbors (2, 3, 7, 8, 9), hence it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has four neighbors (5, 6, 9), hence it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has four neighbors (0, 5, 9), hence it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has six neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), hence it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 39 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
