Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 35 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 0, 7)>
<4, (5, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 4)>
<8, (2, 1, 4)>
<8, (4, 1, 5)>
<8, (9, 4, 0)>
