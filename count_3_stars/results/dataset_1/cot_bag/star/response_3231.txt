Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 0), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 5), (9, 7)]

Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.  

Calculating for node 0:  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6  
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- 3-star combinations for node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>  

Calculating for node 1:  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8  
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- 3-star combination for node 1: <1, (0, 7, 8)>  

Calculating for node 5:  
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 8, 5  
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- 3-star combinations for node 5: <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>  

Calculating for node 6:  
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7  
- No 3-stars can be formed with node 6 as the center since it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Calculating for node 7:  
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 9  
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- 3-star combination for node 7: <7, (1, 6, 9)>  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10  
Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph.  

Putting the final count inside brackets: [10]  
Listing the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>
