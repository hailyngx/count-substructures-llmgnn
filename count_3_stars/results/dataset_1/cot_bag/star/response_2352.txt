Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (degree 6)
- Node 1 (degree 3)
- Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 5 (degree 4)
- Node 6 (degree 4)
- Node 9 (degree 6)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48

There are a total of 48 3-stars in this graph.
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)> 

The total number of 3-stars is [48].
