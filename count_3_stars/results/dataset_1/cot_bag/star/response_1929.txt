Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9, making a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>

Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9, making a total of \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 6, so only 1 3-star is formed.
<3, (0, 2, 6)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, and 8, making a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>

The other nodes have less than 3 neighbors and thus do not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(10 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 35\), so the final answer is [35].
