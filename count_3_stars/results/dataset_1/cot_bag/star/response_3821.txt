Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to determine which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes.

Let's first identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)> <0, (2, 5, 8)> <0, (4, 5, 6)> <0, (5, 6, 8)> <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [27].
