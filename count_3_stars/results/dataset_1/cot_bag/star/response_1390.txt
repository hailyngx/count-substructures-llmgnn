Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 3 3-stars.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed by the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<(5, 7, 8), 9>
