Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, with the given edges connecting them. 

Let's analyze which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Calculate the total number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 3: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$
- Node 4: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 5: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 7: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Summing these up: \(4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
