Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8. So, node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7. Node 1 cannot form any 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 7. Node 2 cannot form any 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8. So, node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6. So, node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7. Node 5 cannot form any 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7. So, node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8. So, node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7. So, node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 24 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
