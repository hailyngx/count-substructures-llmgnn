Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph and their connections can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to node 4.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 10 + 1] = 12 \).

List of unique 3-stars:
- <2, (4, 9, 5)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <4, (7, 9, 2)>
- <4, (7, 9, 3)>
- <4, (9, 2, 3)>
- <4, (9, 7, 2)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 3)>
- <9, (4, 7, 2)>
- <9, (4, 7, 3)>
