Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 has neighbors 3.
- Node 8 has neighbors 0 and 9.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-star (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (as it has only 2 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \([1]\)

Therefore, the unique 3-star found in this graph is: 
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
