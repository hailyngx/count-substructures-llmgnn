Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 8, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( C(4,3) = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( C(3,3) = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( C(2,3) = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( C(2,3) = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( C(2,3) = 0 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 = 5.

So, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (6, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
