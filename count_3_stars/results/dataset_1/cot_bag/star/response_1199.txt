Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the description, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11 \).

Thus, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (5, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>.
