Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 4.

Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 4)> <0, (2, 3, 5)> <0, (2, 4, 5)> <0, (3, 4, 5)>
