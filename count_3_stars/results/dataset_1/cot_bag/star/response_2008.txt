Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the edge list:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5
- Node 5 is connected to node 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to node 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us [1 + 1] = 2.

The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 6, 2)> and <6, (1, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
