Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Letâ€™s calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 = 34
  
Therefore, the final answer is [34].
  
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
