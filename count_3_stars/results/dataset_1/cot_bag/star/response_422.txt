Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 3
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 6

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars gives: 
\[ [4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [34] \]

The unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>
