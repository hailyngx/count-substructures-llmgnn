Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Total number of 3-stars with node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 0: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>

Node 2:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Total number of 3-stars with node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 2: <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 7:
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Total number of 3-stars with node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 10] = [18] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>
