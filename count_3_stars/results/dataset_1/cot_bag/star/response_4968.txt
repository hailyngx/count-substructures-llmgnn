Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 0.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 4.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 5.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 28 \]

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 28. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
