Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's find which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 8)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 7)
Node 3: 2 neighbors (4, 8)
Node 4: 2 neighbors (3, 8)
Node 6: 2 neighbors (0, 1)
Node 7: 2 neighbors (1, 8)
Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7)

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 = 6].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
