Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Node 0: Degree = 3
Node 1: Degree = 5
Node 2: Degree = 4
Node 3: Degree = 4
Node 4: Degree = 5
Node 6: Degree = 3
Node 7: Degree = 4

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
