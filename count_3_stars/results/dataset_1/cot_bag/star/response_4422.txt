Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in.

Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 0), (8, 0) -> 1 3-star formed with node 0 as the center, <0, (1, 8)>
Node 1: (0, 1), (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 0), (5, 1), (9, 1) -> 1 3-star formed with node 1 as the center, <1, (0, 5, 9)>
Node 5: (1, 5), (3, 5), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (8, 5) -> 1 3-star formed with node 5 as the center, <5, (1, 3, 8)>
Node 7: (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 7), (9, 7) -> 1 3-star formed with node 7 as the center, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
Node 9: (1, 9), (3, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7) -> 1 3-star formed with node 9 as the center, <9, (1, 3, 6, 7)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
[1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
