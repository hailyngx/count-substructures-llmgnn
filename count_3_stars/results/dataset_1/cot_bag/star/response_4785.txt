Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph has the following nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 6 is connected to node 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to node 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

Thus, the final answer is [10].
