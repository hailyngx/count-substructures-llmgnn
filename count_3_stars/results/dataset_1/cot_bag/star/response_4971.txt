Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 3: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-star
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>
