Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Applying the conditions for a 3-star graph, we see that node 1, node 4, node 5, node 6, and node 8 have 3 or more neighbors. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
