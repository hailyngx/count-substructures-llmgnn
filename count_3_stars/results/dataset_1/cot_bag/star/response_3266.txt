Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
