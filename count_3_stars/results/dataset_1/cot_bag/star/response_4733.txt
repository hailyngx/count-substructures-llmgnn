Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \).

So, the final answer is: [9]
And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>
