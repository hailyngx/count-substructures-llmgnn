Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

Node 0: 1, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 5
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 4, 5
Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars using inom{n}{3}:

Node 1 has inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3 has inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4 has inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5 has inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6 has inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9 has inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
