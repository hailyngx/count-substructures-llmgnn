Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 5
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3
- Node 8 neighbors: 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: C(6, 3) = 20
- Node 7: C(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 20 + 1] = 32

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
