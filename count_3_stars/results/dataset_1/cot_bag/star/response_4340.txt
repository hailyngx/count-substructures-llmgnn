Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

                   0 ---- 5
                    \      |
                     \     |
                       7  /
                       /
                   1 -- 4
                    |  / | \
                    | /  |  \
                   6 ---- 3 -- 8
                             |
                             |
                             9

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, so C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: 5 neighbors, so C(5,3) = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, so C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star
- Node 8: 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 9: 1 neighbor, not enough for a 3-star

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 24 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 3, 6)>
<4, (5, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>

<5, (1, 4, 3)>
<5, (3, 4, 1)>
