Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To visualize the graph and find the number of 3-stars, let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 8

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
