Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we will represent the graph with 10 nodes and the given 24 edges. 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars around those nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, there are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
