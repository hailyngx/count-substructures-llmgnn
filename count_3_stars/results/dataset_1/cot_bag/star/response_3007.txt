Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph:

```
    0 - 1
    |   |
3 - 4 - 5
| / | / |
6 - 7 - 8
|
9
```

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of those nodes.

- Node 3 has 8 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed = \( 56 + 35 + 20 = 111 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [111] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>.
