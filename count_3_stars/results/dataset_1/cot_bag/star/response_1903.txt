Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the 3-stars, let's first write down the degrees of each node:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- For Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
   - <1, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <1, (2, 5, 6)>

- For Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
   - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <3, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (0, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (1, 4, 7)>

- For Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
   - <4, (2, 7, 9)>

- For Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
   - <9, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <9, (4, 5, 2)>
   - <9, (4, 5, 1)>
   - <9, (5, 8, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars formed: [4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [13]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<4, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 2)>, <9, (4, 5, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>
