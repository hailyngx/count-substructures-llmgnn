Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 26 edges in the provided graph. Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8.

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 1:
- <1, (2, 9, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, 3)>

For Node 2:
- <2, (1, 9, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 4)>
- <2, (1, 8, 7)>

For Node 8:
- <8, (1, 9, 2)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 3)>
- <8, (1, 9, 5)>
- <8, (2, 1, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 1)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 1)>

There are a total of [11] 3-stars in the provided graph as listed above.
