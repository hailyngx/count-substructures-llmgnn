Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find:
- For nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each, resulting in \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 5 and 6, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each, resulting in \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [24 + 2] = 26 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, and <6, (0, 5, 9)>.
