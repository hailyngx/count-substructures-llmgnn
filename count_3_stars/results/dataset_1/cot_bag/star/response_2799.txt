Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

0: 3, 7, 8  
1: 2, 3, 8, 9  
2: 1, 3, 6, 7  
3: 0, 1, 2, 6  
4: 9  
5: 9  
6: 2, 3  
7: 0, 2, 9  
8: 0, 1  
9: 1, 4, 5, 7  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [18] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (3, 7, 8)>  
<1, (2, 3, 8)>  
<1, (2, 3, 9)>  
<1, (3, 6, 9)>  
<1, (3, 8, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 6)>  
<2, (1, 3, 7)>  
<2, (3, 6, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 2)>  
<3, (1, 2, 6)>  
<3, (1, 2, 7)>  
<3, (1, 6, 7)>  
<9, (1, 4, 5)>  
<9, (1, 4, 7)>  
<9, (1, 5, 7)>  
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
