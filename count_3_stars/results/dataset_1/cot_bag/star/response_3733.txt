Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: neighbors 1, 5
- Node 3: neighbors 4, 6
- Node 4: neighbors 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: neighbors 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: neighbor 0
- Node 8: neighbors 1, 5
- Node 9: neighbors 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 can form 3-stars with neighbors 4, 6, and 7. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with neighbors 2, 6, and 8. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 2 can't form a 3-star with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 can't form a 3-star with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with neighbors 0, 3, and 9. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with neighbors 2, 8, and 9. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with neighbors 0, 1, and 9, and also with neighbors 3, 4, and 9. Total 3-stars = 2
- Node 7 can't form a 3-star with only 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 can't form a 3-star with only 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 can't form a 3-star with only 2 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>
