Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: This node has 2 neighbors. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 1: This node has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6). One 3-star is formed with this node: <1, (3, 4, 6)>.

For node 3: This node has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 4). Two 3-stars are formed with this node: <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>.

For node 4: This node has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6). Two 3-stars are formed with this node: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>.

For node 5: This node has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 8). Two 3-stars are formed with this node: <5, (0, 3, 4)> <5, (3, 4, 6)>.

For node 6: This node has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 9). Two 3-stars are formed with this node: <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>.

For node 7: This node has 2 neighbors. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 8: This node has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 9). One 3-star is formed with this node: <8, (5, 7, 9)>.

For node 9: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 8). Two 3-stars are formed with this node: <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
