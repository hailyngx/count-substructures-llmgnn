Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of 3-stars with the given information:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7

Number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

[13]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
