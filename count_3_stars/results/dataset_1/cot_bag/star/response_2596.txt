Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6

So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
