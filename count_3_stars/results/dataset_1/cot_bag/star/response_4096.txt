Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

The nodes with less than 3 neighbors are eliminated from further consideration. Now, we can find the 3-stars based on the remaining nodes:

By applying the formula to each eligible node:
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 9: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 20

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
