Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 3. 

For node 0:
   - Number of 3-stars centered at node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
     - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
     - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
     - <0, (5, 1, 7)>
     - <0, (5, 3, 7)>

For node 2:
   - Number of 3-stars centered at node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Unique 3-star with node 2 as the center: 
     - <2, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 3:
   - Number of 3-stars centered at node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center:
     - <3, (0, 5, 9)>
     - <3, (5, 0, 9)>
     - <3, (5, 4, 9)>
     - <3, (5, 8, 9)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4] = 9.
