Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Based on the given edges, here are the nodes that have three or more neighbors along with their neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4}
Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

1. For Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

2. For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>

3. For Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

4. For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <3, (1, 4, 7)>

5. For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <4, (2, 3, 5)>

6. For Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

7. For Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
