Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Only connected to node 5. No 3-star formed.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9. Forms  \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>.
- Node 2: Only connected to node 7. No 3-star formed.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 7 and 8. No 3-star formed.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. Forms  \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 8)>.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 7. No 3-star formed.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1 and 4. No 3-star formed.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9. Forms  \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7. No 3-star formed.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1 and 7. No 3-star formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 10 = 15. 
So the final answer is [15].
