Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0, there will be \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 1, there will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8, there will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there will be \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 33 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars are listed below:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
