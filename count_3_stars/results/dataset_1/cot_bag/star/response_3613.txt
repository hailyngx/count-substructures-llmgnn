Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we construct the graph with the following node connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
