Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections can be represented as follows:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
   - Node 1 is connected to node 0.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of [1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 16 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
