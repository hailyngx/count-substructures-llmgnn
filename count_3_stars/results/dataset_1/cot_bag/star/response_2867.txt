Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: \{0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}. 

Let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for those nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 is missing
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (0), (6), (9)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (4, 6), (7, 9), (4, 9), (6, 7)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (3, 5, 8), (3, 9, 8), (5, 8, 9), (3, 6, 9)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 7), (2, 7, 8), (3, 7, 8), (2, 6, 7)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [13]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
