Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 19.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
