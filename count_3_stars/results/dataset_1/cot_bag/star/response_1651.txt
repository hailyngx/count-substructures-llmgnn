Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12

So, there are 12 3-stars in total. Listing them uniquely:
<[0, 3, 4], [1, 3, 7], [1, 9, 6], [3, 0, 1], [3, 6, 2], [6, 2, 7], [6, 8, 0], [6, 9, 1], [8, 6, 9], [9, 1, 7], [9, 6, 2], [9, 8, 0]>  

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
