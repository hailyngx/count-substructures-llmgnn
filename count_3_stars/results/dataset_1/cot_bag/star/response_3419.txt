Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6. It forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
  
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9. It forms 2 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)> and <6, (1, 7, 9)>.

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8. It forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 5, 8)>.

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: nodes 3 and 7. It doesn't form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 2 + 1] = [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, and <7, (1, 5, 8)>.
