Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>

- Node 6 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars (as it has exactly 2 neighbors)

- Node 7 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <7, (0, 1, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 6, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars is 8, so the final answer is [8].
