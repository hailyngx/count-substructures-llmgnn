Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>
Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>
Node 3 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with the following set of nodes: <6, (1, 3, 7)>

Putting these together, we get a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
