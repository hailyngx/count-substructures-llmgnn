Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and the given edges form the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 8), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)

To find the 3-stars, we will first find the degree of each node:
Degree(0) = 4
Degree(1) = 4
Degree(2) = 3
Degree(3) = 4
Degree(4) = 3
Degree(5) = 3
Degree(6) = 2
Degree(7) = 4
Degree(8) = 3
Degree(9) = 4

Now, we will find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
