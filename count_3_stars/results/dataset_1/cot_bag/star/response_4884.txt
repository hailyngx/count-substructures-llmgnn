Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars.
The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Consequently, the nodes that can form 3-stars are: 2, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <2, 1, 5>
- <2, 5, 1>
- <2, 5, 9>
- <2, 9, 5>
- <2, 6, 8>
- <6, 8, 0>
- <6, 8, 3>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <8, 6, 2>
- <9, 4, 6>
