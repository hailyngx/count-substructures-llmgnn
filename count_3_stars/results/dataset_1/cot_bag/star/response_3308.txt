Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's first construct the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges.

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges are: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to node 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating the 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding them up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
