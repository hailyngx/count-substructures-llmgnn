Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first. 
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, there are 7 edges connected to it, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
For node 1, there are 3 edges connected to it, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 4, there are 4 edges connected to it, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 7, there are 3 edges connected to it, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 8, there are 4 edges connected to it, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all these 3-stars gives a total of \( 35 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 45 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
