Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To start, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, summing them up (4 + 10 + 4 + 4) gives us a total of 22 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (2, 1, 3)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 0, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 0, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 0, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
