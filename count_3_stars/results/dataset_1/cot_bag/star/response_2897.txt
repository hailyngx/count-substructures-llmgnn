Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are a total of \( 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 10 + 4 = 19 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [19].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (7, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (8, 6, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 7, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 7, 6)>, 
<8, (2, 7, 6)>, 
<8, (7, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (7, 9, 2)>, 
<8, (9, 2, 7)>.
