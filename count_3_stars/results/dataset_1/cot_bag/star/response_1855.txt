Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 
Based on the given edge list, the graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Let's now find the total number of 3-stars and list them. 

The total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
