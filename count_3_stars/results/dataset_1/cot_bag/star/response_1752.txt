Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

For the calculation of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 2)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 1)>
- <8, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (4, 1, 8)>
