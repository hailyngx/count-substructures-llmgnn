Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (2, 3, 5, 6, 9) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (1, 3, 5) -> only 1 3-star
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (1, 2, 8) -> only 1 3-star
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1, 2, 9) -> only 1 3-star
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 7, 8, 9) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (1, 5, 6) -> only 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
