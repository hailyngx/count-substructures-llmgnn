Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [1 + 1 + 1] = 3.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
