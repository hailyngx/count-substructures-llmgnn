Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 5)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (Nodes 3, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 8)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (Node 7)
- Node 5: 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (Nodes 3, 5)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (Nodes 1, 7)

Now, we will find the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - <1, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 6, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   - <5, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <5, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <5, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   - <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Adding these up, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
