Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, and 7: <0, (3, 4, 7)>, brackets []
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <3, (0, 4, 7)>, brackets []
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 7: <4, (0, 3, 7)>, brackets []
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 4: <7, (0, 3, 4)>, brackets []

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
