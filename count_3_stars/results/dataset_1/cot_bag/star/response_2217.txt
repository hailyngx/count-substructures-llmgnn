Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if they form any 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8. It can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2. It can't form any 3-star.
3. Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6. It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9. It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9. It can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 4. It can't form any 3-star.
7. Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7. It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has neighbors: 6, 8. It can't form any 3-star.
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9. It can't form any 3-star.
10. Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 4, 8. It can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 29

Hence, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
