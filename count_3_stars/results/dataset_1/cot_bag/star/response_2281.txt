Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three neighbors: node 0 and node 4.

For node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7: <0, (3, 5, 7)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8: <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <4, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
