Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars around them:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars around node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars around node 0: <0, (2, 8, 9)>

- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars around node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars around node 2: 
    - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <2, (7, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars around node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars around node 4: <4, (2, 6, 9)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7)
  - Number of 3-stars around node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars around node 6: <6, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: (7, 2), (7, 9)
  - Node 7 does not form a 3-star.

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: (8, 0), (8, 2)
  - Node 8 does not form a 3-star.

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7)
  - Number of 3-stars around node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars around node 9:
    - <9, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (0, 4, 2)>
    - <9, (0, 7, 2)>
    - <9, (4, 7, 2)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 27. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 2)>, <9, (0, 7, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 2)>
