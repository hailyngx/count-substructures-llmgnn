Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<0, (1, 2, 8)>

Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>

Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<3, (2, 6, 9)>

Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10 3-stars. So, the answer is [10].
