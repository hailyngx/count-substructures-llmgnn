Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3,  (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <3, (2, 8, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 7)>

For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>

For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 4)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].
