Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: C(2,3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 2: C(2,3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 3: C(3,3) = 1
- For node 5: C(2,3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 6: C(3,3) = 1
- For node 7: C(2,3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 8: C(2,3) = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1]

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
