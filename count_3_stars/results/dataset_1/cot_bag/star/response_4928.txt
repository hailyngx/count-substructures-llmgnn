Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [\binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3}] = [4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [28] \]

Therefore, there are 28 total 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
