Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9): \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star each
- Total 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
