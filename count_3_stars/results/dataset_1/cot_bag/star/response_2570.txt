Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5. 

Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 3.  
Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 4.  
Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 7.  

Node 5 forms 1 3-star with nodes 6 and 5.  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 3 + 3 + 1] = [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 5)>
