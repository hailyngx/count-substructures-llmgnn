Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5}

Using the method described earlier, we find the number of 3-stars each node contributes:
- Node 0 contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 contributes 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of [20] 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
