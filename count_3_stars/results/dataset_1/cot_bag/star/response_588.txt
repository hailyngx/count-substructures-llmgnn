Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first organize the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 1 and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 1 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 1 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 2 and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars from the above calculations, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final result is [13] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 8, 7)>
- <9, (8, 7, 3)>
- <9, (8, 7, 1)>
