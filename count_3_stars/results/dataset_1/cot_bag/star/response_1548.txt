Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine where 3-stars can form. 

- Node 0: Connected to 4 nodes (2, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 2: Connected to 5 nodes (0, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 3: Connected to 4 nodes (1, 2, 6, 7)
- Node 4: Connected to 4 nodes (0, 1, 2, 6)
- Node 6: Connected to 5 nodes (0, 3, 4, 7, 9)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32]. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>
