Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

For node 0: 
- There are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 2:
- There are 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 3:
- There are 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 8)>

For node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9:
- These nodes each have at least 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars = [15]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>
