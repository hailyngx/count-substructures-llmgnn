Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 22 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [22], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 8, 2)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 7, 1)>
