Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. For each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we'll apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars with that node as the center.

- Node 1: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star
- Node 6: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
