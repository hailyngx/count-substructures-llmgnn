Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star formed (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 4, 7)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (4, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (7, 8, 9)

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars. The total number of 3-stars is [4].  
The unique 3-stars are:  <1, 4, 7>, <4, 8, 9>, <6, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 9>.
