Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 7
Node 2: 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 4, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 5
Node 7: 0, 1, 2
Node 8: 2, 4, 5
Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
