Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 46 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [46]. 

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
