Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. 

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 3, 6

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

So, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
