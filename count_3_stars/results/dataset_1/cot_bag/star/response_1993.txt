Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 5)>
