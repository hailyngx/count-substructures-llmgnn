Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8 (Total: 5)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7 (Total: 4)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8 (Total: 5)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8 (Total: 4)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - <2, (1, 3, 4)>
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (3, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (4, 6, 8)>
  
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
  
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 4, 8)>
  
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - <9, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <9, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <9, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
  
Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
