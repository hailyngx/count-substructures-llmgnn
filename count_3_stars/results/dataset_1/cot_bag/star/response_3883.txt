Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 3-stars. 

List of unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 1, 4)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 4, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 1, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
