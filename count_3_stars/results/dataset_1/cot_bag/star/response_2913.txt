Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

So, we will only consider nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 when counting the number of 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For Node 5:
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

For Node 6:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For Node 7:
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For Node 8:
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 4)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (8, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 2)>
<7, (6, 2, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
