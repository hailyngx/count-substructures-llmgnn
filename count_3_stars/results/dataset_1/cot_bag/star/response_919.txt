Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)   (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)   (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [23] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
