Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (0, 4): No 3-stars
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (5, 9): No 3-stars
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (6, 8): No 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (6, 9): No 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5): [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <8, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9): [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 11 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
