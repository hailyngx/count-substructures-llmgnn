Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 9, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- <5, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (4, 9, 6)>
- <5, (9, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
