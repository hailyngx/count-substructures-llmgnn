Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Let's now find the 3-stars. Starting with each node that has three or more neighbors:

For node 1: 
- There are 6 choose 3 = 20 possible 3-stars.

For node 6:
- There are 5 choose 3 = 10 possible 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [20 + 10] = [30].

Therefore, the final answer is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)> 

- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
