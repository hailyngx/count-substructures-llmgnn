Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes have the following neighbors:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor (node 8).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6).
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (node 5).
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6, 9).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5, 8).
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 8).
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (node 8).
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 5).

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars based on this information.

For node 1:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 3:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 4:
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>

For node 5:
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 8:
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 32, so the final answer is [32].
