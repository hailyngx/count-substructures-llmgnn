Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (4, 5)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 7)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (2, 8)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (2, 6)
- Node 6: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (3, 6)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (0, 6)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these together, we get a total of 38 3-stars in this graph.
So, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>
