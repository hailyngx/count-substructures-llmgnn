Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

So, we can see that only nodes 6 and 7 have three or more neighbors, making them potential centers for 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <6, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <6, (3, 4, 7)>
3. <6, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
5. <6, (7, 8, 9)>
