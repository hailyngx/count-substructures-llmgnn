Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 8), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 7), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 2), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 9, 2)>
