Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  

- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 8, 9  
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5  
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Adding these up:  
\[ [1 + 1 + 4] = [6] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (3, 8, 9)>  
<3, (0, 2, 5)>  
<5, (1, 3, 4)>  
<5, (3, 4, 6)>  
<5, (3, 4, 6)>  
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
