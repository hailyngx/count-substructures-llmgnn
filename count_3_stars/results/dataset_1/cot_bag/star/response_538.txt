Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>

2. Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>

3. Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>

4. Node 4: <4, (1, 7, 9)>

5. Node 5: <5, (2, 6, 9)>

6. Node 8: <8, (2, 6, 7)>

Based on the above combinations, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
