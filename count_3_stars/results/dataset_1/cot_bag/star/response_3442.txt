Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8 -> 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 2.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8 -> 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8 -> 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6 -> 1 3-star.

Thus, there are 3 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 7, 8)>
2. <5, (2, 6, 8)>
3. <6, (5, 7, 8)>
