Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 3 possible 3-stars formed around node 0. 
- Node 2: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars formed around node 2.
- Node 6: There are 3 possible 3-stars formed around node 6.
- Node 9: There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars formed around node 9.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 3 + 10 + 3 + 10 = 26 \) 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 8)>.
