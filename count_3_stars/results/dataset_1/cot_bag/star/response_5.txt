Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<0, (2, 5, 9)>,
<1, (0, 2, 6)>,
<2, (0, 4, 6)>,
<2, (1, 4, 6)>,
<2, (5, 6, 9)>,
<5, (2, 6, 9)>,
<6, (0, 1, 2)>,
<6, (0, 3, 5)>fair
