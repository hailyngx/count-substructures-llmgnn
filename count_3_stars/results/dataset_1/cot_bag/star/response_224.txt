Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look at each node with three or more neighbors. Then, we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around that node.

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 1:  3 neighbors (4, 5, 8)
  - Total 3-stars from Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4:  2 neighbors (1, 3)
- Node 5:  4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 8)
  - Total 3-stars from Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 8:  3 neighbors (1, 5, 9)
  - Total 3-stars from Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9:  3 neighbors (0, 2, 8)
  - Total 3-stars from Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we have a total of 7 3-stars in the graph. 
Thus, the final result is [7].
