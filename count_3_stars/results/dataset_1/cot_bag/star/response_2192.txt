Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, and 8. 

For node 0, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 4, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 5, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 25. 

So, the final answer is [25]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>.
