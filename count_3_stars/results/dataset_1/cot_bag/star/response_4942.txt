Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [19]. 

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, 2, 9>,  
<1, 3, 4>,  
<1, 3, 5>,  
<1, 3, 9>,  
<2, 6, 9>,  
<3, 6, 7>,  
<3, 8, 5>,  
<6, 0, 8>,  
<8, 0, 9>,  
<9, 1, 2>.
