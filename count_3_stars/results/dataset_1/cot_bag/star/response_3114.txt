Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 9  
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \)  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [20].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<3, (5, 6, 8)>  
<3, (5, 6, 9)>  
<3, (5, 8, 9)>  
<4, (1, 8, 9)>  
<4, (5, 8, 9)>  
<5, (3, 4, 9)>  
<8, (3, 4, 9)>  
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
