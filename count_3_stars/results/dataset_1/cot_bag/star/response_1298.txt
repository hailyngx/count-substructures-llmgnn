Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Let's construct the graph based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Next, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
