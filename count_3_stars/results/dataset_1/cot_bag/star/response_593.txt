Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. In this case, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8. 

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 10 + 0 + 1] = 12 \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
