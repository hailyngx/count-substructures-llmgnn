Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed using the formula mentioned earlier. Let's calculate it for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 35

So, there are 35 3-stars in this graph, and they are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [35].
