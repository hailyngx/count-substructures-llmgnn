Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first create a list of the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbors 2, 3, and 7.

We can now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <8, (2, 3, 7)>

In total, there are 9 3-stars in this graph: [9].
