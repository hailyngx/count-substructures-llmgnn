Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 2)
Node 1: (1, 3)
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 9)
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6)
Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 9)
Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 8)
Node 6: (6, 3)
Node 7: (7, 5)
Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9)
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5] \]

List of unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>, <9, (4, 8, 2)>
