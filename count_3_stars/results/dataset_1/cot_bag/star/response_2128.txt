Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Three-stars: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].
