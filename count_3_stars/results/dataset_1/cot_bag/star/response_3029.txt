Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>
