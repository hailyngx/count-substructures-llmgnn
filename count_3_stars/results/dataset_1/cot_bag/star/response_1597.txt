Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, we need to count the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's start by analyzing the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 7.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 6.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 9.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 0.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 7.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 8.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 6.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 3.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed at each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star) -> <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (no 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (no 3-star)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star) -> <7, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2, and they are <0, (2, 4, 5)> and <7, (1, 5, 7)>.
So, the answer is [2].
