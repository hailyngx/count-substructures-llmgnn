Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
