Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 2

Now we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \([10 + 4 + 4] = [18]\).

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 5)>
- <2, (1, 9, 5)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 9, 8)>
- <2, (8, 9, 5)>
- <2, (8, 5, 9)>
- <2, (9, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
