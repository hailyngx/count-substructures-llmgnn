Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0: It has only 1 neighbor (node 5), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1: It has 1 neighbor (node 4), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 2 as the center node: <2, (4, 5, 6)>.
- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 5). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 4 as the center node: <4, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 4, 5). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 5 as the center node: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 4, 2)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>.
- Node 6: It has only 1 neighbor (node 2), so no 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6.
So, the final answer is [6].
