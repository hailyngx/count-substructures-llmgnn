Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
With the given graph, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 3)>
<7, (6, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)> 

So, the final answer is: [18].
