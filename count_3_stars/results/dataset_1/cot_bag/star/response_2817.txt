Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will first visualize the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 3)

Let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: Has 1 neighbor (Node 3). No 3-star formed.
- Node 1: Has 1 neighbor (Node 3). No 3-star formed.
- Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 7, 8). There are 1 3-star.
- Node 3: Has 5 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 4, 9). There are 10 3-stars.
- Node 4: Has 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 3, 7). There are 1 3-star.
- Node 6: Has 1 neighbor (Node 8). No 3-star formed.
- Node 7: Has 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 4, 8). There are 1 3-star.
- Node 8: Has 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 6, 7). There are 1 3-star.
- Node 9: Has 1 neighbor (Node 3). No 3-star formed.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 13
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
