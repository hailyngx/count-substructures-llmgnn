Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 0), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 9), (9, 7)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 5. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9. Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 0 neighbors.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 1 + 1] = [3]

Unique 3-stars in the graph: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>
