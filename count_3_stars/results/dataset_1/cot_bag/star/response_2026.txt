Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 3 + 3 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
