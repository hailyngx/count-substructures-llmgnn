Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we need to determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: Degree 4 (Neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9)
Node 1: Degree 2 (Neighbors: 0, 2)
Node 2: Degree 3 (Neighbors: 1, 3, 6)
Node 3: Degree 2 (Neighbors: 2, 6)
Node 4: Degree 2 (Neighbors: 5, 9)
Node 5: Degree 3 (Neighbors: 0, 4, 8)
Node 6: Degree 3 (Neighbors: 2, 3, 7)
Node 7: Degree 1 (Neighbor: 6)
Node 8: Degree 3 (Neighbors: 0, 5, 9)
Node 9: Degree 3 (Neighbors: 0, 4, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are found to be:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
