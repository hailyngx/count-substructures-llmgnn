Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
Total = 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 35 = 109

Therefore, there are a total of [109] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
