Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20 + 4 = 24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
