Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Combining all the 3-stars generated by each node gives us a total of [4+4+4+4+4] = 20 3-stars.

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, 1, 2>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 7>
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 6, 7>
<2, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 8> 

So, the final answer is [20].
