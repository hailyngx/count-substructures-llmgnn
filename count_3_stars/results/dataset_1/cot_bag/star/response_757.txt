Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Let's now find the total number of 3-stars in this graph and list the unique 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = [9]    
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
