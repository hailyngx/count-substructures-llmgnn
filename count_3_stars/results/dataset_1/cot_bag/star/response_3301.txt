Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 4, 7. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, 8. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 8, 9. <5, (6, 8, 9)>

There are [3] 3-stars in this graph.
