Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 2), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 5}
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {6, 7, 8}
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 5, 7}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 9}
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {2, 9}
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {2, 4}
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {5, 6}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed around the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 13.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
