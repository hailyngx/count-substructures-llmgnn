Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 26 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>.
