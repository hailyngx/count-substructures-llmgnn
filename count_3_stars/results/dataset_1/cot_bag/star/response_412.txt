Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```plaintext
      2----7
     /|   /|
    3-|----4
    | |  | |
    |/   |/
    6----1
    |     
    0     
    |
    9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
  
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
  - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
  - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
  - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (3, 5, 7)>
  
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (2, 3, 4)>
  - <7, (2, 3, 6)>
  - <7, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <7, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [19] \) and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
