Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors since those are the only ones that can form 3-stars. Nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 meet this criterion. Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: No 3-star formed with 3 neighbors
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of 13 3-stars. So, the final answer is [13].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 5, 2)>
