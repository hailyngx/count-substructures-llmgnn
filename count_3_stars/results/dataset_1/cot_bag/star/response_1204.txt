Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's analyze each node:

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 8.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Considering only nodes with three or more neighbors, we can form 4 3-stars in total:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
