Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. In this case, nodes 5 and 7 have 3 or more neighbors.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 4, 9
- This forms one 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 3, 8
- This forms another 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
