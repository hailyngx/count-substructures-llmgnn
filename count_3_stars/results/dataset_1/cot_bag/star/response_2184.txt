Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first examine each node to see how many neighbors it has:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

We can see that only nodes 1, 3, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, which means they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 4 = 12].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [12].
