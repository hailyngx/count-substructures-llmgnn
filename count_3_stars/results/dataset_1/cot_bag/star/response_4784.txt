Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 33

Hence, there are 33 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [10].
