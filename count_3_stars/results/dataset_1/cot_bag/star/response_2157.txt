Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 4), (9, 1), (9, 5)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 4, 9}

For node 1:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]
So, there are 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
\[
\binom{3}{3} = 1
\]
So, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center:
<4, (1, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
\[
\binom{3}{3} = 1
\]
So, there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center:
<5, (1, 4, 9)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of 6 3-stars:
