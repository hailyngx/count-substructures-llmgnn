Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 4, node 6, and node 9.

For node 0:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 4:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<0, (7, 3, 9)>
<0, (8, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 0, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 0, 9)>
<6, (5, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 4)>
<9, (4, 6, 0)>
