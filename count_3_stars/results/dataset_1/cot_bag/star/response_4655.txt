Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 29 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
