Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [13] \). 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 4)>
- <3, (6, 4, 9)>
- <3, (6, 9, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
