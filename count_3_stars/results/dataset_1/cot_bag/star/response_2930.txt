Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 2: Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5: Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 5 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars involving node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 2, 5)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
