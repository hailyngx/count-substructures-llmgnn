Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [3]
- Node 2: [3]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [4]
- Node 9: [3]

Adding up all the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of [16]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 2, 9)>
- <1, (4, 1, 8)>
- <2, (5, 2, 6)>
- <2, (9, 3, 8)>
- <2, (6, 9, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (8, 2, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [16].
