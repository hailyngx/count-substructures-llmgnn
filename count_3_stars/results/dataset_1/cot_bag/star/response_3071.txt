Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   6   7
    \ / \
     0   4
          \
           9
```

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to check each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 7. So, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with node 0 as the center.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 9. So, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, and node 9 has 1 neighbor, so they do not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>.
