Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 have more than three neighbors.

We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 5, 7)>
- <1, (7, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 0, 4)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 7, 3)>
- <9, (2, 7, 3)>
- <9, (3, 0, 7)>
- <9, (3, 7, 0)>
- <9, (7, 2, 3)>
- <9, (7, 3, 0)>
- <9, (7, 3, 2)>
