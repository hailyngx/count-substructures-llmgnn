Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: (5, 6, 7, 8)  
Node 2: (3, 5, 6, 7, 8)  
Node 6: (0, 2, 5, 7, 8)  
Node 7: (0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9)  
Node 8: (0, 2, 6, 9)  
Node 9: (7, 8)  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 48 \)  

So, there are 48 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (5, 6, 7)>  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<0, (5, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<2, (3, 5, 6)>  
<2, (5, 6, 7)>  
<2, (5, 6, 8)>  
<2, (5, 7, 8)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>  
<6, (0, 2, 5)>  
<6, (0, 5, 7)>  
<6, (0, 5, 8)>  
<6, (2, 5, 7)>  
<6, (2, 5, 8)>  
<6, (5, 7, 8)>  
<7, (0, 2, 3)>  
<7, (0, 2, 6)>  
<7, (2, 3, 7)>  
<7, (2, 6, 7)>  
<7, (3, 6, 7)>  
<8, (0, 2, 6)>  
<8, (0, 6, 9)>  
<8, (2, 6, 9)>  
<8, (6, 7, 9)>  

This list contains all unique 3-stars in the graph.
