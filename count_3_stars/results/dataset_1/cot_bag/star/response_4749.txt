Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7.

Now, let's analyze each node to find the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - <4, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    - <6, (3, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node, we have a total of 10 3-stars in this graph. So, the final count within brackets is [10].
