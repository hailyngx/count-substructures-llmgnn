Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 6
|     |
|     |
5 --- 8 --- 7 --- 1 --- 2 --- 4 --- 9
```

We see that node 8 is the only node that has more than 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
So, there are 4 total 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are: <8, (5, 7, 1)>, <8, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 1, 2)>, <8, (7, 1, 2)>.
