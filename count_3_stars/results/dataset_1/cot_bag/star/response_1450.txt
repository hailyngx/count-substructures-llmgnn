Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed as follows:

Node 0: 1, 5, 9
Node 1: 0
Node 2: 7, 9
Node 4: 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 7, 9
Node 6: 9
Node 7: 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 4, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
<0, (1, 5, 9)>

Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0

Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
<4, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
<5, (0, 7, 9)>

Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
<7, (2, 4, 5)>

Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
<9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 9, 6)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 9, 6)>, <9, (7, 5, 9)>, <9, (7, 2, 9)>

Therefore, we have a total of [1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20] = 24 3-stars in the given graph.
