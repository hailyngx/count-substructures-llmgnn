Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 7, 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 7
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 0, 3, 8
Node 8: 0, 7
Node 9: 2

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Now let's sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\(4 + 1 + 1 = 6\)

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 8, 3)>
<7, (8, 0, 3)> 

So, the final answer is [6].
