Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Applying the method described earlier:
Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 9

So the answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 3)>, <8, (3, 7, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 1)>.
