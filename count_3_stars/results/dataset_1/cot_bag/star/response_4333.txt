Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- For node 1: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
- For node 4: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 7: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 8: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star

Adding these up: \(1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 7, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 8, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 8, 1)>
- <0, (4, 7, 1)>
- <1, (4, 8, 7)>
- <7, (4, 9, 1)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 2)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 2, 1)>
