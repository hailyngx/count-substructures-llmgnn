Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.

Let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3, 5, and 6 also have 4 neighbors each, so each of them can form 4 3-stars.
- No other node has 3 or more neighbors, so we don't consider them for forming 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) = 16

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>.
