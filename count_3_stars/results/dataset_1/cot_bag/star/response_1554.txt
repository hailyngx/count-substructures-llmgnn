Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 4  
Node 1: 3, 7, 8  
Node 2: 4, 8, 9  
Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9  
Node 4: 0, 2, 3  
Node 5: 7, 8  
Node 7: 1, 3, 5  
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9  
Node 9: 2, 3, 8  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed  
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed  
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed  
For node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars formed  
For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars formed  
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed  
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed  
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 24  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (3, 7, 8)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (1, 4, 7)>  
<3, (1, 4, 8)>  
<3, (1, 7, 8)>  
<3, (2, 8, 9)>  
<3, (3, 7, 8)>  
<3, (3, 8, 9)>  
<3, (4, 8, 9)>  
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
