Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 4)>
<5, (4, 7, 0)>
<9, (3, 0, 6)>
<9, (3, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 3)>
