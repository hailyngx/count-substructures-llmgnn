Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 48 \).

So, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>
