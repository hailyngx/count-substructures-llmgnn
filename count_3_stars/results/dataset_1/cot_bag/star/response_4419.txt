Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \(1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15\).

So, the final answer is [15].
And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
