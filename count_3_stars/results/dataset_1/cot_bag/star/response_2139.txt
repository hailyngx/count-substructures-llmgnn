Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, node 4 has 6 neighbors, node 5 has 3 neighbors, node 6 has 5 neighbors, and node 9 has 4 neighbors.  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([ 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 ] = [39]\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>
