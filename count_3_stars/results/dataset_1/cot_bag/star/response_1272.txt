Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 2: Neighbors are 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 5: Neighbors are 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6: Neighbors are 1, 3, and 8.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (3, 5, 8)>
- <5, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
