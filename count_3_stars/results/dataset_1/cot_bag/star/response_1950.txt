Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Checking the degree of each node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [37] \]

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
