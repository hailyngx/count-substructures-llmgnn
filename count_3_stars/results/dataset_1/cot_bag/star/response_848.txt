Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. In this case, nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

So, the final answer is [4].
