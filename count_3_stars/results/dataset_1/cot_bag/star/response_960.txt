Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first represent the nodes and their connections visually:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 8
- 1 is connected to 2 and 9
- 2 is connected to 1 and 9
- 3 is connected to 4, 6, and 9
- 4 is connected to 3
- 5 is connected to 7 and 8
- 6 is connected to 3 and 8
- 7 is connected to 5, 8, and 9
- 8 is connected to 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9
- 9 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8

Now, we identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 8, 9

For node 3: 
- The neighbors are 4, 6, and 9
- There is 1 3-star formed: <3, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 8:
- The neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed: <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 9:
- The neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed: <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars observed is 1 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 9) = 21.

Thus, the answer is [21].
