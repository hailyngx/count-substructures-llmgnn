Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 4)>
<4, (0, 9, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (7, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
