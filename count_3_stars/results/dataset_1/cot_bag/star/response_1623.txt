Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in the graph, numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 9}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 54 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
