Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: inom{3}{2} = 3. The 3-stars are <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 4)>, and <2, (8, 9, 4)>.
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1. The 3-star is <3, (5, 6, 7)>.
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1. The 3-star is <4, (5, 8, -)>.
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1. The 3-star is <5, (3, 4, 7)>.
- Node 8: inom{3}{2} = 3. The 3-stars are <8, (2, 0, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, and <8, (2, 4, 5)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have [3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3] = 9 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the result is [9].
