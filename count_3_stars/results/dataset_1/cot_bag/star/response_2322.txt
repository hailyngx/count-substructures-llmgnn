Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 2
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 2
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3} + inom{5}{3}] = 10

Summing these up, we get 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of 16 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>
