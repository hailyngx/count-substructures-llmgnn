Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 1, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 1, as it has 2 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 6, it has 2 neighbors as well, so no 3-star is formed.

For node 8, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 9, which also has 4 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars are <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 1)>, <9, (6, 1, 8)>, and <9, (1, 8, 3)>.
