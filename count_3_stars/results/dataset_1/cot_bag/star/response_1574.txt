Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Here is the list of nodes along with their number of neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>.
