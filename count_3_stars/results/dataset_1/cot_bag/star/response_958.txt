Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 27 3-stars. So, the final answer is [27].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
