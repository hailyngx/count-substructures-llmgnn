Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we can visualize the graph with its nodes and edges.  

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at each node that has at least 3 neighbors and applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \). If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with that node as the center.

Let's identify and calculate the total number of 3-stars:  

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors

Calculating for Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as center  
Calculating for Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 4 as center  
Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 = 14 \)  

Therefore, there are 14 3-stars in the given graph.  
Listing the unique 3-stars:  
<1, (0, 2, 8)>  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>  
<1, (4, 8, 9)>  
<4, (1, 2, 3)>  
<4, (1, 2, 7)>  
<4, (1, 3, 8)>  
<4, (1, 7, 8)>  
<4, (2, 3, 7)>  
<4, (2, 8, 9)>  
<4, (3, 7, 8)>  
<4, (7, 8, 9)>  

Putting the final count in brackets, we have:  
[14]
