Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first analyze each node to see if it forms any 3-stars.

Node 0: Forms 1 3-star.
<0, (2, 3, 1)>

Node 1: Forms 1 3-star.
<1, (2, 3, 7)>

Node 2: Forms 3 3-stars.
<2, (0, 3, 1)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>

Node 3: Forms 3 3-stars.
<3, (0, 2, 1)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>

Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
<4, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 5: Forms 3 3-stars.
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 9, 8)>

Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.

Node 7: Forms 1 3-star.
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 8: Forms 2 3-stars.
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>

Node 9: Forms 1 3-star.
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 15. Therefore, the answer is [15].
