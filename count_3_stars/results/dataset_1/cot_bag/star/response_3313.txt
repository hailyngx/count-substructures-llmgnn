Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars: nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 

In <> notation, the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 0, 9)>, <3, (4, 9, 7)>, <3, (9, 7, 0)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
