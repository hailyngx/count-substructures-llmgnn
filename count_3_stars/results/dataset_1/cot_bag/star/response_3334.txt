Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
- It has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 7, 8).
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 2: 
- It has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8).
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 4: 
- It has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 6, 9).
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 5: 
- It has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 6).
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>

For node 8: 
- It has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 9).
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>

For node 9: 
- It has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, 8).
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for all these nodes: 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].
