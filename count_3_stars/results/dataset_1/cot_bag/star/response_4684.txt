Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (1, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15. So, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>
