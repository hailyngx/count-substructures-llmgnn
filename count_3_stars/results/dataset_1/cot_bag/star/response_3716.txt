Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
We'll list the nodes and their neighbors first to better understand the graph:

- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: Since it has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star. <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: Also has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: Has 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars. <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 16. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>
