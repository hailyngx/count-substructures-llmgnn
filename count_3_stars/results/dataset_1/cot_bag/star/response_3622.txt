Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify which nodes have at least 3 neighbors.

From the provided edges, we can see that:  
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors  
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 7 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors  

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
For Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars  
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:  
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 4] = [43] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, 5, 7>  
<3, 1, 7>  
<4, 7, 5>  
<5, 7, 1>  
<7, 5, 4>  
<7, 3, 1>  
<7, 4, 5>  
<9, 4, 3>
