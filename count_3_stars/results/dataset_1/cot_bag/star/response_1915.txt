Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>
  
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <5, (2, 6, 9)>
  
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <6, (0, 5, 9)>
  
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>
  
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
