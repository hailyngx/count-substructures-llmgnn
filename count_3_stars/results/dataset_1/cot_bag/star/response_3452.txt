Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's find the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 3, 5). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 4, 8). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5, 9). Only 1 3-star can be formed: <2, (0, 5, 9)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 4, 7). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 7, 8, 9). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (0, 2, 6). Only 1 3-star can be formed: <5, (0, 2, 6)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 9). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (2, 4, 6, 8). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 3-stars: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 32\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
