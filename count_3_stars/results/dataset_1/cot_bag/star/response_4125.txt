Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 3, 5
Node 1: 3, 7
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 4, 7
Node 6: 3, 8
Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 6, 7
Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [3-stars = inom{2}{3} = 0]
- Node 1: [3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 2: [3-stars = inom{0}{3} = 0]
- Node 3: [3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10]
- Node 4: [3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 5: [3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 6: [3-stars = inom{1}{3} = 0]
- Node 7: [3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4]
- Node 8: [3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1]
- Node 9: [3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [0 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 25.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

So, the final answer is [25].
