Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these central nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, and <8, (1, 3, 4)>.
