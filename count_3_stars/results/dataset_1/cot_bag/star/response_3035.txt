Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph using the given information:

The graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0,8), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,8), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,1), (3,2), (3,6), (3,8), (4,1), (4,5), (5,2), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,5), (7,2), (7,9), (8,0), (8,1), (8,3), (8,5), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 7), (9, 8)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 8: C(5, 3) = 10

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 30. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (8, 9, 0)>
- <8, (8, 9, 1)>
- <8, (8, 9, 3)>
- <8, (8, 9, 5)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
