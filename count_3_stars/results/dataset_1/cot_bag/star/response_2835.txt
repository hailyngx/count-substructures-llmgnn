Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 10 = 14 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 5)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
