Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
    - <3, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (8, 7, 9)>
    - <3, (0, 7, 9)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. These 3-stars are:
    - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <6, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 4, 9)>

Adding the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.
