Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
We will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the 3-stars for each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9

Calculating the 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: 
    - Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
    - Unique 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
    
- Node 3:
    - Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
    
- Node 4:
    - Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
    
- Node 5:
    - Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
    - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
    
- Node 6:
    - Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
    - Unique 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 9)>
    
- Node 9:
    - Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
    
Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [15]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 15.
