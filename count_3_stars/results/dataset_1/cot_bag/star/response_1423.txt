Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7 <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8 <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor only.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor only.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4 <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6 <8, (2, 5, 6)>

In total, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
