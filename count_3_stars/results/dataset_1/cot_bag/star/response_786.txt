Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 7
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 7

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 and Node 7 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors.

For Node 2:
There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars as it has exactly 2 neighbors (less than 3).

For Node 7:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors with nodes 2, 3, and 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1, so the final answer is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <7, (2, 3, 9)>.
