Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 2, and 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 3, 6, and 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: neighbors are 0, 3, 5, and 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: neighbors are 2, 6, 7, and 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 2, 5, and 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8: neighbors are 3, 5, and 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: neighbors are 1, 7, and 8 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [19] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
