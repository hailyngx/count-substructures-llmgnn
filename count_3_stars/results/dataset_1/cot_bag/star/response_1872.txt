Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 5, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 5, there are 6 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 7, 9). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

For node 6, there are 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 9). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

For node 9, there are 6 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 6). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding these up, there are a total of \( 20 + 10 + 20 = 50 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
