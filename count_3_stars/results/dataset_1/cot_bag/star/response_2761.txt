Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
