Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 + 1 = 70 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [70].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
