Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, here are the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 2 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each eligible node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these together, we have a total of 11 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (7, 5, 8)>
<1, (7, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
