Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {1, 2}
- 1: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- 2: {0, 5}
- 3: {5, 9}
- 4: {1, 8}
- 5: {2, 3, 8}
- 6: {1, 8}
- 7: {1, 8}
- 8: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- 9: {1, 3}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1:
- (0, 1, 4)
- (0, 1, 6)
- (0, 1, 7)
- (0, 1, 9)
- (4, 1, 6)
- (4, 1, 7)
- (4, 1, 9)
- (6, 1, 7)
- (6, 1, 9)
- (7, 1, 9)

For node 8:
- (4, 8, 5)
- (4, 8, 6)
- (4, 8, 7)
- (5, 8, 6)
- (5, 8, 7)
- (6, 8, 7)

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 15

So, the final answer is [15]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (8, 5, 6)>
- <4, (8, 5, 7)>
- <4, (8, 6, 7)>
- <5, (8, 6, 7)>
- <6, (8, 5, 7)>
- <7, (8, 5, 6)>
