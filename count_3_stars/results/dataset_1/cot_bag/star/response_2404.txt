Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: This node has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
  <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>

- Node 2: This node has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
  <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, 
  <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, 
  <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, 
  <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>

- Node 3: This node has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
  <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>

- Node 4: This node has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
  <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, 
  <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>

- Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
  <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 6: This node has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
  <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, 
  <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, 
  <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>, 
  <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 6, 7)>

- Node 7: This node has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
  <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, 
  <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>

- Node 9: This node has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.
  <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Total number of unique 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1] = 73
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <...
