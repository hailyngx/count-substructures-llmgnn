Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4  
Node 1: 3, 6, 7  
Node 2: 0, 3, 5  
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7  
Node 4: 0, 5  
Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9  
Node 6: 1, 8, 9  
Node 7: 1, 3, 9  
Node 8: 5, 6, 9  
Node 9: 5, 6, 7, 8 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)  
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)  
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)  
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)  
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)  
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)  

Adding these up, we get a total of 16 3-stars, so the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (2, 3, 4)>  
<1, (3, 6, 7)>  
<2, (0, 3, 5)>  
<3, (0, 1, 2)>  
<5, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (1, 8, 9)>  
<7, (1, 3, 9)>  
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
