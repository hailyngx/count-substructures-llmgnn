Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. 

For node 0: 
- It has 2 3-stars. 
    - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 2)>

For node 2:
- It has 3 3-stars.
    - <2, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <2, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
- It has 2 3-stars.
    - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (0, 3, 6)>

For node 6:
- It has 3 3-stars.
    - <6, (0, 2, 4)>
    - <6, (0, 2, 3)>
    - <6, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 8:
- It has 3 3-stars.
    - <8, (1, 2, 7)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <8, (5, 4, 7)>

For node 9:
- It has 1 3-star.
    - <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 14
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
