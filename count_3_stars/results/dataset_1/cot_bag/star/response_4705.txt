Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 9: 1

Next, we'll identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 each have three or more neighbors.

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For a node with \( k \) neighbors, there are \( \binom{k}{3} \) 3-stars.
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\]

Therefore, there is 1 3-star in this graph.
