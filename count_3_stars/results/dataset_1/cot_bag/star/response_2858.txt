Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes and 20 edges in this graph. 

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, and 9
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, and 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
