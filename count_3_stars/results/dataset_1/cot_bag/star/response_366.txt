Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Since node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 8), it can form 1 3-star. Therefore, <0, (5, 6, 8)>.

- Node 3: Node 3 has 5 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. Therefore, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>.

- Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6), so it can form 1 3-star. Therefore, <5, (0, 2, 6)>.

- Node 6: Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5), so it can form 1 3-star. Therefore, <6, (0, 3, 5)>.

- Node 8: Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Therefore, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>.

- Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars. Therefore, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>.

There is only one 3-star coming from each of the nodes 0, 5, 6, and multiple coming from nodes 3, 8, and 9. 

Summing up all the possible 3-stars for the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 21 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
