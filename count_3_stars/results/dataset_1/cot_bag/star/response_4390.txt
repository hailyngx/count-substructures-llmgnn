Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 9, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 8)>
