Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 59

Therefore, there are 59 unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>
