Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 9) = 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (9, 0, 4)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 9, 6)>
<4, (3, 1, 6)>
<4, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (8, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (4, 0, 2)>
<6, (4, 1, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 0, 4)>
<6, (9, 3, 1)>
<9, (0, 4, 2)>
<9, (3, 1, 6)>
<9, (6, 0, 4)>
<9, (6, 1, 3)>
