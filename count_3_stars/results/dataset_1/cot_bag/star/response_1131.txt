Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
With the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

From the degree sequence, we see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7 have 4 neighbors each and node 6 has 3 neighbors.

For node 0: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 1: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 3: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 4: 
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]

For node 7: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 6: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [20] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 3, 4>
- <0, 1, 3, 7>
- <0, 1, 4, 7>
- <0, 3, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 4, 7>
