Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, and 9.

For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 1)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
