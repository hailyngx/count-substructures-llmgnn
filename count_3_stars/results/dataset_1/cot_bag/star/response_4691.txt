Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

So, there are 33 3-stars in total in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].
