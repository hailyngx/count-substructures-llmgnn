Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's go through the nodes:
- Node 0: It has only one neighbor (node 2), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1: It has only one neighbor (node 7), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, and 9). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: It has 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 8). So, it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4: It has only one neighbor (node 7), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5: It has only one neighbor (node 8), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (nodes 7 and 9). So, it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8). So, it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, and 7). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors (nodes 2 and 6). So, it cannot form any 3-star.

In total, there are 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
