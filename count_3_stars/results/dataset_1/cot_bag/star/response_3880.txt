Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 7
Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 6, 9
Node 3: 4, 8
Node 4: 3, 5
Node 5: 1, 4
Node 6: 1, 2, 7
Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 3, 7
Node 9: 2, 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 3: 0 3-stars
Node 4: 0 3-stars
Node 5: 0 3-stars
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 7>
<1, 6, 7>
<1, 7, 8>
<1, 5, 6>
<1, 5, 7>
<7, 6, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<7, 0, 2>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 1, 6>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 6, 2>
<7, 6, 1>
<8, 1, 3>
<6, 1, 2>
<0, 7, 1>
<2, 0, 6>
<0, 7, 6>
