Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph is as follows:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (3, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Now let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

Node 0: Does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 1: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 3: Does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 4: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5: Has 2 neighbors, does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 6: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 7: Does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 8: Has 2 neighbors, does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 9: Has 2 neighbors, does not have 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 = 9
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
