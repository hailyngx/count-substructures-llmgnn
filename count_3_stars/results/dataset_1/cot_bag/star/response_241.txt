Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8. So, we have 1 3-star with node 0.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2. These 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5. These 3-stars are <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7. So, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6. These 3-stars are <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. So, we have 1 3-star with node 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14 \).
Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [14].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>.
