Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has edges with nodes {2, 4, 6}.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes {1, 8, 9}.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes {1, 5}.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes {0, 4, 9}.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes {2, 5, 7}.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4 \)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
