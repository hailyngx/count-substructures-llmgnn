Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 9 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
The 3-stars <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)> can be formed.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
The 3-star <3, (4, 5, 8)> can be formed.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
The 3-star <4, (2, 3, 6)> can be formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
