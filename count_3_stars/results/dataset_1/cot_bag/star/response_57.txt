Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can visualize it as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)
  
Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
   - Not enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 6, 9
   - Not enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9
   - Not enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8
   - Not enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 9
   - Only 1 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 6
   - Only 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 6)>
10. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 32
Therefore, the final answer is [32].
