Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the list of edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: It has 2 3-stars.
<0, (1, 9)> and <0, (1, 9)>
 
2. Node 1: It has 2 3-stars.
<1, (0, 5, 9)> and <1, (0, 5, 9)>

3. Node 4: It has 4 3-stars.
<4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, and <4, (5, 6, 8)>

4. Node 5: It has 2 3-stars.
<5, (1, 4, 6)> and <5, (1, 4, 6)>

5. Node 6: It has 2 3-stars.
<6, (4, 9, 8)> and <6, (4, 9, 8)>

6. Node 8: It has 2 3-stars.
<8, (4, 6, 9)> and <8, (4, 6, 9)>

7. Node 9: It has 2 3-stars.
<9, (0, 1, 6)> and <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of [2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2] = 16.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
