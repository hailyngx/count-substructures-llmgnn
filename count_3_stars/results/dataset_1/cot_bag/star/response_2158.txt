Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 7.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9, and 5.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 5.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 6.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 6.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 7.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 6.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 2.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
Node 2 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <2, (5, 9, 5)>.
Node 5 has inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 6)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0 + 1 + 1 = 2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (5, 9, 5)> and <5, (2, 3, 6)>.
