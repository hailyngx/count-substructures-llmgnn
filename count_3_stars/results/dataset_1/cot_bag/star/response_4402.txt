Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 56 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 98

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [98].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
