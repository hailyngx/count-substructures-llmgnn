Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, and 8. Let's first calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0 
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 

Summing these up, we get a total of [4 + 0 + 10 = 14] 3-stars in the graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
