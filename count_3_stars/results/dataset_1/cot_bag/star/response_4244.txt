Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5)
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9)
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (0, 2)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (6)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 42 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
