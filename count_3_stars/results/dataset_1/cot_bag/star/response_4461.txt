Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, here is the breakdown:  

- Node 1 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:  

- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
  
Adding these together gives a total of 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 3-stars, which means we have [6] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, 4, 7, 5>
- <2, 8, 6, 7>
- <4, 2, 7, 5>
- <6, 2, 7, 5>
- <7, 1, 4, 5>
- <7, 4, 5, 6>
