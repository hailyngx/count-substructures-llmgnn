Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way:

         0 --- 7
         |
         1 --- 6
         |     |
         8 --- 2
         
             3
         
         4 --- 5 --- 9

Now, let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars formed:

Node 0: 1 3-star
<0, (7, 8, 1)>

Node 1: 1 3-star
<1, (6, 3, 8)>

Node 2: No 3-star

Node 3: No 3-star

Node 4: 1 3-star
<4, (5, 9, 8)>

Node 5: 1 3-star
<5, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 6: No 3-star

Node 7: 1 3-star
<7, (0, 5, 8)>

Node 8: 1 3-star
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Node 9: No 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 5
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
