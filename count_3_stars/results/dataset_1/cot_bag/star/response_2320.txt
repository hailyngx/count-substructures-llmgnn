Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each central node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 39 \)

Therefore, there are 39 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)> 

So, the final result is [39].
