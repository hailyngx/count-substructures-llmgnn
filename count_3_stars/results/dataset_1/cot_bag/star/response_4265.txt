Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To identify the 3-star graphs in this network, we need to first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Let's go through the list of edges and count the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (0, 4)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (6, 7)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8)
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (7)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5)
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (4)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>
