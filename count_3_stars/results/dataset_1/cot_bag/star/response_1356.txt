Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify them first:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 6, 8
Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 3 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 0, 9)>
