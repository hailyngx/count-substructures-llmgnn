Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1] = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
