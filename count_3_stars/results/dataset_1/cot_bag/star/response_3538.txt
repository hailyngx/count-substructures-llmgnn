Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<0, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<2, (3, 4, 8)>

Node 3 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<4, (2, 5, 8)>

Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it does not form any 3-star.

Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<7, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 7), so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting all the 3-stars formed, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [14].
