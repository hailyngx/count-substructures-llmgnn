Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph. Let's examine each node to see if it can form a 3-star.

Node 0: This node has 2 neighbors (2, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 2: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 8). It can form 1 3-star. Therefore, we have 1 3-star with Node 2.

Node 3: This node has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9). It can form 1 3-star. Therefore, we have 1 3-star with Node 3.

Node 4: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 8, 9). It can form 1 3-star. Therefore, we have 1 3-star with Node 4.

Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 8). It can form 1 3-star. Therefore, we have 1 3-star with Node 5.

Node 8: This node has 2 neighbors (2, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 9: This node has 2 neighbors (3, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
