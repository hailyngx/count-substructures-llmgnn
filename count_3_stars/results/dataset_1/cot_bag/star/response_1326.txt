Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. We need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6). So there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8). So there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 7). So there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 7). So there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 8, 9). So there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9). So there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3). So there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9). So there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8). So there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars formed in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<9, (4, 6, 8)>.
