Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 0 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 0 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, 4, 7>
<3, 0, 4>
<4, 2, 7>
<6, 2, 9>
<7, 4, 9>
