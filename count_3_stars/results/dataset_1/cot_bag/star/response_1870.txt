Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the total number of 3-stars based on these nodes.

For node 0, there are 2 3-stars formed: <0, (6, 7, 9)> and <0, (6, 7, 3)>.
For node 3, there are 4 3-stars formed: <3, (4, 7, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, and <3, (4, 7, 2)>.
For node 4, there are 2 3-stars formed: <4, (3, 5, 7)> and <4, (3, 5, 8)>.
For node 5, there is 1 3-star formed: <5, (4, 8, 7)>.
For node 6, there is 1 3-star formed: <6, (0, 7, 9)>.
For node 7, there are 4 3-stars formed: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, and <7, (0, 2, 5)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 14. 

So, there are 14 3-stars in this graph.
