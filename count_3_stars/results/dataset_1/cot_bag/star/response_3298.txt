Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 7), (6, 3), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 1)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: (0, 4), (4, 0)
Node 1: (1, 8), (8, 1)
Node 2: (2, 7), (7, 2)
Node 3: (3, 6), (6, 3)
Node 4: (0, 4), (4, 7), (4, 7)
Node 7: (2, 7), (4, 7), (7, 2)
Node 8: (1, 8), (8, 1)

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star
Node 1 forms 1 3-star
Node 2 forms 1 3-star
Node 3 forms 0 3-stars
Node 4 forms 3 3-stars
Node 7 forms 3 3-stars
Node 8 forms 1 3-star

Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 2)>, <1, (8, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 7, 2)>, <7, (2, 4, 0)>, <8, (1, 8, 2)>
