Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with at least 3 neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. 

Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 3-stars.
Node 4 has 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we find a total of [12] 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 0)>
<6, (2, 0, 1)>
<6, (2, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (3, 9, 2)>
<8, (9, 3, 2)>
