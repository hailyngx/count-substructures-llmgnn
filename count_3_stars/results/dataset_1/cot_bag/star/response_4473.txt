Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
10 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 7) + 20 (from node 9) = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 9, 5)>, <0, (7, 9, 5)>, <0, (7, 9, 6)>, <0, (7, 9, 4)>, <0, (7, 9, 0)>, <0, (9, 5, 7)>, <0, (9, 6, 7)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <0, (9, 7, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 2)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 0)>, <4, (2, 0, 9)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 6)>, <9, (0, 7, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 9, 4)>, <9, (4, 0, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 0, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (9, 0, 4)>, <9, (9, 2, 4)>, <9, (9, 4, 0)>, <9, (9, 4, 5)>, <9, (9, 6, 7)>
