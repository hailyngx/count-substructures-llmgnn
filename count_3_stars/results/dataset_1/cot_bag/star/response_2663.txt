Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to determine the 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8. 
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 1
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 1
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8

Now, letâ€™s count the number of 3-stars formed. 

For each node with more than 3 neighbors, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars that can be formed. 

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 7. Hence, the answer is [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
