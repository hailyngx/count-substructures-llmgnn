Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20
So, the final answer is [20].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>
