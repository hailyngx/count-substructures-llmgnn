Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
