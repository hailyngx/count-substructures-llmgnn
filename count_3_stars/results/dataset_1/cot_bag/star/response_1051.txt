Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 1, 2, 7), so <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 3, 5, 8), so <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 4, 6, 9), so <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 6, 8, 9), so <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 7, 8, 0), so <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars (with different combinations), but we have already counted some. There are 3-stars like <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, and <8, (4, 6, 9)> that were previously counted. Therefore, we look for remaining unique 3-stars. We find 12 additional unique 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (with nodes 3, 4, 8), so <9, (3, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 12 + 1 = 33.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].
