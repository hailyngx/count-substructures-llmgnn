Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.  

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.  
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 1.  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 6.  
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 7.  
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 8.  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star with node 9.  

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 44 \) 3-stars in the graph.

So, the answer is [44].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<0, (1, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>  
<1, (0, 2, 8)>  
<2, (1, 7, 8)>  
<6, (0, 7, 9)>  
<7, (0, 2, 8)>  
<8, (0, 2, 7)>  
<8, (0, 7, 9)>  
<8, (1, 2, 7)>  
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
