Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph with 10 nodes, we need to first identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

1. Node 0: This node has 2 neighbors (nodes 4 and 6), so no 3-star can be formed.

2. Node 3: This node has 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8). 
   The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).  
   Therefore, there are 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center.  
   <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, 
   <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>.

3. Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, and 8).
   The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 3 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
   Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
   <4, (0, 3, 8)>.

4. Node 6: This node has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9).
   The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
   Therefore, there are 10 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
   <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>,
   <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>.

5. Node 7: This node has 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 6, 8, and 9).
   The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
   <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.

6. Node 8: This node has 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7).
   The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
   Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
   <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 39] unique 3-stars in the graph.
