Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (4)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (3, 8)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (3, 8)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 4, 4)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (4)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (6)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 = 24 \)

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].
