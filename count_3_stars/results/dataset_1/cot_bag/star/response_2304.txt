Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {1, 6}

Since node 3 and node 7 have less than 3 neighbors, they do not form any 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for the remaining nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars from each node: 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 10

So there are a total of 10 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 5)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
