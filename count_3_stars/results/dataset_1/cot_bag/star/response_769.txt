Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)
Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9)
Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 9)
Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 9)
Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 8)
Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9)
Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 10 = 56

So, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 9, 5)>
<2, (1, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
