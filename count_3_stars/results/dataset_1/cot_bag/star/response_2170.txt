Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 2, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 7, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors 3, 4, 5 (3 neighbors)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 20 + 4 = 28 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
