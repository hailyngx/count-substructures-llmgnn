Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list out the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, there are a total of 4 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, and <9, (1, 2, 6)>.
