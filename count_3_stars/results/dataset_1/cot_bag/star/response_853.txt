Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given in the provided list. Let's analyze the neighbors of each node to determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6}. Total 3-stars = 0
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 8}. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 8}. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6}. Total 3-stars = 0
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5}. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7}. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}. Total 3-stars = 1
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2}. Total 3-stars = 0
- Node 9: Neighbors {}. Total 3-stars = 0

Adding up the total 3-stars for each node gives a total of 5 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>.
