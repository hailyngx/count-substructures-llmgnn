Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3

Based on the given edges, we can construct the graph as described. 

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, 6, 7>
2. <2, 3, 9>
3. <5, 8, 7>
4. <6, 1, 7>
5. <7, 1, 8>
6. <8, 2, 5>
