Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 \).

Therefore, the answer is [18]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (3, 2, 9)>
