Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-star formations for each of these nodes.

For node 1: 
There are 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>

For node 3: 
There are 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
There are 4 neighbors (1, 2, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
There are 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9), so only 1 3-star can be formed.
<5, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 9:
There are 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5), so only 1 3-star can be formed.
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Taking into account all the 3-stars found, we get a total of [14].
