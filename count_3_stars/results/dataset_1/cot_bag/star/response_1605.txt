Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's start by determining the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 1)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (Nodes 0, 2, 6)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 8, 9)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (Node 6)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 9)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (Nodes 4, 7, 8)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 3)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (Nodes 2, 5, 7)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 4)

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula explained earlier:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \sum_{\text{n has at least 3 neighbors}} \binom{n}{3} \]

Calculating for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 16 3-stars from nodes with at least 3 neighbors.

So, the final number of 3-stars is 16, and the unique 3-stars are:
\[ \text{[16]} \]

Thank you for challenging me with this task.
