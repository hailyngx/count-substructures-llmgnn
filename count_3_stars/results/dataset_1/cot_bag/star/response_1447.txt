Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, and 9.

For node 0, we have edges (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5). So, we can form a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars using node 0. 

For node 4, we have edges (4, 0), (4, 8), (4, 9). So, we can form a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star using node 4.

For node 6, we have edges (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9). So, we can form a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star using node 6.

For node 9, we have edges (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7). So, we can form a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars using node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [ 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 ] = [10] \).

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (4, 6, 7)>.
