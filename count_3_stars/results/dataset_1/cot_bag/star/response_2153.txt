Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 52 possible 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

Some of the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
among others.
