Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 7
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 5, 1
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 9, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
For Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <3, (1, 5, 1)>.
