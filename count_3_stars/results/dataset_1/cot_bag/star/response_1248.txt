Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 0), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 8) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 9) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 7) - Does not form a 3-star
Node 3: (3, 8), (3, 9) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 5: (5, 0) - Does not form a 3-star
Node 6: (6, 8), (6, 9) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 4) - Does not form a 3-star
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9) - Forms 1 3-star
Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8) - Forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 8)>
<1, (4, 9)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (8, 9)>
