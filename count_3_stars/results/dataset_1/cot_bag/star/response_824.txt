Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 three-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 three-stars.
- Node 3 has 15 three-stars. 
- Node 4 has 3 three-stars. 
- Node 5 has 3 three-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 three-stars. 
- Node 8 has 3 three-stars. 
- Node 9 has 3 three-stars. 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 3 + 15 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 37.

Therefore, there are [37] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)> 
<0, (4, 7, 9)> 
<2, (4, 6, 9)> 
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)> 
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
