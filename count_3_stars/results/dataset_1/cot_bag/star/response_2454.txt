Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 2 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
