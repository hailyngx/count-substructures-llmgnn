Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- 0: 2, 5, 6, 9
- 1: 3, 6, 8
- 2: 0, 4, 5, 8
- 3: 1, 4, 5, 6
- 4: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- 5: 0, 2, 3, 7
- 6: 0, 1, 3, 7
- 7: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- 9: 0, 4, 7

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up, we get 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 46.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
