Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [2]
- Node 9: [1]

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <6, 4, 7>
