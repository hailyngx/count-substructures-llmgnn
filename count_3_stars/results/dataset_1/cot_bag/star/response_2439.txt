Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>.
