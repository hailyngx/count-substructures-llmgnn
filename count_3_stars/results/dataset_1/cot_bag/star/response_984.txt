Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
Node 3 forms 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
