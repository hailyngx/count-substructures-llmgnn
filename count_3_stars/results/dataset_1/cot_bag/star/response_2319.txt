Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we first need to determine how many neighbors each node has. 
Here is the list of nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 8: 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

Now we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 9, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 0)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 8)>

There are total [5] unique 3-stars in this graph.
