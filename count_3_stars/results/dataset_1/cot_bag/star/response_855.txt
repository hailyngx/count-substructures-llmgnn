Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 0:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
Number of 3-stars around node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 1:
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
Number of 3-stars around node 1: 1
<1, (0, 2, 9)>

For node 2:
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5
No 3-star is formed around node 2.

For node 6:
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8
Number of 3-stars around node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 9
Number of 3-stars around node 7: 1
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
Number of 3-stars around node 8: 1
<8, (3, 6, 7)>

For node 9:
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 7
Number of 3-stars around node 9: 1
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
