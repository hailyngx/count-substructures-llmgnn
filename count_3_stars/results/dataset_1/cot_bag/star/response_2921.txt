Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 5: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 10 = 62 \)

Thus, there are 62 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [62].
