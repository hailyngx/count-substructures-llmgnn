Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two nodes in this graph with three or more neighbors: node 1 and node 2. 

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>,
<2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>,
<2, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>,
<2, (1, 3, 4)>,
