Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 7)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying ${10 \choose 3} = 120$ to the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 4: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 6: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 7: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 8: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Adding these up, we have a total of $1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18$ 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
