Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form. We will exclude nodes with fewer than three neighbors since they cannot form 3-stars.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8. It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5. It can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9. It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7. It can form 1 3-star.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars formed, we get a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
