Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, namely nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 10 + 1 + 4] = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>
