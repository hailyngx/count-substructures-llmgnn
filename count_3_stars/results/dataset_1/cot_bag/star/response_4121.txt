Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges. 

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are as follows: 
- 0 is connected to 2, 6, 7, and 8
- 1 is connected to 5
- 2 is connected to 0, 3, 8, and 9
- 3 is connected to 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- 4 is connected to 8
- 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 8
- 6 is connected to 0
- 7 is connected to 0 and 3
- 8 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5
- 9 is connected to 2 and 3

Let's now find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars: <3, (2, 7, 8)> and <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Putting this all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
