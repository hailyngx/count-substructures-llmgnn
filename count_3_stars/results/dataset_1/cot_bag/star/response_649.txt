Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 1
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 0
- Node 9: Degree 6

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 4 unique 3-stars <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 9, 5)>
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 1 unique 3-star <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 4 unique 3-stars <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 9, 1)>
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 1 unique 3-star <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - 20 unique 3-stars <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 0)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 7, 5)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 6)>, <9, (4, 0, 5)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 2)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (6, 0, 1)>, <9, (6, 1, 5)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 3-stars in this graph.
Putting the final number inside brackets: [30]
