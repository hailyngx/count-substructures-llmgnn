Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 8

Based on the given connectivity, the 3-star configurations are as follows:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (2, 7, 8) and (5, 6, 7)
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with (0, 3, 6) and (2, 6, 7)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. These 3-stars are <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, and <4, (2, 6, 7)>.
