Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors.
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12. Hence, the final result is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
