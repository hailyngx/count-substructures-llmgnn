Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Edges: (2, 7), (2, 8), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 7), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 4: inom{1}{3} = 0
For node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 8: inom{1}{3} = 0
For node 9: inom{1}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 = 2

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
