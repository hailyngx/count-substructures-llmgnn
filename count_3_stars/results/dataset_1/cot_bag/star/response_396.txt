Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To start, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 24 3-stars. So, the final answer is [24].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
