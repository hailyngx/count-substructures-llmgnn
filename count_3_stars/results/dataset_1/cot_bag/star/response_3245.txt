Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [28] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (7, 8, 0)>
- <9, (7, 8, 1)>
- <9, (7, 8, 2)>
