Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 9)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 29 \]

Therefore, there are 29 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:
\[ <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)> \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [29].
