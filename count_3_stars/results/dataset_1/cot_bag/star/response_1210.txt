Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: 
Total neighboring nodes = 5
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>

For node 1: 
Total neighboring nodes = 3
Number of 3-stars = 1
<1, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 2: 
Total neighboring nodes = 3
Number of 3-stars = 1
<2, (0, 3, 6)>

For node 3: 
Total neighboring nodes = 3
Number of 3-stars = 1
<3, (0, 2, 9)>

For node 4: 
Total neighboring nodes = 2
Number of 3-stars = 0

For node 6: 
Total neighboring nodes = 6
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 9, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>

For node 9: 
Total neighboring nodes = 6
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 20 + 20] = 53. 

Therefore, the final answer is [53].
