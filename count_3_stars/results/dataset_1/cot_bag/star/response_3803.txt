Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8.

Now, for each of these nodes with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8. So, it cannot form any 3-star.
3. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7. So, it cannot form any 3-star.
4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7. So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
5. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars:

\[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 13 \]

So, there are 13 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
