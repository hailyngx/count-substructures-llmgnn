Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
0: {2, 5, 7, 9}
1: {4, 8, 9}
2: {0}
3: {6, 7}
4: {1}
5: {0}
6: {3}
7: {0, 3, 8}
8: {1, 7}
9: {0, 1}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1+1+1] = [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
So, putting the final count within brackets and listing the unique 3-stars:
[3]
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>
