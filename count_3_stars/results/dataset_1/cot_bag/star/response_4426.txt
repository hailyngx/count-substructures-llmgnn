Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7

Let's go through each node and calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars with its neighbors: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, and so on.
- Total number of 3-stars: 20

For Node 2:
- Node 2 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (0, 5, 6)>

For Node 5:
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with its neighbors: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 3)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>

For Node 6:
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with its neighbors: <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (3, 9, 7)>, and so on.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with its neighbors: <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

So, the final answer is [30]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (3, 9, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
