Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 0 + 0 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars formed are: 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>.

(Since there are no stars with nodes 1, 9, 3, or 2, they are not included in the list of unique 3-stars.)
