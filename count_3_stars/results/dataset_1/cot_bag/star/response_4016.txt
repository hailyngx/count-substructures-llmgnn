Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors for clarity:

Node 0: 4

Node 1: 2, 6, 8

Node 2: 1, 6

Node 3: 4, 6, 8, 9

Node 4: 0, 3, 7

Node 6: 1, 2, 3

Node 7: 4

Node 8: 1, 3, 9

Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For node 1, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

For node 2, we have inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.

For node 3, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, and <3, (6, 8, 9)>.

For node 8, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of [1 + 0 + 4 + 1] = 6 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: <<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>>.
