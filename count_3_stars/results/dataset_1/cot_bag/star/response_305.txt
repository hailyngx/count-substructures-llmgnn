Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 7
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 6
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4

We will calculate the number of 3-stars originating from these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, there are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. Putting this inside brackets, we have a total of [6].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>
