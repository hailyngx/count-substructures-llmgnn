Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us $10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 50$.

So, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>
