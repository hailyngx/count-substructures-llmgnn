Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given above. Let's first represent the graph visually by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1  
Node 1: 0, 2, 7  
Node 2: 1, 9  
Node 3: 6, 9  
Node 4: 9  
Node 5: 9  
Node 6: 3, 8, 9  
Node 7: 1, 8, 9  
Node 8: 6, 7  
Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 = 42\]

So, there are 42 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 2, 7)>  
<2, (1, 9, 0)>  
<3, (6, 9, 5)>  
<6, (3, 9, 8)>  
<7, (1, 8, 9)>  
<9, (2, 4, 5)>  
<9, (3, 4, 5)>  
<9, (6, 4, 5)>  
<9, (7, 4, 5)>  
<9, (3, 6, 8)>  
<9, (3, 6, 7)>  
<9, (3, 7, 8)>  
<9, (6, 7, 8)>  
<9, (1, 2, 0)>  
<9, (1, 4, 5)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are as listed above.
