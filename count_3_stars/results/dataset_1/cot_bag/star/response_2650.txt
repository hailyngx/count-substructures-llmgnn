Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Thus, we can construct 3-stars from nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9. Node 3 doesn't have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.

From node 0:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>

From node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = 1
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 7)>

From node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = 1
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 9)>

From node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = 1
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [13] \] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 13.
