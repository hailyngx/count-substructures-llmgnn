Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to 0 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 4, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to 1, 4, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1] = [14] \).

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- <6, (7, 8, 4)>
- <6, (7, 8, 5)>
- <6, (8, 4, 5)>
- <6, (8, 5, 7)>
- <6, (8, 7, 0)>
- <6, (8, 7, 4)>
- <6, (8, 7, 5)>
