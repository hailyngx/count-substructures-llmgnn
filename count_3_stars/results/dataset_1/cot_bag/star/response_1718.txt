Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Applying the method mentioned earlier, we find the following 3-stars:
\[ [14] \]
<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>
