Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will examine each node to see if it can be the center of a 3-star. 

1. Node 0 has 1 neighbor (node 7).
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors (nodes 5, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors (nodes 7, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>.
4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors (nodes 6, 8).
5. Node 5 has 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 7).
6. Node 6 has 1 neighbor (node 3).
7. Node 7 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 5, 8), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>.
8. Node 8 has 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 3, 7), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
9. Node 9 has 1 neighbor (node 2).

Summing up the total number of 3-stars which is 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 25. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 7)>.
