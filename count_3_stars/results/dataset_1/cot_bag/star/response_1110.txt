Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7}

Identifying the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, 5, and 7 have 4 or more neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 2, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 8, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>.
