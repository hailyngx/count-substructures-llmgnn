Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes that have three or more neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9). Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-stars]
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-stars]
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-stars]
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: [1 3-stars]
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: [4 3-stars]
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: [4 3-stars]
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 6, 8>
<2, 0, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<5, 4, 6>
<6, 0, 1>
<6, 1, 8>
<6, 5, 4>
<6, 8, 4>
<8, 6, 1>
<8, 6, 7>
