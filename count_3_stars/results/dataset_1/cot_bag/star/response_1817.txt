Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 8, 9), so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9), so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8), so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 8), so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6), so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 4), so it does not form any 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars formed: \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 41 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (4, 7, 8)>
