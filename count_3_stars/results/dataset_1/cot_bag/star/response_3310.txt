Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are two nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 0 and node 1. 
Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So the final count is [1 + 4] = 5 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
