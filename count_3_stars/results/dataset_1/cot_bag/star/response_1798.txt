Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first look at each node that has three or more neighbors. Nodes 0, 1, 8, and 6 satisfy this condition. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 5. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, and 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Hence, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, and <8, (0, 3, 7)>. Let me know if you need any more help!
