Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: 

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 27 \]

So, there are 27 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)> 

Thus, the final answer is [27].
