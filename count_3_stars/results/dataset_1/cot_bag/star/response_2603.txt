Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 8, 9
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 2
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8

We see that nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of them:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 2 forms 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
   <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 4, 9)>, <9, (8, 4, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 22
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 4, 9)>, <9, (8, 4, 9)>
