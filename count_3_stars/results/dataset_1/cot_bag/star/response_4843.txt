Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9.
Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors - 2, 4, 5 (3 neighbors)
Node 2: Neighbors - 0, 7 (2 neighbors)
Node 4: Neighbors - 0, 5, 7, 8 (4 neighbors)
Node 5: Neighbors - 0, 4, 6 (3 neighbors)
Node 7: Neighbors - 2, 4 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. 
Considering the unique 3-stars formed in the graph, we have:    
[6]   
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
