Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars.

Let's analyze the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9)
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 8)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (1, 3)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8)
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (3, 4)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 1)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>
