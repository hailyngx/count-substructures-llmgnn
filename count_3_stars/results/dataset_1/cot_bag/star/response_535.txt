Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will follow the steps as mentioned earlier.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors (2, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 2 has neighbors (0, 1)
- Node 3 has neighbors (1, 4, 7)
- Node 4 has neighbors (0, 3)
- Node 6 has neighbors (1, 7)
- Node 7 has neighbors (3, 6)
- Node 8 has neighbors (1)

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
   <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 has no 3-stars (as it has exactly 2 neighbors)
- Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
   <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 has no 3-stars (as it has exactly 2 neighbors)
- Node 6 has no 3-stars (as it has exactly 2 neighbors)
- Node 7 has no 3-stars (as it has exactly 2 neighbors)
- Node 8 has no 3-stars (as it has exactly 1 neighbor)

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( [4 + 1] = 5 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5. 
The unique 3-stars are listed inside brackets: <>, and each 3-star is represented only once. 

Thus, the final answer is: [5]
