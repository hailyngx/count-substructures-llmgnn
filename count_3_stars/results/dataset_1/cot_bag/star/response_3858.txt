Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges as described:

```
   0 ---- 6 ---- 3
   |      |  
   |      | 
   7      1 ---- 2 ---- 5
          |      |      |
          |      |      |
          8 ---- 4      9
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 8, 4)>, <1, (2, 8, 5)>, <1, (4, 8, 5)>
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 8, 4)>, <1, (2, 8, 5)>, <1, (4, 8, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 3)>.
