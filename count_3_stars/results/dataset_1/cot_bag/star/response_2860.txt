Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- 0: 1, 3, 7
- 1: 0
- 2: 3, 5, 6
- 3: 0, 2
- 4: 6, 8
- 5: 2, 6
- 6: 2, 4, 5, 9
- 7: 0
- 8: 4, 9
- 9: 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form C(3, 3) = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form C(3, 3) = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6) = 6. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
