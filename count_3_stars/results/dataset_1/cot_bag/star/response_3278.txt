Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to check each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's determine the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Number of 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 8, 9)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Unique 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 9)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Number of 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

There are 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
