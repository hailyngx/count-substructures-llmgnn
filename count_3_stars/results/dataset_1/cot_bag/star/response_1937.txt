Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph with nodes and edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: 
  - (0, 4), (0, 6)
  - (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7)
  - (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9)
  - (3, 2)
  - (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9)
  - (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 8)
  - (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8)
  - (7, 1)
  - (8, 5), (8, 6)
  - (9, 2), (9, 4)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [10 + 10 + 10] = [30]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30.
