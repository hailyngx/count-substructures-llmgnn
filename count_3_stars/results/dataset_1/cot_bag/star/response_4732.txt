Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 2 and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors of node 2: 0, 6, 7, and 9.
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 9:
There are 5 neighbors of node 9: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 = 14.

Therefore, there are 14 3-stars in this graph.
These 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
