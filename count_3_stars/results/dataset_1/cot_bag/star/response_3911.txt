Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9. We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 37 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [37].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
