Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
