Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (4, 8), so it does not form any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Has 1 neighbor (7), so it does not form any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7), forming 1 3-star.
4. Node 3: Has 1 neighbor (2), so it does not form any 3-star.
5. Node 4: Has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 8), forming 4 3-stars.
6. Node 5: Has 1 neighbor (8), so it does not form any 3-star.
7. Node 6: Has 4 neighbors (4, 8, 9), forming 4 3-stars.
8. Node 7: Has 2 neighbors (1, 2), so it does not form any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 9), forming 10 3-stars.
10. Node 9: Has 2 neighbors (6, 8), so it does not form any 3-star.

In total, there are 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, and <8, (0, 5, 9)>.
