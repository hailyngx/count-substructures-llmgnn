Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 and their connections are given. Let's draw the graph:

         (5)---(9)---(1)---(4)
           |     |     |     |
           |     |     |     |
          (6)---(3)---(0)---(7)---(8)
                   
Next, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 7), so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7: It has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 9), so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 9: It has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 25.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>
