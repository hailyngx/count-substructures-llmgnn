Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>

2. Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
   <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, 
   <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>,
   <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (4, 6, 8)>,
   <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 4, 8)>,
   <4, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (4, 8, 9)>

3. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

4. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (7, 5, 4)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9: 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
