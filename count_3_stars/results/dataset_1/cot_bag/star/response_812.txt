Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {6}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 

Node 0 forms 1 3-star: 1
Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: 1
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: 1
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: 1
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: 1

Summing these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 3-stars. 

Thus, the final answer is [9].
