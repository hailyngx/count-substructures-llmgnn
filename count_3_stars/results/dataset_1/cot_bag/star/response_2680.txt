Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, let's first list the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 7
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 2

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars centered at nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

There are a total of 16 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 0)>
<5, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 0, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 8)>
