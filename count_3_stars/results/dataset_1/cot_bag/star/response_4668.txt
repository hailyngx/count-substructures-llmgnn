Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each such node.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: It has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
