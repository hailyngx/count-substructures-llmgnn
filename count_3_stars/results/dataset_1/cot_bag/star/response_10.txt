Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. We will then count the number of 3-stars associated with each such node.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
  - Total 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star for node 0: <0, (1, 4, 9)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7
  - Total 3-stars for node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars for node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
  - Total 3-stars for node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars for node 3: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9
  - Total 3-stars for node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars for node 8: <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 19.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>
