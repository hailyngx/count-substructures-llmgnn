Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look at nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's identify these nodes:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 17 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [17].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph as requested:

<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 3, 6)>
