Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Analyzing the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 6
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2

Node 6 is the only node with 6 neighbors and will contribute to the formation of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars involving node 6:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20\]
So, there are 20 3-stars involving node 6. 

Putting this information together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20.
Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 1)>
<6, (8, 1, 2)>
<6, (8, 4, 1)>
<6, (8, 1, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 1)>
<6, (9, 3, 1)>
