Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can represent the graph as follows:

```
    1 -- 3
   /      \
  0        7 -- 9
   \      /|\
    4 -- 2 5 8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 8 neighbors (which is more than 3), so it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 56 (from node 7) = 58.

So, the final answer is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 7>
- <7, 0, 8>
- <7, 0, 9>
- <7, 1, 3>
- <7, 2, 4>
- <7, 2, 9>
- <7, 3, 1>
- <7, 3, 5>
- <7, 4, 0>
- <7, 4, 2>
- <7, 4, 5>
- <7, 5, 7>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <7, 8, 0>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <7, 9, 0>
- <7, 9, 2>
- <7, 9, 5>
