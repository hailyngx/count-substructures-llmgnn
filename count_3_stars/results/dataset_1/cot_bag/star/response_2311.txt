Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding these up gives us a total of 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [18].

The 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
