Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {5}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 7, 8}. <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 9, 0}. <3, (4, 9, 0)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 3, 5}. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 7, 6}. <5, (4, 7, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 9, 5}. <7, (1, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
