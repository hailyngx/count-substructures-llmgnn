Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: Nodes 6, 7, 8. This forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: Nodes 3, 6, 7, 8. This forms 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: Nodes 3, 8. It cannot form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: Nodes 1, 2, 6, 1. This forms 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor: Node 7. It cannot form any 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 3. This forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 4. This forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 2. This forms 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
