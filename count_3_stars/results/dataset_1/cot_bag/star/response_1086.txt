Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph based on the given information:
```
   0 --- 2 --- 1
   |  \  |  /  |
   |   \ | /   |
   6 --- 3 --- 7
        /|\
       8 | 9
        \|/
        4-5
```

Looking at the graph, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, meaning they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate how many 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <2, 3, 6>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 6, 0>
- <2, 6, 3>
- <2, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 0>

- <6, 0, 2>
- <6, 0, 3>
- <7, 3, 6>
- <7, 3, 4>

- <7, 4, 8>
