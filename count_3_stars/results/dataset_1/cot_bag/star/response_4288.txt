Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Let's now identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes: 1, 3, 6. (3 stars)
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes: 0, 5, 6. (3 stars)
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes: 4, 5, 6 and 2, 8, 9. (2 stars)
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes: 0, 5, 8 and 2, 9, 4. (2 stars)
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes: 1, 2, 4 and 3, 4, 8. (2 stars)
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes: 0, 1, 2. (1 star)
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1] = 13. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 9, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
