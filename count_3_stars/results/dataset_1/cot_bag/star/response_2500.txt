Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

      1 -- 5 -- 6 -- 8
     /      /
    0 -- 2 -- 4 -- 7
           \     /
            9

From the graph, we see that nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 0:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 0.

For node 4:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star around node 4.

For node 7:
There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star around node 7.

For node 9:
There are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars around node 9 since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Adding up the 3-stars from all qualifying nodes, we get a total of 10 + 1 + 1 = 12 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 4)>, <0, (4, 2, 7)>, <0, (7, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
