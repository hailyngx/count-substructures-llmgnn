Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 8 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For Node 1 and Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
For Node 8 and Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28 \), which should be placed inside brackets: [])

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 8)>, <1, (8, 4, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 7)>, <1, (9, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (9, 7, 8)>, <1, (9, 8, 7)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 8)>, <7, (8, 1, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (9, 1, 8)>, <7, (9, 8, 1)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 4)>, <8, (4, 1, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>, <8, (7, 1, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 1)>, <8, (9, 1, 4)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 3)>, <9, (3, 1, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 1)>, <9, (7, 1, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 1)>, <9, (8, 1, 4)>, <9, (8, 7, 1)>.
