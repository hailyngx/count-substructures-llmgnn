Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8   
1: 0, 3, 6, 9    
2: 0, 5, 6, 7   
3: 1, 6   
4: 0, 9  
5: 0, 2, 6, 9  
6: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8  
7: 0, 2, 6  
8: 0, 6  
9: 1, 4, 5  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 49  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].
