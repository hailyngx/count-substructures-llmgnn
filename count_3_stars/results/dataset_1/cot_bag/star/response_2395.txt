Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we draw the graph based on the given information:
```
    0 -- 1 -- 7 -- 9
    |         |    
    2 -- 3    6
         |
         4 -- 5
```

Now, we look at each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0: (0, 1, 2) - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
Node 1: (1, 0, 7) - <1, (0, 7, 8)>
Node 2: (2, 0, 3) - <2, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 3: (3, 2, -)
Node 4: (4, 5, -)
Node 5: (5, 4, -)
Node 6: (6, 7, -)
Node 7: (7, 1, 9) - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
Node 8: (8, 1, -)
Node 9: (9, 7, -)

Count of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>
