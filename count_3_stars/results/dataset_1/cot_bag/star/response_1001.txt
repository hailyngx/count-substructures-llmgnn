Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 contributes C(6,3) = 20 3-stars
Node 2 contributes C(4,3) = 4 3-stars
Node 3 contributes C(3,3) = 1 3-star
Node 4 contributes C(3,3) = 1 3-star
Node 5 contributes C(3,3) = 1 3-star
Node 7 contributes C(3,3) = 1 3-star
Node 8 contributes C(3,3) = 1 3-star
Node 9 contributes C(3,3) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are [30] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (6, 7, 2)>
