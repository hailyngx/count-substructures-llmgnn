Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0: {4, 6}
- 1: {6}
- 2: {3, 8}
- 3: {2, 5, 7}
- 4: {0, 5}
- 5: {3, 4}
- 6: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- 7: {3}
- 8: {2, 6}
- 9: {6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0: [1] = [1]
For node 1: [1] = [1]
For node 2: [1] = [1]
For node 3: [1] = [1]
For node 4: [1] = [1]
For node 5: [1] = [1]
For node 6: [1] = [1]
For node 7: [0] = [0]
For node 8: [1] = [1]
For node 9: [1] = [1]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = [8]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 0, 8)>
<2, (8, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<5, (4, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 3)>
