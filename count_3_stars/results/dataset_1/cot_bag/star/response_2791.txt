Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 6}
- Node 3: {8}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {1, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {3, 4}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 2, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Therefore, putting the final number inside brackets []: 
\[ [4] \]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 2, 6, 7>
- <2, 0, 6, 5>
- <6, 2, 0, 5>
- <8, 3, 4, 8>
