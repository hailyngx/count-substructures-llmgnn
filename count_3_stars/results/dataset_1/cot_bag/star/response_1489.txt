Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can construct the following representation:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the given graph:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star (<1, (5, 6, 9)>)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (<4, (0, 6, 9)>)
- Node 5: 1 3-star (<5, (0, 6, 9)>)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (<6, (0, 1, 9)>)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (<9, (1, 4, 5)>)

Summing up the total, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
