Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be described as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 7.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 6 and 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars and calculate their total number.

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <1, 5, 6, 7>
- Node 1 also forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <1, 6, 7, 9>

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in this graph.
