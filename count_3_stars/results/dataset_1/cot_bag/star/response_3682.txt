Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars involving node 0 are: 
  <0, (1, 4, 5)>, 
  <0, (1, 3, 4)>, 
  <0, (3, 4, 5)>, 
  <0, (4, 5, 7)>.

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  The 3-star involving node 1 is: <1, (0, 2, 9)>.

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars involving node 3 are:
  <3, (0, 4, 9)>,
  <3, (0, 4, 7)>,
  <3, (0, 7, 8)>,
  <3, (0, 7, 9)>,
  <3, (4, 7, 9)>,
  <3, (4, 7, 8)>,
  <3, (7, 8, 9)>,
  <3, (4, 8, 9)>,
  <3, (4, 5, 7)>,
  <3, (4, 5, 9)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars involving node 4 are:
  <4, (0, 3, 9)>,
  <4, (0, 3, 7)>,
  <4, (3, 7, 9)>,
  <4, (3, 5, 9)>.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars involving node 5 are:
  <5, (0, 2, 7)>,
  <5, (2, 6, 7)>,
  <5, (0, 4, 7)>,
  <5, (3, 4, 7)>.

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  The 3-star involving node 9 is: <9, (1, 3, 4)>.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [24].
