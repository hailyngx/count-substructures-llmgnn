Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1: 4, 7, 8, 9
2: 0, 7
3: 0, 5, 6, 8
4: 0, 1, 5, 8
5: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
6: 0, 3, 8
7: 1, 2, 5
8: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
9: 1

We see that only nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5 have 3 or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars from these nodes:

From node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
From node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
From node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
From node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28, which we write as [28].

Unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
