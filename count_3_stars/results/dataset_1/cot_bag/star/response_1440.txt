Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 8
- 1 is connected to 3, 5, 6
- 2 is connected to 4, 8
- 3 is connected to 1, 4
- 4 is connected to 2, 3, 5, 9
- 5 is connected to 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- 6 is connected to 1, 5, 7, 9
- 7 is connected to 6, 8
- 8 is connected to 0, 2, 5, 7
- 9 is connected to 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star and count the total number of 3-stars:  

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the contributions: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 7)>.
