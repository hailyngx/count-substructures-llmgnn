Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 4] = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>,
<7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>,
<8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>.
