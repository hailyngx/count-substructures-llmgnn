Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 20 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, and <9, (2, 5, 8)>.
