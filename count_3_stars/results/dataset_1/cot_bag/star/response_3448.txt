Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 3, 5, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 2: neighbors 1, 5, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 5: neighbors 1, 2, 4, 7, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 7: neighbors 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 (degree 5)
- Node 8: neighbors 0, 1, 7, 9 (degree 4)
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 2, 4, 5, 8 (degree 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

Unique 3-stars:
