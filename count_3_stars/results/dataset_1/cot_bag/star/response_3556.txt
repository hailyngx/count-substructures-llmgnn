Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
     0 -- 2 -- 7 -- 6
     |         |    |
     1         3 -- 9
                 |
                 8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors

For node 2, there is 1 3-star formed. For node 3, there are no 3-stars formed.
So, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found in this graph is <2, (0, 7, 6)>.
