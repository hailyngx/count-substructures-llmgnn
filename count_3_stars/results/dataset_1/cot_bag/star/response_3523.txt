Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 48

Thus, there are 48 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<5, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>
