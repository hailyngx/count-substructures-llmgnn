Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

By calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes 0, 2, and 3 (as they have at least 3 neighbors each), we find:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 4 = 9.

Thus, the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>.
