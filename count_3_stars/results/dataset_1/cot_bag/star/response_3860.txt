Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, for the nodes with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4] = 14 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 0, 7)>
<3, (4, 1, 7)>
<3, (4, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 1)>
<7, (2, 4, 1)>
<7, (2, 6, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 1)>
<7, (4, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 0)>
