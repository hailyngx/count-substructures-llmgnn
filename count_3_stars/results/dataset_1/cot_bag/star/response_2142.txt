Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 6

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula mentioned earlier.
For nodes with degree 3 or more, we have:
- Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 1: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 4: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 9: C(6, 3) = 20

Summing up these values gives a total of 54 3-stars.
So, the total number of 3-stars = [54].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
