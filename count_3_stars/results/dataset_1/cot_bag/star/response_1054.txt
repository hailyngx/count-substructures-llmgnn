Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)> and <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 1 has 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 has 1 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 has 2 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 7)> and <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 has 1 3-star: <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 has 1 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 9 has 1 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9].
