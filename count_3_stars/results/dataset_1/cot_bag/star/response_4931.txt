Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {4}
- Node 1: neighbors {5}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {5}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node starting from node 0:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The 3-star configurations are: <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 4)>
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7] \). 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
