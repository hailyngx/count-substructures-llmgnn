Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes have the potential to form 3-stars.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 6
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 9
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 3, 9
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 3, 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 25 \).

Thus, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
