Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the formula mentioned earlier:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 2, 5)>
- <0, (4, 2, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 0, 5)>
- <2, (4, 0, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 0, 7)>
