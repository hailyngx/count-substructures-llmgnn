Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star 
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
