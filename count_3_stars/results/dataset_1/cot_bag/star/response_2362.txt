Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 3 and node 5.
Let's find the 3-stars centered at node 3:
\[
\binom{4}{3} = 4
\]
So, we have 4 3-stars centered at node 3. The unique 3-stars are <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, and <3, (2, 5, 6)>.

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at node 5:
\[
\binom{6}{3} = 20
\]
So, we have 20 3-stars centered at node 5. The unique 3-stars are <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, and <5, (6, 7, 9)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 (centered at node 3) + 20 (centered at node 5) = 24.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].
