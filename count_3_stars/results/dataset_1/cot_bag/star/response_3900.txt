Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 7, 9
Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 4, 7
Node 4: 2, 3, 8
Node 5: 0, 2, 6
Node 6: 0, 5, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3
Node 8: 4, 6
Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1+ 4 + 0 + 1] = [16] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 8)>
<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 0, 6)>
<2, (7, 0, 9)>
<2, (9, 0, 1)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
