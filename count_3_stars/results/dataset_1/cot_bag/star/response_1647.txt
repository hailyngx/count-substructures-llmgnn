Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars each can form.

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
  <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (8, 9, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (9, 7, 8)>, <0, (0, 2, 3)>, <0, (0, 2, 9)>, <0, (0, 6, 8)>, <0, (0, 7, 9)>, <0, (0, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 9)>, <0, (0, 1, 2)>, <0, (0, 1, 6)>, <0, (0, 1, 7)>, <0, (0, 1, 9)>, <0, (0, 6, 9)>, <0, (0, 7, 8)>.

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>.

- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
  <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>      

- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>.

- Node 9 has 8 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.
  <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 9, 9)>,
  <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>. 

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, we have 35 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 56 = 145 3-stars.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [145].
