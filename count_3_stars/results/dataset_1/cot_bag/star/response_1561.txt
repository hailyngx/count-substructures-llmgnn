Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Let's analyze each node to see if it can form a 3-star.

Node 0: Only 1 edge connected to node 7, not enough neighbors.
Node 1: 3 edges connected to nodes 7, 9; can form 1 3-star.
Node 2: 6 edges connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8; can form 10 3-stars.
Node 3: 4 edges connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8; can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4: 3 edges connected to nodes 2, 5, 6; can form 1 3-star.
Node 5: 4 edges connected to nodes 2, 3, 4; can form 4 3-stars.
Node 6: 5 edges connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8; can form 6 3-stars.
Node 7: 2 edges connected to nodes 0, 1, not enough neighbors.
Node 8: 3 edges connected to nodes 2, 3, 6; can form 1 3-star.
Node 9: 1 edge connected to node 1, not enough neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 10 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 4 3-stars.
Node 6 forms 6 3-stars.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<2, (3, 4, 5)>
