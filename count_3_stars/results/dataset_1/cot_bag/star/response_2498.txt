Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each node with three or more neighbors.

1. Node 0: It has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
   <0, (1, 2, 7)>

2. Node 1: It has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

3. Node 2: It has 6 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars. 
   <2, (0, 1, 7)>
   <2, (1, 0, 7)>
   <2, (3, 6, 7)>
   <2, (6, 3, 7)>

4. Node 3: It has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

5. Node 4: It has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

6. Node 5: It has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

7. Node 6: It has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
   <6, (2, 8, 7)>

8. Node 7: It has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
   <7, (0, 2, 6)>

9. Node 8: It has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
   <8, (2, 4, 6)>

10. Node 9: It has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star. 
    <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 8.
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 8, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<8, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 5)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
