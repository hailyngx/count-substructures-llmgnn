Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the edge list provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 4, 5)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 9)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 4, 7, 8)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
  - <0, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (1, 3, 8)>

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <1, (0, 4, 5)>

- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <4, (0, 1, 9)>

- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 2, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 6, 2)>

- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 11 in total. Therefore, the answer is [11].
