Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 3, 5, and 6.

For node 2: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 2: 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 3: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 3:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>

For node 5: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 5: 
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>

For node 6: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Unique 3-stars for node 6:
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
