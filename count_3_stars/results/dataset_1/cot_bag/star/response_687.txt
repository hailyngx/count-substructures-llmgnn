Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
For this graph, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, and we can form 1 3-star. Thus, there is <0, (5, 6, 8)>.

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, and we can form 1 3-star. Thus, there is <4, (1, 2, 5)>.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 6 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, and we can form 1 3-star. Thus, there is <8, (0, 2, 3)>.

Node 9 has 3 neighbors, and we can form 1 3-star. Thus, there is <9, (0, 4, 8)>.

Putting all the 3-stars together, we have a total of [3] unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, and <9, (0, 4, 8)>.
