Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 2 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 3 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 3 neighbors
Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 2)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
