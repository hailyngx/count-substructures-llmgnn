Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 7 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 1 neighbor
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 1 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars inside brackets is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
