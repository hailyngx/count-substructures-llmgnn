Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

We see that only nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, therefore potentially forming 3-stars. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
For node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
For node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 29

Therefore, there are 29 3-stars in this graph.
Inside brackets: [29]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
