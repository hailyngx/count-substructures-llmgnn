Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: 2, 3
Node 1: 2, 4, 8
Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 9
Node 4: 1, 2, 6
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 1, 9
Node 9: 2, 3, 8

To calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 35 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 37

Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>
