Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with 10 nodes and the specified edges:

```
         1 ---- 0 ---- 4
        /|      |       |
       / |      |       |
      9  2     8        |
       \ |      |       |
        \|      |       |
          3 ---- 5 ---- 6
               /|     |
              / |     |
             9  8     7
              \ |    /
               \|   /
                 4
```

Now we can determine the 3-stars in this graph by examining each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
Node 5: <5, (3, 6, 9)>
Node 8: <8, (0, 5, 7)>
Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
