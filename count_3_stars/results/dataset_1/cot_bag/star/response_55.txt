Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's now identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 9}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
   <5, (0, 2, 6)>
   <5, (0, 2, 7)>
   <5, (0, 2, 8)>
   <5, (0, 6, 7)>
   <5, (0, 6, 8)>
   <5, (0, 7, 8)>
   <5, (2, 6, 7)>
   <5, (2, 6, 8)>
   <5, (2, 7, 8)>
   <5, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <3, (0, 7, 9)>
   <3, (5, 7, 9)>
   <3, (6, 7, 9)>
   <3, (9, 5, 7)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   <7, (3, 5, 9)>
   <7, (3, 6, 9)>
   <7, (5, 6, 9)>
   <7, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 4 + 4] = [18].
