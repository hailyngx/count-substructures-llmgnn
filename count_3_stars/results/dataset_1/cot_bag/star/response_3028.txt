Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 1: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 5: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 6: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Node 9: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$

Adding these up gives a total of 13 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [13].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
