Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>
