Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are four nodes (0, 1, 2, 6) with three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: There are 5 other nodes connected to node 0. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 1: There are 4 other nodes connected to node 1. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 2: There are 2 other nodes connected to node 2. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) as there are not enough neighbors.

For node 6: There are 4 other nodes connected to node 6. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up the 3-stars from all nodes that have three or more neighbors, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 1, 7)>, <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 0)>, <1, (7, 4, 0)>.
