Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Nodes 3 and 4 are the only nodes that have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 4:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
