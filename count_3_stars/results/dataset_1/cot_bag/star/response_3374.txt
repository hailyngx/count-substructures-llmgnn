Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- For Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, there are 6 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[0, 2, 9], [0, 4, 9], [0, 6, 5], [0, 6, 9], [4, 8, 9], [9, 3, 5]> 

So, the final count of 3-stars is [6].
