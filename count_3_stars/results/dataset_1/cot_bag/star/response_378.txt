Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the graph in an adjacency list format for better visualization:

Node 0: 1, 6, 9  
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8  
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8  
Node 3: 1, 2  
Node 4: 8, 9  
Node 5: 2  
Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9  
Node 7: 6, 8  
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7  
Node 9: 0, 4, 6  

Now, let's analyze the number of 3-stars in this graph according to the previously mentioned method.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there will be \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.  
<0, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there will be \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 4)>, <1, (2, 8, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 7)>

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with this node.
Node 5 has only 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with this node.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>

Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there will be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>

Adding them all up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
