Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node having three or more neighbors: 
- Node 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 each contribute \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 0 and 3 each contribute \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors).
- Node 2 and 9 do not contribute to any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [6 \times 1] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 4, 6)>

So, the final answer is: \[ 6 \text{ 3-stars} \]
