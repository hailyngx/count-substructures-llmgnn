Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 6 and 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Adding these up gives us a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>.
