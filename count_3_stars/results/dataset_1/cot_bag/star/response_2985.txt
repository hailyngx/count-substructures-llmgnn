Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({}^4C_3 = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \({}^4C_3 = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({}^5C_3 = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({}^5C_3 = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({}^2C_3 = 0\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [28], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 1, 7)>
<0, (7, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 0, 7)>
<1, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
