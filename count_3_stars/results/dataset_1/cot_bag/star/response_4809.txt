Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from \(0\) to \(9\) and the edges are given as follows:

\( \{(0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 2), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)\}\)

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node \(0\) has neighbors \(3\), \(6\), \(7\).
- Node \(2\) has neighbors \(5\), \(6\), \(7\), \(9\).
- Node \(3\) has neighbors \(0\), \(9\).
- Node \(4\) has neighbors \(1\), \(7\).
- Node \(7\) has neighbors \(0\), \(2\), \(4\).
- Node \(9\) has neighbors \(1\), \(2\), \(3\).

So, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes above and sum them up. 

For node \(0\): 
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

For node \(2\):
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node \(3\):
\( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For node \(4\): 
\( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For node \(7\): 
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

For node \(9\): 
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Sum: \(1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 7\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \([7]\).

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- \(<0, (3, 6, 7)>\)
- \(<2, (5, 6, 7)>\)
