Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has nodes {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and edges {(0, 7), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8)}. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 6.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 9, 2.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 8, 1.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 9 contributes 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 18 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (6, 7, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 2, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 2)>
<3, (9, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 3)>
<6, (3, 1, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<6, (5, 3, 1)>
