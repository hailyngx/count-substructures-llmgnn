Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's list them first along with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5, there are no 3-stars (it only has 3 neighbors)
- For node 6, there are no 3-stars (it only has 3 neighbors)
- For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
