Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 57

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [57].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
