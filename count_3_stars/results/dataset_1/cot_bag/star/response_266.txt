Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 24 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
