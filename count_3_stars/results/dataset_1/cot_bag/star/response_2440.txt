Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6, 6)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (node 6)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 7, 9, 1)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (node 1)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, 1)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (node 4)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 3)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (node 4)

We observe that nodes 1 and 4 have more than 3 neighbors, and thus have the potential to form 3-stars. 

For node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 6, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 6)>

For node 4, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars:
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is \( 4 + 10 = 14 \).

Thus, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [14]. 
The unique 3-stars observed are <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
