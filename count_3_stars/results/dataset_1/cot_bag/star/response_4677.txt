Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9, 5, 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>
