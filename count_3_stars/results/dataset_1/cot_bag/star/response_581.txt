Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of unique 3-stars formed by these nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8) \(\Rightarrow C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 7) \(\Rightarrow C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9) \(\Rightarrow C(6, 3) = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7) \(\Rightarrow C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars

Adding these together, we get a total of \([1 + 4 + 20 + 4] = 29\) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
