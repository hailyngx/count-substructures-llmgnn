Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For nodes 5 and 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars []. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (3, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 1, 5)>
- <6, (5, 1, 4)>
- <6, (5, 1, 9)>
- <6, (5, 9, 1)>
- <9, (5, 1, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 1)>
- <9, (6, 1, 5)>
- <9, (6, 5, 1)>
