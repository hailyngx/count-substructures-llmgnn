Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0:  Neighbors (1, 5, 8)
Node 2:  Neighbors (4, 7)
Node 7:  Neighbors (2, 8)

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0:  $ \binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
For Node 2:  $ \binom{2}{3} = 0$ 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
For Node 7:  $ \binom{2}{3} = 0$ 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <0, (1, 5, 8)>.
