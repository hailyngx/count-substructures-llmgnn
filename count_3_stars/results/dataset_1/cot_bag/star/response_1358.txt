Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9.
Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [38] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (7, 2, 3)>
