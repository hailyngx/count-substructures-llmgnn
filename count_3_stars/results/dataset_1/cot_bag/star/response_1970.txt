Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
