Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

The 10 nodes are: 
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges are:
(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), 
(2, 0), (2, 9), 
(3, 0), 
(4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 9), 
(5, 0), (5, 4), 
(7, 9), 
(8, 0),
(9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Let's identify nodes that can form 3-star graphs:
1. Node 0: It has 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8).
2. Node 2: It has 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 9).
3. Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 9).
4. Node 5: It has 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 4).
5. Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 7).

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 2: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
3. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 5: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
5. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 1 = 12, so the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (0, 2, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (0, 4, 8)>
<0, (0, 3, 8)>
<(2, 0, 8), 9>
<(2, 9, 4), 7>
