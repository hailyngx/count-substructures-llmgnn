Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
1. Node 0: Total 3-stars = 1
2. Node 1: Total 3-stars = 1
3. Node 2: Total 3-stars = 1
4. Node 5: Total 3-stars = 1
5. Node 7: Total 3-stars = 1
6. Node 8: Total 3-stars = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (3, 6, 9)>
