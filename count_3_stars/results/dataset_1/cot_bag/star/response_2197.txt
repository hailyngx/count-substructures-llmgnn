Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the only nodes that can form a 3-star. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 have at least three neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 37

So, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<8, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 8)>.
