Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:

- Nodes 1, 8, and 9: <1, (8, 9)>
- Nodes 3, 8, and 5: <3, (8, 5)>
- Nodes 7, 8, and 9: <7, (8, 9)>

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
