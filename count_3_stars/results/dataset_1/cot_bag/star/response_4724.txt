Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 9
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 

The total number of 3-stars is 1, and the unique 3-star is: 
[<9, (2, 3, 6)>]
