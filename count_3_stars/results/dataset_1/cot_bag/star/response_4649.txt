Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 8 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 6 neighbors
Node 6: 2 neighbors
Node 7: 2 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 56 + 20 + 4 = 85
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 1)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 1)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 6)>
<3, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 1)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 1)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
