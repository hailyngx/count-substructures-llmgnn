Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7)}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3 has neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 7 has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9 has neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 9)>
3. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
4. <1, (4, 5, 9)>
5. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
6. <2, (0, 7, 9)>
7. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
8. <2, (7, 8, 9)>
9. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
10. <5, (1, 3, 6)>
11. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
12. <5, (4, 6, 7)>
13. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
14. <7, (0, 4, 5)>
15. <7, (0, 4, 9)>
16. <7, (2, 4, 5)>
17. <7, (2, 5, 9)>
18. <7, (4, 5, 9)>
19. <9, (1, 4, 7)>
20. <9, (2, 4, 7)>
21. <9, (2, 7, 9)>
