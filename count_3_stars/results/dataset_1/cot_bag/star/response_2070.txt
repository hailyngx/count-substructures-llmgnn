Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 3 -- 2
    |         | 
    6         5

    9 -- 4 -- 7 -- 8
```

Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 1
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 5
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 2
- Node 9: degree = 5

Now, we will find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <3, 2, 5>
- <3, 5, 4>
- <3, 6, 1>
- <3, 6, 4>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 9, 7>
- <6, 1, 0>
- <6, 4, 5>
- <6, 4, 7>
- <6, 7, 4>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <7, 4, 5>
- <7, 6, 9>
- <7, 9, 6>
- <9, 0, 4>
- <9, 4, 6>
- <9, 4, 7>
- <9, 6, 4>
- <9, 6, 7>
- <9, 7, 4>
