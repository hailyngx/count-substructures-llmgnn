Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 5
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \({{n}\choose{3}}\):

- Node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\). So, <0, (2, 4, 5)> forms one 3-star.
- Node 1: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\). So, <1, (4, 5, 7)> forms one 3-star.
- Node 2: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\). So, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)> forms four 3-stars.
- Node 3: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\). So, <3, (2, 7, 9)> forms one 3-star.
- Node 5: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\). So, <5, (0, 1, 8)> forms one 3-star.
- Node 9: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\). So, <9, (2, 3, 9)> forms one 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>.
