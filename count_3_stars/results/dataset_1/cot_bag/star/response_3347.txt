Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, only nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7 have three or more neighbors, which means we will check for 3-stars around these nodes. 

For node 1:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 forms $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.

For node 3:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 forms $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is $1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10$, so the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
