Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's list the nodes with the number of their neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 4, 8)>
<3, (8, 6, 7)>
<3, (8, 9, 5)>
<4, (6, 8, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
