Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Thus, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (8, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 5)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<7, (6, 0, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 5)>
