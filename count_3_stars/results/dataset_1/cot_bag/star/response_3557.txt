Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 2: {5}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {7, 8}

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
