Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors (node 3 and node 8).
Node 1 has 2 neighbors (node 5 and node 9).
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, and 6).
Node 3 has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9).
Node 4 has 1 neighbor (node 3).
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7).
Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 8, and 9).
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 5, and 9).
Node 8 has 2 neighbors (node 0 and node 6).
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, and 7).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
