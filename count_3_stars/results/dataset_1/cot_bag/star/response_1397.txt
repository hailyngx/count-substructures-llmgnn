Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
0 -- 7       2 -- 8
|              |
7 -- 1 -- 3    8
|       |
8 -- 2
```

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can potentially form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can potentially form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, we have [6] 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (7, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 7, 1)>, <7, (1, 3, 2)>, <7, (1, 3, 2)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 8, 7)>.
