Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 0, 4>
<4, 0, 1>
<0, 4, 9>
<4, 0, 9>
<0, 1, 5>
<1, 0, 5>
<4, 1, 2>
<1, 4, 2>
<4, 1, 7>
<1, 4, 7>
<9, 0, 4>
<4, 9, 0>
<4, 9, 8>
<9, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 6>
<1, 0, 6>
<0, 5, 1>
<5, 0, 1>
<1, 6, 2>
<6, 1, 2>
<1, 7, 4>
<7, 1, 4> 

Putting this final number inside brackets: [19].
