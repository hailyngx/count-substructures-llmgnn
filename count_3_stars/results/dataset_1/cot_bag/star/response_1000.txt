Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph and then find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to node 6
- Node 5 is connected to node 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 42 3-stars in the graph.
Thus, the final result is [42].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

<8, (2, 7, 9)>
