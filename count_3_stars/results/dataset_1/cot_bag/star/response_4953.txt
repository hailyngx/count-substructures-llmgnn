Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (7, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
