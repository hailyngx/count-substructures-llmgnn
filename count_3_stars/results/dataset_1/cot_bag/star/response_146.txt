Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

From the list of edges provided:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Nodes 2, 4, 6 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors, and they can potentially form 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [ 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 ].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
