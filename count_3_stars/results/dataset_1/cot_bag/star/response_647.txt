Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The edges are quite interconnected, so let's construct the graph by listing the nodes each node is connected to:

Node 0: 1, 7
Node 1: 0, 6, 8
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: 4, 7
Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 9
Node 9: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [0] - no 3-stars
Node 1: [1] - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
Node 3: [0] - no 3-stars
Node 4: [1] - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
Node 5: [0] - no 3-stars
Node 6: [1] - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 7: [1] - <7, (0, 4, 6)>
Node 8: [0] - no 3-stars
Node 9: [3] - <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 3] = 6. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.
