Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 7
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of [11] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3,  6,  9)>
<3, (2,  6,  7)>
<4, (1,  5,  7)>
<5, (0,  4,  7)>
<9, (2,  4,  8)>
