Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, and 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 0 as the central node.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed with node 4 as the central node.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed with node 8 as the central node. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 20 = 22, which we will denote as [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.
