Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 5 neighbors  
Node 1 has 3 neighbors  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors  
Node 4 has 4 neighbors  
Node 5 has 2 neighbors  
Node 6 has 2 neighbors  
Node 7 has 1 neighbor  
Node 8 has 3 neighbors  
Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 39 \)  
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:  
<0, (3, 4, 5)>  
<0, (3, 4, 8)>  
<0, (3, 4, 9)>  
<0, (3, 5, 9)>  
<0, (4, 5, 6)>  
<0, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (0, 1, 6)>  
<3, (0, 4, 6)>  
<4, (0, 1, 5)>  
<4, (0, 5, 6)>  
<8, (0, 2, 9)>  
<9, (0, 1, 2)>  
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
