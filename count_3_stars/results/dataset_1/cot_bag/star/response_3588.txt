Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of those nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using that node as the center.

From the given information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5). So, there is 1 3-star. <0, (2, 4, 5)>

- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8). So, there is 1 3-star. <1, (3, 6, 8)>

- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5). So, there is 1 3-star. <2, (0, 3, 5)>

- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4). So, there is 1 3-star. <3, (1, 2, 4)>

- Node 4: It has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7, 9). So, there are 5 3-stars. <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>

- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5). So, there is 1 3-star. <5, (0, 2, 5)>

- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (1, 4). It does not form a 3-star.

- Node 7: It has 2 neighbors (4, 9). It does not form a 3-star.

- Node 8: It has 2 neighbors (1, 9). It does not form a 3-star.

- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8). So, there is 1 3-star. <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 5)>.
