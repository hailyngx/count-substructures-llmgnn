Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the following graph:

```
    0 --- 3     6
    |     |     |
    5 --- 8 --- 9
    |     |\
    1 --- 7
    |
    2
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, and 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8

For node 5:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-star configurations:
  - <5, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <5, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <5, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 8:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-star configuration:
  - <8, (3, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 5, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 9:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-star configurations:
  - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18], and the unique configurations are:
<5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>,
<8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>,
<9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
