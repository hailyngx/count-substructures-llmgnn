Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 5, 8)>
<4, (9, 5, 0)>
<4, (9, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 2)>
<6, (2, 8, 4)>
<6, (2, 8, 5)>
<6, (5, 8, 2)>
