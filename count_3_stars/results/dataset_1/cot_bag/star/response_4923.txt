Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: {2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 1: {7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: {5, 7}
Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9}
Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 9}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8}
Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 7}
Node 9: {4, 6}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>

Node 2: [inom{6}{3} = 20]
<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 1)>

Node 4: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
<4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Node 5: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
<5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 3)>

Node 6: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
<6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>

Node 8: [inom{4}{3} = 4]
<8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 1)>

Adding them up, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40].

Therefore, the final answer is [40].
