Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of $10$ nodes. Let's identify which nodes have $3$ or more neighbors:

- Node $0$ has $3$ neighbors.
- Node $1$ has $3$ neighbors.
- Node $2$ has $4$ neighbors.
- Node $4$ has $4$ neighbors.
- Node $6$ has $3$ neighbors.
- Node $8$ has $4$ neighbors.
- Node $9$ has $4$ neighbors.

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node $0$: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node $1$: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node $2$: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node $4$: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node $6$: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node $8$: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node $9$: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: $1+1+4+4+1+4+4 = 19$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $[19]$.

Unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
