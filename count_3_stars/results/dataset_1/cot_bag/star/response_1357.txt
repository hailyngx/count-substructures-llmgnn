Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph is represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8.

We can see that only nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed: <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 1)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>.
For node 1, there is 1 3-star formed: <1, (0, 5, 6)>.
For node 4, there is 1 3-star formed: <4, (0, 6, 3)>.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed: <9, (1, 5, 8)>.

Putting it all together, we have a total of [7] 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 1)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 3)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>.
