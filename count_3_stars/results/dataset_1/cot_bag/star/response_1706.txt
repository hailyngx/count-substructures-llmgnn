Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Looking at the nodes with their respective number of neighbors:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 and Node 2 have 4 neighbors each, so each contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6, Node 7, and Node 9 have 3 neighbors each, so each contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding them up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
