Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 9) --> [1 3-star] <1, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8) --> [1 3-star] <3, (4, 6, 8)>
Node 4: (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9) --> [1 3-star] <4, (3, 7, 8)>
Node 7: (1, 7), (2, 7), (4, 7), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8) --> [1 3-star] <7, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 8: (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (7, 8) --> [1 3-star] <8, (3, 4, 5)>
Node 9: (0, 9), (1, 9), (4, 9) --> [1 3-star] <9, (0, 1, 4)>

There is a total of [6] 3-stars in this graph.
