Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 4)>
<8, (2, 7, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 2, 4)>
<8, (7, 1, 5)>
