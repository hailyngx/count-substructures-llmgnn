Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 27 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final result is [27]. The unique 3-stars are:
