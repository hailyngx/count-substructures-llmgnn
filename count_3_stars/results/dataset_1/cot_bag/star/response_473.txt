Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 9 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <8, 0, 3>
- <8, 0, 5>
- <8, 3, 9>
- <8, 5, 7>
- <8, 7, 2>
