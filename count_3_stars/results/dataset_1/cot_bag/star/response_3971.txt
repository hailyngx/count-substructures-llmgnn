Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

Nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (3, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (4)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 4: 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 8)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (1)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 8) = 8. So, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>,
<8, (0, 7, 1)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (7, 1, 8)>.
