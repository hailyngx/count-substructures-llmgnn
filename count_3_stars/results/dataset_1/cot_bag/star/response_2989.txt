Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 7)}

Now let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 3 has neighbors {0, 4}. This forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4)>
Node 4 has neighbors {3, 8}. This forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 8)>
Node 8 has neighbors {4, 5}. This forms 1 3-star: <8, (4, 5)>
Node 7 has neighbors {6, 9}. This forms 1 3-star: <7, (6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <3, (0, 4)>, <4, (3, 8)>, <8, (4, 5)>, and <7, (6, 9)>.
