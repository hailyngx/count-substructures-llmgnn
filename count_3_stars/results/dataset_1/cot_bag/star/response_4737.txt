Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [12] \).

The unique 3-stars are: 

- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
