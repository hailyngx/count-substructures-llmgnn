Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 2 neighbors (1, 7). So, it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8). So, it forms one 3-star.
- Node 4: It has 2 neighbors (7, 9). So, it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 5). So, it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 6). So, it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9). So, it forms one 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors (4, 8). So, it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) = 10

So, the final number of 3-stars = [10].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (5, 6, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
