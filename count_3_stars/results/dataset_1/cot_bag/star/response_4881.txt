Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: 
- It has the neighbors 2, 3, 7, 8, 9.
- Total 3-stars with node 1 = $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
  
Node 2:
- It has the neighbors 1, 3, 6, 9.
- Total 3-stars with node 2 = $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

Node 3:
- It has the neighbors 0, 1, 2, 6, 8.
- Total 3-stars with node 3 = $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

Node 6:
- It has the neighbors 2, 3, 4.
- Total 3-stars with node 6 = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$

Node 7:
- It has the neighbors 1, 4, 5.
- Total 3-stars with node 7 = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$

Node 8:
- It has the neighbors 1, 3.
- Total 3-stars with node 8 = $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

Adding up all the 3-stars obtained for each node gives a total of $10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 26$.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $[26]$.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
