Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to node 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.

To identify the 3-stars, we need to find nodes with three or more neighbors. Nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8 meet this criterion. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16]. The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>.
