Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of them.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Node 7 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.

Node 9 has 7 neighbors, so it forms 35 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 35 = 55.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (9, 0, 2)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 0, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 0, 1)>, <9, (2, 0, 5)>, <9, (2, 1, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 1)>, <9, (2, 8, 1)>, <9, (2, 8, 3)>, <9, (2, 8, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 4)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>.
