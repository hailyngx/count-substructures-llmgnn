Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes and their neighbors based on the provided edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5
- Node 7 is connected to node 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7

Next, we will find the nodes that have three or more neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 24 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
