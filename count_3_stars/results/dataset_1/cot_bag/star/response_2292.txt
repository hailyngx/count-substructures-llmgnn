Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To analyze this graph, let's first list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 17 \) 3-stars formed in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>.
