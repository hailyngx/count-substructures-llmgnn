Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Each node and their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 7: {1, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 4}

We'll now identify the 3-stars and count them.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {0, 5, 6}
- Number of 3-stars with Node 1 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 6)>

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
- Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 7}
- Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7]

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>
