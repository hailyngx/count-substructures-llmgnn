Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- For node 0, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 8, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 39 \).

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 2, 5)>
- <0, (6, 2, 5)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (5, 9, 0)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
