Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 5, 8
- 1 is connected to 2, 3, 4, 5
- 2 is connected to 1, 5, 8, 9
- 3 is connected to 1
- 4 is connected to 1, 8, 9
- 5 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- 6 is connected to 7, 8
- 7 is connected to 5, 6, 8
- 8 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- 9 is connected to 2, 4, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 5, 8: <2, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 8, 9: <4, (1, 8, 9)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 1, 2: <5, (0, 1, 2)> and with neighbors 5, 7, 8: <5, (7, 8, 5)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 2, 5: <8, (0, 2, 5)>, neighbors 1, 4, 5: <8, (1, 4, 5)>, and neighbors 6, 7, 9: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [6]
