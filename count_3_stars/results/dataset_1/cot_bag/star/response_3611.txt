Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the neighbors of each node to find the 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, and 8. 
  The number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
  <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 3)>.

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 7. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 6. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 4.
  The number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
  <3, (0, 6, 4)>.

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 6.
  The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
  <4, (1, 5, 6)>.

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
  The number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 2)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 7, 8)>.

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
  The number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <6, (7, 0, 3)>.

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9.
  The number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (6, 9, 0)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (9, 0, 5)>.

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 5. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 7. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [36].
