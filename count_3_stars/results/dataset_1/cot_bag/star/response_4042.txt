Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 16 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 9, 0)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
5. <4, (3, 7, 8)>
6. <6, (3, 9, 0)>
7. <7, (4, 8, 9)>
8. <8, (3, 4, 7)>
9. <9, (0, 1, 2)>
10. <0, (1, 9, 3)>
11. <1, (0, 9, 2)>
12. <2, (1, 9, 0)>
13. <3, (0, 8, 4)>
14. <4, (3, 7, 8)>
15. <6, (3, 9, 0)>
16. <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].
