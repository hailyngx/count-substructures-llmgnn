Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors and thus do not form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 3-stars.
\[ [52] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
