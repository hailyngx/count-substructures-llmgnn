Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 7)
(1, 2), (1, 3)
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5)
(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7)
(4, 5), (4, 6)
(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)
(6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9)
(7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9)
(9, 6), (9, 7)

Now let's identify the 3-star formations:

Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 7)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 4)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 6)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 7, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
