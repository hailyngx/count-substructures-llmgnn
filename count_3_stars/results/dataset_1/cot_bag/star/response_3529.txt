Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Using the information provided, we can construct the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Next, we determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <1, (6, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (8, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 1, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 8)>, <8, (6, 1, 3)>
