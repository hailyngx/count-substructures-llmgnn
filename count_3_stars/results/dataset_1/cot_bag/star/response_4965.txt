Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first determine for each node how many 3-stars it is a part of. Since the graph has 10 nodes, we will analyze each node in the graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7). So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
Node 1 has 2 neighbors. It cannot form any 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6). So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor. It cannot form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors. It cannot form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors. It cannot form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9 \). 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, and <5, (1, 2, 4)>.
