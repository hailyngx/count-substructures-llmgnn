Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 26 edges:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9    
Edges:  
(0, 6), (0, 8)  
(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6)  
(2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9)  
(3, 8)  
(4, 1), (4, 5)  
(5, 4)  
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9)  
(7, 8), (7, 9)  
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7)  
(9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)  

Now let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:  

For node 0: Has 2 neighbors (6, 8)  
For node 1: Has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6)  
For node 2: Has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9)  
For node 3: Has 1 neighbor (8)  
For node 4: Has 2 neighbors (1, 5)  
For node 5: Has 1 neighbor (4)  
For node 6: Has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9)  
For node 7: Has 2 neighbors (8, 9)  
For node 8: Has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 7)  
For node 9: Has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:  
Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0  
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 3: 0  
Node 4: 0  
Node 5: 0  
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 7: 0  
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10  
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 17  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 17, which can be represented as [17].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>.
