Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Nodes 7 and 8 each forms only 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 28, and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)> 

So, the final answer is [28].
