Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 7, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 6 (2 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 7 (2 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 7, 8 (2 neighbors)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 = 11, which can be written as [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
