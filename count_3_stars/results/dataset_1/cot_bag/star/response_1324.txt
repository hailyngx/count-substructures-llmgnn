Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [14] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
