Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we'll first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. 
Based on the information provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 5.
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- 3-star with node 0 as center: <0, (1, 3, 5)>.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- 3-stars with node 1 as center: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- 3-stars with node 3 as center: <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- 3-stars with node 5 as center: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- 3-stars with node 7 as center: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- 3-stars with node 8 as center: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4] = 43. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>.
