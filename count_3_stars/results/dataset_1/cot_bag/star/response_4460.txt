Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0 and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:
For node 0, there are 2 other nodes it is connected to (5 and 7), so it forms 1 3-star with these nodes.
For node 7, there are 4 other nodes it is connected to (0, 2, 4, and 7), so it forms 4 3-stars with these nodes.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4] = 5.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (5, 7)> and <7, (0, 2, 4)>.
So, the final answer is [5] with the 3-stars <0, (5, 7)> and <7, (0, 2, 4)>.
