Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

So, there are 14 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 5, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 2, 9)>, <5, (6, 4, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 2)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 2, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].
