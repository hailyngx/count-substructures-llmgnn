Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:   
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8  
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Summing these, we get \( [4 + 10] = [14] \).   
The unique 3-stars are:   
<0, (4, 5, 6)>  
<0, (4, 5, 8)>  
<0, (4, 6, 8)>  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<8, (0, 1, 4)>  
<8, (0, 1, 9)>  
<8, (0, 4, 9)>  
<8, (1, 4, 9)>  
<8, (0, 4, 5)>  
<8, (0, 4, 6)>  
<8, (0, 4, 9)>  
<8, (4, 5, 9)>  
<8, (4, 6, 9)>  
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
