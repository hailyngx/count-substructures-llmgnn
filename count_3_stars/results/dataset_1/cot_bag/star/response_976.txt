Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7

Let's determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [<2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>]
- Node 3: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star formed (has only 1 neighbor)
- Node 5: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-star formed (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [<9, (0, 3, 5)>]

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 2 + 1] = 4. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, and <9, (0, 3, 5)>.

So the final answer is [4].
