Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 2 neighbors
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 2 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 7: 1 neighbor
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of the nodes with three or more neighbors.

Total 3-stars:
\[ [ \binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{9}{3} ]\]

Calculating the values:
\[ [\binom{0}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{9}{3} ] = [0 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 56 + 84] = [165] \]

Therefore, there are 165 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
