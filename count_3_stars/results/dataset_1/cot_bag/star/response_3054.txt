Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
