Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's examine each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, there are a total of [1+1+1+1] = [4] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
