Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 9)  
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (1, 8)  
Node 5 has 2 neighbors (0, 1)  

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
<1, (2, 4, 5)>  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>  
<1, (4, 5, 9)> 

Node 1 has 4 possible 3-stars.

Since nodes 4 and 5 have less than 3 neighbors, they do not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, so the answer is [4].
