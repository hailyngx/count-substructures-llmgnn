Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential centers of 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7 have three or more neighbors. 

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

Node 0: 
    Total neighbors: 2 (nodes 3 and 9)
    Number of 3-stars: 0

Node 3: 
    Total neighbors: 4 (nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>

Node 4: 
    Total neighbors: 4 (nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7)
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 7: 
    Total neighbors: 2 (nodes 1 and 4)
    Number of 3-stars: 0

Putting the results together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [0 + 4 + 4 + 0] = [8] \).
The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>,
<4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>
