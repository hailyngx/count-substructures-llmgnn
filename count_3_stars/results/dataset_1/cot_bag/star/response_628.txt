Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the nodes and the edges provided:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {1, 3, 4}
- 1: {0, 3}
- 2: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- 3: {0, 1, 2}
- 4: {0, 2}
- 5: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- 6: {5, 7, 8}
- 7: {6, 8}
- 8: {5, 6, 7}
- 9: {2, 5}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 11 3-stars in this graph: [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
