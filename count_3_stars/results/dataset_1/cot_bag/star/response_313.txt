Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of 32 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (4, 8, 6)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].
