Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
- 3-stars: [<0, (5, 8, 9)>]

For node 2:
- 3-stars: []

For node 4:
- 3-stars: [<4, (2, 5, 7)>]

For node 5:
- 3-stars: []

For node 8:
- 3-stars: []

For node 9:
- 3-stars: []

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
