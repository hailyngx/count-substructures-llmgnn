Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors.

From the given edges, we can determine the neighbor counts for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
