Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 7, and node 9.

For node 0, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Since node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, and 7, the unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>.

For node 7, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. Since node 7 has neighbors 0, 2, 8, and 9, the unique 3-stars are: <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>.

For node 9, we can form \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars because it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
