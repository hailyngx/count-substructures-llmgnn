Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6

Based on the number of neighbors each node has, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars.

For Node 1, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

For Node 2, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

For Node 5, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

For Node 6, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

For Node 7, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

For Node 9, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [18].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 4)>.
