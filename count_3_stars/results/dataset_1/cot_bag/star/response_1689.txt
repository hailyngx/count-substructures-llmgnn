Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: $inom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 1: $inom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 2: $inom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21 \]

So, the final answer is: [21]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 6)>
