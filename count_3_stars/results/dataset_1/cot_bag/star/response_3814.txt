Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
```
  1 -- 7 -- 3 -- 5 -- 9
  |    |    |         |
  8 -- 0 -- 2         6
  |         |
  4         |
            |
```

Now, we'll identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, inside brackets [] we have a total of 2 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
- <0, 2, 8>
- <8, 0, 1>
