Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 8

Node 0, Node 4, and Node 5 each have more than three neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, and <5, (1, 2, 4)>.
