Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node  2: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5

Following our method, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: [5].

Therefore, the 3-stars in this graph are:  
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>.
