Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7)
Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6)
Node 3: 2 neighbors (2, 9)
Node 4: 2 neighbors (6, 8)
Node 5: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 6)
Node 6: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7)
Node 7: 2 neighbors (0, 6)
Node 8: 1 neighbor (4)
Node 9: 1 neighbor (3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up these counts gives us a total of 36 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [36].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>

<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
