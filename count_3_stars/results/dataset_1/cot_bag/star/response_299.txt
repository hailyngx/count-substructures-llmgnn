Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30 \) 3-stars.

So, the final answer is [30].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
