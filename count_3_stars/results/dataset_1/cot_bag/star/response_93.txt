Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to node 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 9 is connected to node 2

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
   - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <2, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <2, (5, 8, 9)>
   - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
   
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
   - <5, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (2, 8, 6)>

- Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   - <6, (2, 3, 7)>

- Node 8 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (as it only has 2 neighbors)

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 1] = 9.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
   - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <2, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <2, (5, 8, 9)>
   - <2, (6, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (2, 8, 6)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
