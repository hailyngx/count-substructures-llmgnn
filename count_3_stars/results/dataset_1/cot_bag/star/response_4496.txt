Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 1, 5, 6, and 8, giving it 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 6, 7, and 9, giving it 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has neighbors 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9, giving it 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 4, 6, and 9, giving it 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has neighbors 4, 6, 7, and 8, giving it 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32.

So, the final answer is [32]. The unique 3-stars are:

- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 1)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (1, 6, 0)>
- <3, (0, 5, 1)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 4)>
- <6, (4, 7, 1)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (1, 9, 4)>
- <6, (4, 9, 1)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 9, 7)>
- <6, (7, 9, 1)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 9, 7)>
- <6, (7, 9, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 4)>
- <7, (4, 6, 1)>
- <9, (4, 7, 6)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (7, 6, 4)>
- <9, (4, 6, 1)>
