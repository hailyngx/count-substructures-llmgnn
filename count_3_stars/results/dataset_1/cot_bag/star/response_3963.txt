Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6, 9)
Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7, 8)
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8, 9)
Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 8)
Node 8 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 9)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50]. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (8, 7, 0)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (8, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 6, 2)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>
<8, (9, 1, 0)>
<8, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
