Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 7
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 11 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>.
