Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Looking at the list of edges given, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up: 
Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 8) + 20 (from node 9) = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 9, 2)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (6, 0, 7)>
<8, (9, 0, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (5, 3, 8)>
<9, (8, 0, 2)>
