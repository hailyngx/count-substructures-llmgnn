Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 1, Node 5

For Node 1:
- Node 1 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph would be: 10 + 20 = 30.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 5, 9)>
