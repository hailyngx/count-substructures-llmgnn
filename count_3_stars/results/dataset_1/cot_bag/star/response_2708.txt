Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 7 neighbors: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

For node 4:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 5:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 7:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Add up the total number of 3-stars: \(35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48\)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
