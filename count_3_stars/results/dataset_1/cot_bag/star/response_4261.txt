Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges as a graph with 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9.  

The graph can be visualized as follows:
```
    1 -- 0 -- 8
   / \  /|\ 
  4    3 2 9
   \ / |/   
    7 -- 5   
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:  

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors (2, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
9. Node 8 has 2 neighbors (0, 2), so it cannot form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
