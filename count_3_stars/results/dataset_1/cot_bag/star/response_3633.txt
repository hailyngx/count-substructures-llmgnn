Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3

We see that nodes 0, 3, and 8 have at least 3 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, and <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
