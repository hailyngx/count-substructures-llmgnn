Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph is as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8)

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph by applying the mentioned method. 

For each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8 -> [1 3-star] -> <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7 -> [1 3-star] -> <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 9 -> [1 3-star] -> <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1] = [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>.
