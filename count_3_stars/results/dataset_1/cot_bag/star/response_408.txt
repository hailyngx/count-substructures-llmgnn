Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Let's analyze the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 7.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 7.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 0.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 7.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 3, 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 33 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
