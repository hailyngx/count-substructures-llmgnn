Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9.  

For node 0: 
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.  
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 2: 
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.  
<2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 4: 
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.  
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 5: 
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.   
<5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>

For node 6: 
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.  
<6, (0, 1, 4)>

For node 9: 
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.  
<9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 18.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].
