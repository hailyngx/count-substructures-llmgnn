Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

```
   1 -- 6 -- 7                  0 -- 4 -- 3
   |    |    |                  |    |    |
   8 -- 5 -- 2                 9                 (center node)
       |                         | 
       6                          0
```

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, and 6.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>.

So, the final result is [4].
