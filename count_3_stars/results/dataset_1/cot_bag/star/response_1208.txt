Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually based on the given edges:
```
0 -- 1 -- 3 -- 9
|         |  
4         2 -- 5
|         |
6 --------6 -- 7
          |
          8
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 18 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 1)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 1, 4)>
