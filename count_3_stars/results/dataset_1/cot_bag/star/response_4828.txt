Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to see if it can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8: It has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

So, a total of [1 + 1 + 1] = 3 3-stars can be formed in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
