Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

To find the number of 3-stars for each node, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we get a total of 32 3-stars. So, the final answer is [32].

Unique 3-stars:

- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>

- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
