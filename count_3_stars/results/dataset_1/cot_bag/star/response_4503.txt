Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Here is the list of nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 9) = 9.  

So, the final answer is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
