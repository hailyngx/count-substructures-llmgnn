Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (8, 9)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (4, 9)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
