Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5
Node 1: 0, 8
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 2, 7
Node 4: 0, 6, 8
Node 5: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 4, 5
Node 7: 3, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 5

Now, let's go through each node that has at least 3 neighbors to count the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
So, the number of 3-stars for Node 0 = inom{3}{3} = 1

For Node 4:
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
So, the number of 3-stars for Node 4 = inom{3}{3} = 1

For Node 5:
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 8, 9
So, the number of 3-stars for Node 5 = inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the 3-stars from each node:
1 + 1 + 4 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
