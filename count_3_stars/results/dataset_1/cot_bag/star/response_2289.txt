Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the calculation and solution for the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 9. Hence, node 0 can form 3-stars with each set of 3 neighbors. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
  <0, (4, 5, 9)>

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 8, and 9. Similar to node 0, node 4 can form 3-stars with each set of 3 neighbors. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
  <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, 
  <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 6. As with the previous nodes, node 5 can form 3-stars with each set of 3 neighbors. Therefore, the number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
  <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: \( [1 + 10 + 4] = [15] \)
