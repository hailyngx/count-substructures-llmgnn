Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 15 nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 24 \) total 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [24].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 9, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<0, (8, 1, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 3)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
