Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes and 22 edges in the graph given. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 5}
Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 7, 9}
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 6}
Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 8}
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
