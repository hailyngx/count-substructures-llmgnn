Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Since only nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 8)>

For Node 6:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 8, 9)>

For Node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <7, (5, 8, 3)>

For Node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

When we sum up the total number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 5 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
