Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 1: has 1 neighbor
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors
- Node 7: has 1 neighbor
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors

Nodes 4, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

For node 4, we can form 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8).
For node 8, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars since it has 4 neighbors: (4, 5, 9), (4, 5, 8), (5, 9, 8), (4, 8, 9).
For node 9, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors (5, 8, 9).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 6.

So, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars are <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>.
