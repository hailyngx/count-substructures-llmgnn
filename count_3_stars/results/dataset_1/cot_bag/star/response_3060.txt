Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
- Node 0: 4, 7  
- Node 2: 9  
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8, 9  
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9  
- Node 5: 3, 4  
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4  
- Node 8: 3  
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, no 3-stars form.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, no 3-stars form.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors, which can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors, which can form 4 unique 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, no 3-stars form.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, there is 1 way to choose 3 neighbors, which forms 1 unique 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, no 3-stars form.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, there is 1 way to choose 3 neighbors, which forms 1 unique 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (3, 7, 9)>,
<4, (5, 7, 9)>,
<7, (0, 3, 4)>,
<7, (0, 4, 9)>,
<7, (3, 4, 9)>,
<7, (4, 9, 3)>,
<9, (2, 3, 4)>,
<9, (3, 4, 2)>.
