Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars, we will first find the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can potentially form 3-stars. 

From the list of edges provided, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 5

Nodes 0, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

For node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 7:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 8:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Adding these together, we get \( 10 + 4 + 20 = 34 \). So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (8, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
