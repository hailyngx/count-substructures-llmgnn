Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors based on the provided edge list:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 1, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 7, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For nodes with 3 neighbors, there are no 3-stars formed.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for the nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
                  
Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
