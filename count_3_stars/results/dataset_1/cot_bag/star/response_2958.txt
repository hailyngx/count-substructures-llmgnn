Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Node 7 has only 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 29 \). Therefore, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
