Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>
