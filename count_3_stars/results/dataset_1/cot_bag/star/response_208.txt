Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes:
- Node 0 with neighbors: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1 with neighbors: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2 with neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3 with neighbors: 5, 8
- Node 4 with neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5 with neighbors: 1, 3, 4
- Node 6 with neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 8 with neighbors: 3, 4

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
