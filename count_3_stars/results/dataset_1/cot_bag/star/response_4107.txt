Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Based on the number of neighbors each node has, we can identify which nodes can form 3-stars.
Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 

Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32 \)  

Therefore, there are 32 3-stars in total.  

Unique 3-stars:  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<1, (3, 5, 7)>  
<1, (8, 4, 5)>  
<1, (9, 0, 6)>  
<4, (2, 5, 7)>  
<5, (2, 4, 7)>  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  
<8, (1, 4, 5)>  
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
