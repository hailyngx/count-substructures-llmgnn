Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (2, 4)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (3, 7)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (6, 9)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \) [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
