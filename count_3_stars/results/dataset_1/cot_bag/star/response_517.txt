Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
For node 1: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
For node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
For node 5: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
For node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
For node 8: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of $4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18$ 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
