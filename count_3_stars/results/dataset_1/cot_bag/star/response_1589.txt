Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9 have 6, 3, 5, and 3 neighbors respectively. 
Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes, we get:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 32.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
