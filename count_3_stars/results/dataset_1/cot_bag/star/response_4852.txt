Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {6, 8}

Now let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 8: inom{7}{3} = 35
Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 35 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<6, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<8, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
