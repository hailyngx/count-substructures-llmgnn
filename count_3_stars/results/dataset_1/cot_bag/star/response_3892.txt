Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: 
Node 0 with 5 neighbors, and node 9 with 6 neighbors. 

For node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed, giving us a total of 10 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars formed, giving us a total of 20 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 20 = 30 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
