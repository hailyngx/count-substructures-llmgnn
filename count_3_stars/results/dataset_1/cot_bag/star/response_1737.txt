Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (3, 9)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 6)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 5, 8)>  
<1, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (5, 6, 8)>  
<2, (5, 6, 9)>  
<2, (6, 7, 9)>  
<2, (5, 8, 9)>  
<3, (7, 6, 8)>  
<6, (2, 5, 9)>  
<6, (9, 1, 2)>  
<6, (7, 2, 5)>  
<6, (2, 5, 6)>  
<9, (1, 2, 6)>  
<9, (2, 4, 6)>  
<9, (6, 2, 5)>  
<9, (6, 4, 9)>
