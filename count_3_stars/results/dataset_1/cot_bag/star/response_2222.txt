Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, and 8. The number of 3-stars centered at node 2 can be calculated as \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, and 9. The number of 3-stars centered at node 3 can be calculated as \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, and 9. The number of 3-stars centered at node 7 can be calculated as \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 3-stars in the given graph. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
