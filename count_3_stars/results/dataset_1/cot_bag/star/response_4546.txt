Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node that has at least three neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 8.
Since Node 0 can form a 3-star with each set of 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving Node 0 is inom{3}{3} = 1.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 6.
Since Node 1 can form a 3-star with each set of 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving Node 1 is inom{4}{3} = 4.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 4.
Since Node 2 can form a 3-star with each set of 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving Node 2 is inom{3}{3} = 1.

Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, and 9.
Since Node 4 can form a 3-star with each set of 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving Node 4 is inom{4}{3} = 4.

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, and 9.
Since Node 5 can form a 3-star with each set of 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving Node 5 is inom{4}{3} = 4.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 7.
Since Node 6 can form a 3-star with each set of 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving Node 6 is inom{4}{3} = 4.

Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, and 9.
Since Node 9 can form a 3-star with each set of 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving Node 9 is inom{4}{3} = 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 22.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

So, the final answer is [22].
