Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph you provided has the following structure:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 6), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (9, 6)}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Only Node 6 has 4 or more neighbors, which means we need to calculate the number of 3-stars around Node 6. 

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to Node 6, where n is the number of neighbors of Node 6:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, there are 4 3-stars centered at Node 6.

Putting this number inside brackets, we have [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <6, (2, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 2, 9)>
- <6, (9, 2, 5)>
- <6, (9, 5, 2)>
