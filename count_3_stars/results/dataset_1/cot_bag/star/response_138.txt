Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

Node 0: 8, 9
Node 1: 3, 8
Node 2: 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: 3, 7, 9
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 6 has only 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 0)>, <8, (7, 9, 3)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>, <8, (9, 0, 3)>, <8, (9, 0, 4)>, <8, (9, 3, 4)>, <8, (9, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>
