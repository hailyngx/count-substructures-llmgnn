Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, as those are the only ones that can form 3-stars.

Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 9)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (0, 5)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9)
Node 5: 2 neighbors (2, 9)
Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 8)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
