Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph.
The 10 nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to node 5
- Node 5 is connected to node 4
- Node 6 is connected to node 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

For node 0: It has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 2: It has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
<2, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 3: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. 
<3, (0, 2, 8)>

For node 8: It has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 9: It has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 7, 8), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 23 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].
