Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can represent the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 7)]

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1:
- 3 neighbors: 3, 7 (forming one 3-star) -> <1, (3, 7)>
Total: [1]

For node 3:
- 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7 (forming four 3-stars) -> <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>
Total: [1 + 4 = 5]

For node 5:
- 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 8 (forming four 3-stars) -> <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>
Total: [5 + 4 = 9]

For node 7:
- 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9 (forming ten 3-stars) -> <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>
Total: [9 + 10 = 19]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].
