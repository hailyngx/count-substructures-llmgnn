Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1, there are 2 3-stars starting with this node (with nodes 3, 9, and 5).
For node 2, there are 1 3-stars starting with this node (with nodes 3, 6, and 8).
For node 3, there is 1 3-star starting with this node (with nodes 1, 2, and 8).
For node 8, there is 1 3-star starting with this node (with nodes 2, 3, and 9).
For node 9, there are 2 3-stars starting with this node (with nodes 1, 8, and 5).

Adding these up, we have a total of 7 3-stars. 

Thus, the final count for the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 9, 5)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>
