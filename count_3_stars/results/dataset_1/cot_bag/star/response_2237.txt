Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \sum_{i=0}^{9}\binom{d_i}{3} = \binom{5}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 3-stars in total. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:

\[ \langle (0, 2, 3, 9), (2, 3, 7, 9), (3, 0, 5, 9), (3, 1, 8, -), (3, 2, 5, 9), (4, 0, 7, -), (5, 0, 2, -), (6, 2, 9, -), (7, 2, 3, 9), (8, 1, 4, -) \rangle \] 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
