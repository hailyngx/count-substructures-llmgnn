Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Node 1 and Node 9 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors, so we calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 20 = 30 \), so the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 9, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 8, 7)>

<9, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 9, 8)>
<9, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (7, 9, 8)>
<9, (7, 9, 9)>
<9, (8, 8, 9)>
<9, (8, 9, 9)>
