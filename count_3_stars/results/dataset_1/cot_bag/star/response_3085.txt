Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
With the given graph, let's determine the number of 3-stars and list them.

Starting with the node degrees:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Node 0, 1, 4, 6 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-star.

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ [] = (1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0) = 7 \]

So, there are 7 total 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-star combinations are:
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 0, 6)>
<5, (2, 0, 8)>
<5, (6, 0, 2)>
