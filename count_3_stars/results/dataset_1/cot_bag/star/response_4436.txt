Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph visually:

```
   0 -- 8
   |     |
   1 -- 2
   |  /  |
   4 -- 7
  /|  |  |\
  5 -- 6 -- 7
```

Now, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 4, 5.
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 7, 5.
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 6, 6.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which we represent as [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 7, 5)>
- <5, (1, 6, 6)>
