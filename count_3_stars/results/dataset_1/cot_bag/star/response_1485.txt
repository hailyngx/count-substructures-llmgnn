Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
1. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since it has only 2 neighbors)
4. Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since it has only 2 neighbors)
5. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4]\).
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (4, 1, 6)>, and <9, (2, 3, 9)>.
