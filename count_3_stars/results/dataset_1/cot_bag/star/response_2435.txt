Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

For node 0:
There are 4 neighbors of node 0: nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 

For node 1:
There are 3 neighbors of node 1: nodes 0, 2, and 5.
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 2:
There are 2 neighbors of node 2: nodes 1 and 9.
Node 2 doesn't have enough neighbors to form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \).
Thus, the answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
