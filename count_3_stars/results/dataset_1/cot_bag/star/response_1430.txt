Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars, let's first look at the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 7)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (0, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (4, 6)

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11 \) 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>,
<0, (3, 5, 7)>,
<0, (4, 5, 7)>,
<2, (3, 6, 7)>,
<3, (0, 2, 6)>,
<3, (0, 2, 7)>,
<3, (0, 6, 7)>,
<3, (2, 6, 7)>,
<6, (2, 3, 8)>,
<7, (0, 2, 3)>.
