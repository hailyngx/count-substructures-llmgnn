Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 3, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 8: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
- So, there are 56 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- So, there are 10 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- So, there are 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Summing up the number of 3-stars, we have a total of \( [56 + 10 + 4] = [70] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
