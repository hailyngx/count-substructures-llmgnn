Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
   0 -- 8           1 -- 3     6
        |            |\ /      |
        |            | X       |
        |            |/ \      |
        8 -- 6 -- 7 -- 2 -- 5
        |    |         |
        |    |         |
        |    |         |
        1 -- 3 -- 9
```

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 1 has three neighbors: (3, 6, 8)
- Node 2 has four neighbors: (3, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 3 has five neighbors: (1, 2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 6 has four neighbors: (1, 2, 7, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
