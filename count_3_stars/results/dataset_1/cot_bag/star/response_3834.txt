Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph using the method explained earlier:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 28 \)

Therefore, there are 28 3-stars in this graph.
