Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 8 (Degree = 2)
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 7 (Degree = 2)
Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 7, 8 (Degree = 3)
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 7 (Degree = 2)
Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 6 (Degree = 2)
Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4 (Degree = 3)
Node 6 has neighbors: 4 (Degree = 1)
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3 (Degree = 3)
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2 (Degree = 2)

Now, we find the 3-stars:

For Node 2:
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>

For Node 5:
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars = 2

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
