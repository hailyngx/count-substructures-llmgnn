Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 3, 4, 9.

For node 3:
From its 5 neighbors, we can form 4 different 3-stars. Thus, we have [4].
The unique 3-stars involving node 3 are: <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>.

For node 4:
From its 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star. Thus, we have [1].
The unique 3-star involving node 4 is: <4, (2, 5, 7)>.

For node 9:
From its 3 neighbors, we can form 1 3-star. Thus, we have [1].
The unique 3-star involving node 9 is: <9, (1, 3, 6)>.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = [6].
