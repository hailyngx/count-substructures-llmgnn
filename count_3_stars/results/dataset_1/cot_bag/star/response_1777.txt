Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, and 8. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, and 7. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, and 7. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, and 8. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, and 7. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 3-stars in this graph, and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>

So, the final answer is [7].
