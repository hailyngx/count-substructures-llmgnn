Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (0, 6, 9)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 6, 7)
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes 2, 6, and 8 (the nodes with three or more neighbors):

- Node 2: There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \).

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
