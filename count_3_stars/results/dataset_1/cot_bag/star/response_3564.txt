Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, we have the following nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is fewer than 3.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up: \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18 \)

So, there are [18] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <3, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 3, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
6. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
7. <4, (3, 9, 8)>
8. <4, (5, 8, 9)>
9. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
10. <6, (4, 5, 8)>
11. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
12. <6, (4, 8, 9)>
13. <9, (3, 4, 6)>
14. <9, (4, 6, 8)>
15. <9, (4, 6, 5)>
16. <9, (4, 6, 3)>
17. <9, (2, 4, 6)>
18. <9, (2, 4, 3)>
