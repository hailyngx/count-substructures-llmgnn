Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes and each node can form a 3-star if it has three or more neighbors, let's examine each node to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed with it:

- **Node 0** has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1** has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 8), allowing it to form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- **Node 2** has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 8), allowing it to form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- **Node 3** has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 4** has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5** has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7** has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5), allowing it to form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- **Node 8** has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9), allowing it to form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- **Node 9** has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 \). 

<1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)> are the unique 3-stars found. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].
