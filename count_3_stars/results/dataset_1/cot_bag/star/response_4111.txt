Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 30 3-stars in this graph, which we represent as [30].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, and <7, (0, 4, 8)>.
