Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 2

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with more than 3 neighbors:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
