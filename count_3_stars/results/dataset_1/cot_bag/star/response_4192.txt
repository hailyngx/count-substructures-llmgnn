Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are certain nodes that have 3 or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify those nodes and then find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Only 1 3-star can be formed with Node 0)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 43

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
