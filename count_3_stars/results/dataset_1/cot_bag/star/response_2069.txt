Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which means we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. Here are the calculations:

Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we get a total of 28 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
