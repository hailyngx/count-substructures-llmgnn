Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Therefore, we have the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: [1] => []  (since it only has 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: [1] => []  (since it only has 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: [1] => []  (since it only has 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: [1] => []  (since it only has 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: [1] => []  (since it only has 1 neighbor)
- Node 6: [1] => []  (since it only has 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: [3] => <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: [1] => []  (since it only has 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: [1] => []  (since it only has 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
