Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are 34 3-stars in total in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (2, 9, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 0)>
<9, (2, 6, 0)> 

Putting the final count in brackets: [34]
