Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 6, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 6, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors 5, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors 2, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 1, 5
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (with neighbors 4, 6, 8)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (with neighbors 5, 8, 9)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (with neighbors 4, 7, 8) and (with neighbors 4, 8, 9) and (with neighbors 7, 8, 9) and (with neighbors 4, 7, 9)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (with neighbors 0, 1, 5)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (with neighbors 0, 1, 2) and (with neighbors 1, 2, 3) and (with neighbors 0, 2, 3) and (with neighbors 0, 1, 3)

The total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
