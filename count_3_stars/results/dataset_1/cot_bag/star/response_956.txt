Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {3, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Based on the given information, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For Node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 4, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For Node 6, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: \( 4 + 10 + 0 = 14 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
