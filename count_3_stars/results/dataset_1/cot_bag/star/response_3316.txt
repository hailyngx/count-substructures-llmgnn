Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (1, 5, 6, 7)
  Total 3-stars for node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 5, 6)
  Total 3-stars for node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 3, 4, 7)
  Total 3-stars for node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 3, 4, 7)
  Total 3-stars for node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (0, 3, 5, 6, 8)
  Total 3-stars for node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (4, 6, 7, 9)
  Total 3-stars for node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
