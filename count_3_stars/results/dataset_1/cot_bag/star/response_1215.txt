Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that they form:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 7 -> \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 9, 5 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8, 7 -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 9, 5 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (less than 3)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 6 -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, there are a total of 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23 3-stars in this graph. 

Inside brackets []: 23
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
