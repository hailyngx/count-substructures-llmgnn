Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)
  - Total possible 3-stars from node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - Unique 3-stars from node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8)
  - Total possible 3-stars from node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars from node 1: <1, (0, 5, 8)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8)
  - Total possible 3-stars from node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars from node 4: <4, (0, 7, 8)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7)
  - Total possible 3-stars from node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars from node 5: <5, (0, 1, 7)>

- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4)
  - Total possible 3-stars from node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars from node 8: <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].
