Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars.

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 20 + 10] = 50 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
