Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, one 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, one 3-star)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (four 3-stars possible)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, one 3-star)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors, one 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8

So, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<4, (6, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 3)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
