Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
We'll start by representing the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to node 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
- Node 9 is connected to node 7

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 5

Number of 3-stars at node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
<5, (4, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
