Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
