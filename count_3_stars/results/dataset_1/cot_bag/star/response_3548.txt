Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than three neighbors in this graph, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 0, there are 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 0. 

For node 1, there are 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8. So, there are also \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars centered at node 1.

For node 4, there are 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars centered at node 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 10 + 20] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<1, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 9)>.
