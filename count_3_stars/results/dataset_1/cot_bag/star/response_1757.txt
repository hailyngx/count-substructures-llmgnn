Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of these nodes.

In this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: 
\[ [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 38 \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (8, 9, 1)>
- <0, (9, 8, 1)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 9, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 5)>
- <8, (5, 6, 1)>
- <8, (6, 5, 1)>
- <9, (3, 4, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 4)>
- <9, (3, 7, 4)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 6)>
- <9, (6, 7, 4)>
- <9, (7, 6, 4)>
- <9, (6, 7, 3)>
- <9, (7, 6, 3)> 

So the final answer is: [38].
