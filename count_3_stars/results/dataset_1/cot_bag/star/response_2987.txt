Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges:

```
     0 -- 5        4 -- 9
      \            /
       \          /
        5 -- 0   8
          \    /
           \  /
            0
             \
              \
           6 -- 2 -- 7
            |   |   |
            |   |   |
            3   7   1
             \ / \ /
              6--8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to count the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors (not counted)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (not counted)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (not counted)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (not counted)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (not counted)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (not counted)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (not counted)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
