Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 3-stars.
Therefore, the final result is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
