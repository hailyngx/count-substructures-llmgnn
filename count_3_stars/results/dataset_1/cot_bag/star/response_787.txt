Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors (5, 8), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7), so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (2, 6), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors (0, 7), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (1, 4), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 \]

Putting this final number inside brackets:
\[ [6] \]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
\[ <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)> \]
