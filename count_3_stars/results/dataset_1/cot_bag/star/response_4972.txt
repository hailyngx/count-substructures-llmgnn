Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
          1
         / \
        5   9
         \ /|
          2 |
         /| |
        8 | |
         \| |
          3 |
         / \|
        4   7
         \ /
          0
```

Next, let's analyze each node to determine how many 3-stars are formed with that node as the center:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:

\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 42 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 42, which can be represented as [42].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
- <0, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 8, 9>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <8, 9, 2>
- <8, 9, 3>
- <9, 3, 4>
