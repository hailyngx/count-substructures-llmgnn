Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
