Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:  
Node 0 has degree 2  
Node 1 has degree 8  
Node 2 has degree 3  
Node 3 has degree 2  
Node 4 has degree 4  
Node 5 has degree 1  
Node 6 has degree 3  
Node 7 has degree 3  
Node 9 has degree 4  

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with degree 3 or more:  
For node 1: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)  
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding these up:  
Total number of 3-stars = \( 56 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 66 \)  

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [66].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (0, 2, 6)>  
<1, (3, 4, 5)>  
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
