Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 25
So, the total number of 3-stars is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
