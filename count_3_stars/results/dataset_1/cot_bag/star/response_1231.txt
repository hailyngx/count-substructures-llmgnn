Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (6, 2), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 1)

Now, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)
Number of 3-stars with node 1: 1

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)
Number of 3-stars with node 2: 1

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 7)
Number of 3-stars with node 7: 1

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 7), (7, 8)
Number of 3-stars with node 8: 1

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so we write it inside brackets [].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>

So, the final representation is: [4], <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>
