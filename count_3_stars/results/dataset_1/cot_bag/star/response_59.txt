Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 4 is connected to node 2
- Node 6 is connected to node 2
- Node 7 is connected to node 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors -> [ 1 3-star ]
Node 1 has 3 neighbors -> [ 1 3-star ]
Node 2 has 4 neighbors -> [ 4 3-stars ]
Node 8 has 3 neighbors -> [ 1 3-star ]
Node 9 has 2 neighbors -> [ 0 3-star ]

Summing up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
