Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 39

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)> <1, (0, 6, 7)> <6, (1, 5, 7)> <7, (0, 1, 6)> <8, (2, 6, 9)> <9, (0, 3, 4)>
