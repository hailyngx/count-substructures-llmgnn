Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9
- 3-stars: [1]

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 2, 8
- 3-stars: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
