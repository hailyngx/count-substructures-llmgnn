Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19

So, there are 19 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<5, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<7, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (8, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
