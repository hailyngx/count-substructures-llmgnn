Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 8)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 9)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 8)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15 \)

There are a total of 15 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- <9, (4, 8, 5)>
- <9, (8, 5, 4)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
