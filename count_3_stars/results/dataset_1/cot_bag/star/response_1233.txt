Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
We start by identifying nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (0, 5, 9): 3 * 1 = 3 3-stars
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 8): 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each

So, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 4*4 = 19].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>
