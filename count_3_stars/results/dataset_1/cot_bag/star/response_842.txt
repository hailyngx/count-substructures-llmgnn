Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph visually for better understanding:

```
   0 --- 3 --- 7
   |      |     |
   8      2     5
    \    / \   / 
       4    6 --- 9
        \  /       
          1
```

From the graph, we observe that only nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes participate in.

For node 2, it has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}. Hence, the number of 3-stars for node 2 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 3, it has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}. So, the number of 3-stars for node 3 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 4, it has neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}. Therefore, the number of 3-stars for node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 5, it has neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The number of 3-stars for node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 6, it has neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}. The number of 3-stars for node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 38 \]

Therefore, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 3, 5)>
