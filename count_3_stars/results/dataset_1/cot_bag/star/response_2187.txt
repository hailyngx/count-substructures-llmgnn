Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: 2 neighbors (7, 9)
Node 1: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 9) => 4 3-stars
Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 9)
Node 4: 1 neighbor (8)
Node 5: 2 neighbors (2, 7)
Node 6: 2 neighbors (2, 9)
Node 7: 2 neighbors (0, 5)
Node 8: 2 neighbors (4, 9)
Node 9: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 8) => 10 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
\[ \text{Total} = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 \]  

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.  

List of unique 3-stars:  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<2, (1, 5, 9)>  
<2, (1, 6, 9)>  
<2, (5, 6, 9)>  
<9, (0, 2, 3)>  
<9, (0, 2, 6)>  
<9, (0, 2, 8)>  
<9, (0, 3, 6)>  
<9, (0, 3, 8)>  
<9, (2, 3, 6)>  
<9, (2, 3, 8)>  
<9, (2, 6, 8)>  
<9, (3, 6, 8)>  
<9, (1, 2, 5)>  
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
