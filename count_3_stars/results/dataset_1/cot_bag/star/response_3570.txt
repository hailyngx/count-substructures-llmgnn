Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 6 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
