Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>.

For node 2, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 8)>.

For node 3, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

For node 4, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

For node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 5)>, <5, (6, 7, 6)>.

For node 6, there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars. However, there are duplicates with the same central node and leaves, so we need to find and list the unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars for node 6 are: <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>.

For node 7, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

For node 8, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.

For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = [4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 4] = [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 5)>, <5, (6, 7, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<6, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
