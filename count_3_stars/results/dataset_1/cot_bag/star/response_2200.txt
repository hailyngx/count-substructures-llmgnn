Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes, we'll first determine each node's degree to see if it has at least three neighbors. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 6

Nodes with degree less than 3 do not form any 3-star. Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 fall into this category. 

For nodes with degree 3 or more, we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each. Here's the breakdown:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [28]. The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 2)>, <9, (8, 3, 7)>
