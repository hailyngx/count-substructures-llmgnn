Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 76 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 76.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [76]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 8, 9)>
