Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  

0: 2, 3, 9  
1: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8  
3: 0, 4, 7  
4: 2, 3, 5, 7  
5: 1, 4  
6: 1, 2, 7  
7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6  
8: 1, 2  
9: 0, 1  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1  
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10  
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10  
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4  
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10  

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 35.  

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>,  
<1, (5, 6, 7)>,  
<2, (0, 6, 7)>,  
<2, (4, 7, 8)>,  
<4, (2, 5, 7)>,  
<7, (1, 2, 6)>.
