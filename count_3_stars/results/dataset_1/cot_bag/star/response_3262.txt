Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the given edges can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 8
- Node 1 is connected to Node 7
- Node 3 is connected to Node 5
- Node 4 is connected to Node 6
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 3, 6, 7
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 0, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to Node 7

Let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 0: Has 1 neighbor (Node 8), so no 3-star.
- Node 1: Has 1 neighbor (Node 7), so no 3-star.
- Node 3: Has 1 neighbor (Node 5), so no 3-star.
- Node 4: Has 1 neighbor (Node 6), so no 3-star.
- Node 5: Has 3 neighbors (Nodes 3, 6, 7). There is 1 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 6: Has 3 neighbors (Nodes 4, 5, 8). There is 1 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 8)>.
- Node 7: Has 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5, 8, 9). There are 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
- Node 8: Has 3 neighbors (Nodes 0, 6, 7). There is 1 3-star: <8, (0, 6, 7)>.
- Node 9: Has 1 neighbor (Node 7), so no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [10].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>.
