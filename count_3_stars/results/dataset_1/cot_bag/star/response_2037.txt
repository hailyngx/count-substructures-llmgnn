Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars: <0, (3, 5)> and <0, (5, 3)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, and <2, (7, 4, 5)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, and <4, (7, 2, 5)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, and <5, (4, 2, 7)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 2, 5)>, and <7, (5, 2, 4)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 2 3-stars: <8, (3, 7, 9)> and <8, (7, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2] = 16.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
