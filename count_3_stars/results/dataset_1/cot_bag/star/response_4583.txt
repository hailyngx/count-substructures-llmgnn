Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 3 nodes that have at least 3 neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, and 3. 

For node 0:
- Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 0 as the center. 
- These 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, and <0, (2, 4, 7)>. 

For node 2:
- Since node 2 has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 2 as the center. 
- These 3-stars are: <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, and <2, (0, 9, 6)>. 

For node 3:
- Since node 3 has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 3 as the center. 
- This 3-star is: <3, (0, 1, 9)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. 
The unique 3-stars found inside <> are: <<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 9, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>>.
