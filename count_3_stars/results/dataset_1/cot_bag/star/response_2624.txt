Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 5, 7, and 8 (total: 4 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 3, and 6 (total: 3 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors 2, 4, 6, and 8 (total: 4 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 8, and 9 (total: 3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (total: 6 neighbors)

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
