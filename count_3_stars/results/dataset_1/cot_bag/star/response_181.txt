Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are node 0, node 2, node 3, node 4, node 6, node 7, and node 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 9, 4)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 0)>
