Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)> (12 unique 3-stars)

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)> (2 unique 3-stars)

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)> (2 unique 3-stars)

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)> (8 unique 3-stars)

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 3)>, <9, (2, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)> (4 unique 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].
