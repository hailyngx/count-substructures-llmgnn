Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 0, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 5)>
