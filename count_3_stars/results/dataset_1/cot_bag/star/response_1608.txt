Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by calculating the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors. Here's the breakdown for each node:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 6 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (8, 9, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 3)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
