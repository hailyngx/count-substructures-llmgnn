Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 6, 9.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- There are no 3-stars formed with node 1.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 9.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = \text{28} \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4, 5>
<0, 1, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 7, 9>
<3, 2, 6, 7>
<3, 5, 6, 9>
