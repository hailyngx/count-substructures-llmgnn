Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, and 8.

For node 0, we have 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 8. So, we can form one 3-star with node 0: <0, (2, 3, 8)>.

For node 3, we have 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 5. So, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 3. Possible 3-stars are: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (8, 4, 7)>.

For node 4, we have 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8. So, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 4. Possible 3-stars are: <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>.

For node 8, we have 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9. So, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 8. Possible 3-stars are: <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].
