Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node with three or more neighbors.

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

2. Node 1: Node 1 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

3. Node 2: Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

4. Node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

5. Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

6. Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.

7. Node 6: Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

8. Node 7: Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.

9. Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.

10. Node 9: Node 9 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6), so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 47.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [47].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (8, 9, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>.
