Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 6 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 4 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [36]

Listing the unique 3-stars: 
<0, 4, 5, 7>
<3, 2, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8, 4>
