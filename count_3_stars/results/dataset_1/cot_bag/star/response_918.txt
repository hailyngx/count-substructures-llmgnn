Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Connecting the edges to the nodes, we have the following graph:
```
0 --- 5
|     |
4 --- 1 --- 6 --- 9
|     |     |     |
7 --- 8 --- 2     |
      |     |     |
      3 --- 7     |
            |     |
            8 --- 6
```

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 1, there are 4 neighbors (4, 6, 8, 9).
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>

2. For node 2, there are 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 8).
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>

3. For node 4, there are 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7).
   Number of 3-stars = 1
   <4, (1, 5, 7)>

4. For node 6, there are 4 neighbors (1, 2, 8, 9).
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>

5. For node 8, there are 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 9).
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>,
   <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 23.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>,
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>,
<4, (1, 5, 7)>,
<6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>,
<8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>,
<8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>
