Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 0, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
