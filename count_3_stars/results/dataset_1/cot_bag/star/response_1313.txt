Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6

Based on the above information, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
