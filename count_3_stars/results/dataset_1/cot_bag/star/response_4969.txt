Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. We'll apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each such node.

Looking at the given information:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, and 9
  - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 6
  - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 6
  - There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 9, and 5
  - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 9, 5)>
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9
  - There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 17

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (2, 9, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.
