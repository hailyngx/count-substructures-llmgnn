Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0: {3, 6}
- 1: {9}
- 2: {3, 4, 8}
- 3: {0, 2, 9}
- 4: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- 5: {7, 8}
- 6: {0, 4, 7}
- 7: {4, 5, 6}
- 8: {2, 5}
- 9: {1, 3, 4}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 4, 8}, so one 3-star <2, (3, 4, 8)>.
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 6, 7}, so one 3-star <4, (2, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 8)> and <4, (2, 6, 7)>.
