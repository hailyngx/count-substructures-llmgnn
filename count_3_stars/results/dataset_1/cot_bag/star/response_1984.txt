Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 9
- Node 6 is not connected to any other node
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms no 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms no 3-star
- Node 4 forms no 3-star
- Node 5 forms no 3-star
- Node 6 forms no 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms 3 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 0) + 0 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 0 (from node 3) + 0 (from node 4) + 0 (from node 5) + 0 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 3 (from node 9) = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 6, which can be represented as:
[6]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>
