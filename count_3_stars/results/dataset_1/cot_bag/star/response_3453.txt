Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 13\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
