Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 50

So, the answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (7, 5, 2)>
