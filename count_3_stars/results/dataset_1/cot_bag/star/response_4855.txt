Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will analyze each node to determine the total number of 3-stars formed and list the unique 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (6, 9). No 3-star is formed from this node.
   
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors (2, 4). No 3-star is formed from this node.
   
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 8). We have ingroup{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>.
   
4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor (4). No 3-star is formed from this node.
   
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6). We have ingroup{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>.
   
6. Node 5 has 1 neighbor (7). No 3-star is formed from this node.
   
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9). We have ingroup{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 9, 7)>, <6, (4, 9, 7)>.
   
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 9). We have ingroup{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>.
   
9. Node 8 has 1 neighbor (2). No 3-star is formed from this node.
   
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7). We have ingroup{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.

Combining all unique 3-stars, we have: 
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \]
Therefore, there are 16 3-stars in the given graph.
