Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8

Now, calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star
- No 3-star is formed by nodes 5, 8, and 9 as they have less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
