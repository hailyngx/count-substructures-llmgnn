Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 8
Node 3: 0, 5
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 1
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5
Node 9: 1, 4

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([20 + 4 + 1 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 0] = 68\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (1, 0, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 0, 8)>
<5, (4, 0, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
