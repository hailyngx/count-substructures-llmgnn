Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Based on the degrees of the nodes, we have the following number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [0]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [3]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [0]
- Node 9: [0]

Summing these up, we get a total of [7] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (6, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 6, 9)>
