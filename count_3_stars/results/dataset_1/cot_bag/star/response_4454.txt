Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
Node 2 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7 (3 neighbors)
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 7 (3 neighbors)
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 (5 neighbors)
Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 7, 9 (3 neighbors)

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 18  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>,<7, (3, 1, 8)>,<7, (3, 2, 5)>,<7, (3, 2, 8)>,<7, (5, 1, 8)>,<8, (4, 7, 9)>
