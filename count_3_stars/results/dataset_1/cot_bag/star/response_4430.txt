Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 
- Node 1 with neighbors 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2 with neighbors 3, 4, 5
- Node 3 with neighbors 2, 5, 8
- Node 4 with neighbors 1, 2
- Node 5 with neighbors 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8 with neighbors 1, 3, 5
- Node 9 with neighbors 1, 6

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 11 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
