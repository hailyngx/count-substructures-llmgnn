Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 2 and 8.

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (0, 3, 5)>

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 7, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>

In total, there are 1 + 4 = 5 3-stars.
So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
