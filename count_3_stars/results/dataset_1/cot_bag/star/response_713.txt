Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Nodes 7 and 8 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors, so we will focus on them to find the number of 3-stars:

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Applying \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) gives us a total of 10 3-stars

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Applying \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) gives us a total of 20 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( \text{[}10 + 20\text{]} = 30 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<7, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 8, 9)>,
<7, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<7, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 7, 8)>,
<8, (1, 7, 6)>, 
<8, (1, 7, 2)>, 
<8, (7, 1, 6)>, 
<8, (7, 1, 2)>, 
<8, (1, 6, 2)>, 
<8, (7, 6, 2)>, 
<8, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (7, 6, 8)>, 
<8, (7, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (6, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 6, 8)>,
<8, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (7, 6, 8)>, 
<8, (7, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (6, 2, 8)>, 
These 3-stars cover all the possible combinations for nodes 7 and 8.
