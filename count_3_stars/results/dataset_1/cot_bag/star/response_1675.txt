Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 5, 7

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

From the list of nodes, we find that nodes 0, 1, and 4 have 3 or more neighbors. 
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 4) = 15. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
