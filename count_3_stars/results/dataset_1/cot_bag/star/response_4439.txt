Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will examine each node with three or more neighbors.

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1, there is 1 3-star. <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- For Node 2, there are 4 3-stars. <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- For Node 3, there are 10 3-stars. <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 4, 5)>, <3, (7, 4, 8)>, <3, (7, 5, 9)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>, and symmetric variations of these.
- For Node 4, there are 4 3-stars. <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (7, 3, 5)>
- For Node 5, there are 4 3-stars. <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 3, 4)>
- For Node 7, there are 10 3-stars. <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (5, 3, 9)>, <7, (8, 3, 4)>, and symmetric variations of these.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 33.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].
