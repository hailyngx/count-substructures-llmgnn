Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.

Adding these up gives a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 71 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [71], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (7, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 0, 7)>
<4, (7, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 0, 4)>
<7, (4, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 1)>
It is important to note that the example illustrates different permutations of the neighborhood nodes, hence some 3-stars appear more than once.
