Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 8

We calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1 3-star].
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [10 3-stars].
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [10 3-stars].
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [10 3-stars].
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1 3-star].
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms [1 3-star].

Adding these up gives a total of [33 3-stars].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (3, 5, 9)>
