Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [13] \)

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 3, 8)>
- <2, (6, 5, 1)>
- <2, (7, 4, 0)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 2)>
- <6, (3, 8, 2)>
- <6, (5, 2, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 3)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 0, 6)>
- <7, (8, 2, 5)>
- <8, (2, 7, 4)>
