Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed as given. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:

- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 4, 5.
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 5, 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these relevant nodes:

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 7 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
