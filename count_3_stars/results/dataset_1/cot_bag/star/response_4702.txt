Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 1 = 15. 
Therefore, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 6)>
- <3, (5, 4, 8)>
- <3, (5, 4, 6)>
- <3, (5, 8, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 9, 3)>
- <6, (2, 9, 3)>
- <8, (5, 9, 6)>
