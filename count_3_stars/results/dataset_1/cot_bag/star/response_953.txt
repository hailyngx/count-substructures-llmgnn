Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: [1 3-star]
<0, 1, 5>
For node 1: [1 3-star]
<1, 0, 5>
For node 3: [0 3-stars]
For node 5: [1 3-star]
<5, 0, 1>
For node 6: [0 3-stars]
For node 7: [1 3-star]
<7, 5, 9>
For node 8: [0 3-stars]
For node 9: [1 3-star]
<9, 1, 7>

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, 1, 5>, <5, 0, 1>, <7, 5, 9>, <9, 1, 7>
