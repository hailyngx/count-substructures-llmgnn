Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (2, 5, 8) => [\binom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
   - <1, (2, 5, 8)>
  
2. Node 2 has 6 neighbors: (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) => [\binom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars
   - <2, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
  
3. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 6, 9) => [\binom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
   - <5, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 6, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
