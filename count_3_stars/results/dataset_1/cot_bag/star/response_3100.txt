Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

The graph has 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

And 26 edges:
(0, 6), (0, 8)
(1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9)
(2, 9)
(3, 1), (3, 5)
(4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)
(5, 3)
(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9)
(7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9)
(8, 0), (8, 4)
(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Next, let's determine which nodes have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17, which we represent as [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)> 
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
