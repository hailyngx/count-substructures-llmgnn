Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we can represent the given graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0: (1, 3)
- 1: (0, 5, 9)
- 2: (9)
- 3: (0, 9)
- 4: (5)
- 5: (1, 4, 6, 8)
- 6: (5)
- 8: (5)
- 9: (1, 2, 3)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 1, we have 1 3-star: <1, (0, 9, 5)>
- For node 5, we have 2 3-stars: 
  - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <5, (1, 8, 6)>
- For node 9, we have 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
