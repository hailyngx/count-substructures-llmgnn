Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 49 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>
