Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.  

Upon inspecting the graph, we find that nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed at each of these nodes:

1. Node 1 has neighbors 2, 7, and 9. Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 2 has neighbors 1, 6, and 7. Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
3. Node 6 has neighbors 2, 3, 8, and 9. Hence, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 7 has neighbors 0, 1, and 2. Hence, it forms 1 3-star.
5. Node 9 has neighbors 1, 6. Hence, it forms 0 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 7.

So, the final result is  [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
