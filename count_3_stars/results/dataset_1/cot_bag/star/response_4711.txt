Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 2

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 1, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <7, (2, 1, 8)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 2)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 1, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 1)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 0, 9)>
- <8, (7, 1, 2)>
- <8, (7, 1, 9)>
- <8, (7, 2, 1)>
- <8, (7, 2, 9)>
- <8, (9, 3, 4)>
- <8, (9, 4, 0)>
