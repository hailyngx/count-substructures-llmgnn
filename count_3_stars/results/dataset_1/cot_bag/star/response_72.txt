Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes with the following neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <2, (0, 4, 8)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, 
  <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>

Adding all the 3-stars together, we have a total of [23] 3-stars.
