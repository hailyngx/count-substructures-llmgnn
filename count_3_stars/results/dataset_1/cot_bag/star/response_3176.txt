Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 7), forming [1] 3-star(s).
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (0, 5, 7), forming [1] 3-star(s).
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (2, 8, 9), forming [1] 3-star(s).
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 7), forming [1] 3-star(s).
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2, 8, 9), forming [1] 3-star(s).
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 5, 9), forming [1] 3-star(s).
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (4, 6, 9), forming [1] 3-star(s).
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (4, 6, 7, 8), forming [1] 3-star(s).

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars is [7].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
