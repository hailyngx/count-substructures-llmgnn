Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph based on the given edges:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 3 -- 2 -- 6
    |    |    |    |    
    5    4    9    8
```

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up: 
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18

So, there are a total of [18] 3-stars. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <1, (0, 3, 9)>
4. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
5. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
6. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
7. <1, (5, 8, 9)>
8. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
9. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
10. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
11. <8, (2, 4, 6)>
12. <8, (2, 4, 8)>
13. <8, (4, 5, 9)>
14. <9, (1, 3, 5)>
15. <9, (5, 0, 1)>
16. <9, (5, 1, 8)>
17. <9, (5, 3, 6)>
18. <9, (5, 8, 0)>
