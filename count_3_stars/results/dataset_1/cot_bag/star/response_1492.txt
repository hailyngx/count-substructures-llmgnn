Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors
- Node 3: has 1 neighbor
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 6 neighbors
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors
- Node 8: has 1 neighbor
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4 and Node 9, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each -> 8 3-stars
- For Node 6, there are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
- For Node 7, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Total 3-stars: 8 + 20 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29] and the unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (5, 7, 6)>, 
<4, (7, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<9, (0, 6, 2)>, 
<9, (2, 0, 6)>, 
<9, (2, 6, 0)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 9, 1)>, 
<6, (1, 0, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 9, 0)>, 
<6, (9, 0, 1)>, 
<6, (9, 1, 0)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
