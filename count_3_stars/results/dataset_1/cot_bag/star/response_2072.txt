Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with at least 3 neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 3-stars.

Adding these up: 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 10.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 6, 4)>
<2, (3, 9, 4)>
<2, (4, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 3, 5)>
