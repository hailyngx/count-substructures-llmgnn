Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that are connected to three or more other nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 1)>
