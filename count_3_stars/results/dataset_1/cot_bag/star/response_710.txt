Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0 with 5 neighbors and node 5 with 6 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 5:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is 10 (from node 0) + 20 (from node 5) = 30. 

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 1)>
<5, (0, 4, 2)>
<5, (0, 7, 1)>
<5, (0, 7, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 2)>
<5, (0, 8, 6)>
<5, (0, 8, 7)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
