Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7, we get a total of 5 3-stars: <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 9, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
