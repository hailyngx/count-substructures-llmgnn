Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 1

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 47
