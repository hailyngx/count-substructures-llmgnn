Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing them up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (6, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
