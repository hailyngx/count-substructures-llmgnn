Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: node 2, node 4, node 8, and node 1. 
Now, letâ€™s calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>

- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 7)>, <4, (2, 8, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>

- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  <1, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 13.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 7)>, <4, (2, 8, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, and <1, (4, 7, 9)>.
