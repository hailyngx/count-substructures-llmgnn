Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the possible 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 1, 4)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 1, 2, 7)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 4, 5, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 19

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
