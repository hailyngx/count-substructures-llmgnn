Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \). 

Therefore, the final answer is \[13\] and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>
