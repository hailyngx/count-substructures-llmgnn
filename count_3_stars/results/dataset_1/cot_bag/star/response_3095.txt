Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will analyze each node that has three or more neighbors. 

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5) and can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 7) and can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 9) and can form a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
