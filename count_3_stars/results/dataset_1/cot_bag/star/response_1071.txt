Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 5 ,9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Therefore, we have:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (6, 4, 7)>, <2, (7, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>
