Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's evaluate the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 1 has 5 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7, 8) => [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 8) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 0) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (5, 7) => No 3-star can be formed
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 9) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (0, 1) => No 3-star can be formed
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 9) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8) => [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 27
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, （3, 7, 8）>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (7, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
