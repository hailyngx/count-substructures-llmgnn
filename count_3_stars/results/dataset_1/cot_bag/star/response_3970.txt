Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the graph to identify which nodes have at least three neighbors:
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 7, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 7, 8)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3)

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- inom{6}{3} = 20 for node 2
- inom{5}{3} = 10 for node 3
- inom{4}{3} = 4 for node 4
- inom{5}{3} = 10 for node 7
- inom{4}{3} = 4 for node 9

Summing these up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph can be represented as [48]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
