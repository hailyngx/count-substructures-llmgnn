Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 9), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (6, 7, 9), forming 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 4)>, <2, (6, 9, 4)>, <2, (7, 9, 4)>.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 7), forming 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 9), forming 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7), forming 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
