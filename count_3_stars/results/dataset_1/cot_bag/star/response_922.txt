Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as follows:

```
0 --- 4
|\     \
| \     \
|  5 --- 6
| /     /
|/     /
8 --- 9

1 --- 4
|     |
6 --- 2 --- 7
|
3
```

From the given edges, we can see that node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
	Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
	All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 = 8 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
