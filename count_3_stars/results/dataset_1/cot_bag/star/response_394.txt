Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2}

Now, we will check each node to see if they can form any 3-stars:

Node 0: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 1: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 2: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <2, (3, 7, 9)>
Node 3: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 4: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 5: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 7: Has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>
Node 8: Has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <8, (3, 5, 7)>
Node 9: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1] = 6

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
