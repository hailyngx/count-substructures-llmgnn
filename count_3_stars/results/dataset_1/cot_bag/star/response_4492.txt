Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighboring nodes are listed below:

Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 5
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 2, 5
Node 4: 2, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
Node 6: 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 7

Now let's determine the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 7, 8>
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 8>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
