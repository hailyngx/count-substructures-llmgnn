Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {8}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {3}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 4)>.
