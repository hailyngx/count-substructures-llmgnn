Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 19 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
