Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we will first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 8)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (2, 9)

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so we only consider these three nodes. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 10 = 15. 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 2, 1)>
- <4, (1, 3, 2)>
- <4, (3, 7, 2)>
