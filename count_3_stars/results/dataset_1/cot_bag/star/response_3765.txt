Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (5 and 7), so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (4), so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 2:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (5 and 7), so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, and 8), so it forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 8)>.

Node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, and 6), so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars:
<5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>.

Node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (5 and 8), so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, and 9), so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 9)>.

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, and 9), so it forms 1 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 9)>.

Node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (7 and 8), so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7, and they are:
<4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.

Putting this final number inside brackets [] gives us: [7].
