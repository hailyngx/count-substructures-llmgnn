Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges. Here is the visualization of the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <0, (4, 8, 9)>

For Node 1: Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <1, (0, 5, 1)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 1)>
  - <1, (5, 6, 1)>

For Node 4: Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 3, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 4)>
  - <4, (0, 9, 4)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 4)>
  - <4, (3, 9, 4)>
  - <4, (7, 9, 4)>
  - <4, (7, 9, 4)>

For Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed with this node.

For Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <7, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <7, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <7, (2, 9, 7)>
  - <7, (4, 9, 7)>

For Node 9: Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <9, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <9, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <9, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <9, (0, 3, 9)>
  - <9, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <9, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <9, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <9, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <9, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <9, (4, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].
