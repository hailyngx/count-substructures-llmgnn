Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 11. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
