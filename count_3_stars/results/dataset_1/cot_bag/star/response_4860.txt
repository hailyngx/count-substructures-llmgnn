Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Next, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes that have three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
3. Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
6. Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars from all nodes with three or more neighbors gives a total of 12 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 9)>
<0, (5, 4, 1)>
<(5, 0, 2), 7>
<(5, 0, 2), 4>
<(5, 0, 2), 7>
<(5, 0, 2), 4>
<(4, 1, 9), 5>
<(4, 1, 9), 5>
<(4, 1, 9), 5>
<(4, 1, 9), 5>
