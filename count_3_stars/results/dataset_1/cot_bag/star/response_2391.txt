Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: (0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8). So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (4, 6, 7, 8, 9). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 5, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 10 + 4] = [34] \), indicating 34 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>.
