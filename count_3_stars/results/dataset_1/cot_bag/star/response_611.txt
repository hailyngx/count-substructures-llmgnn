Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 4, and node 5.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 = 28

Thus, there are 28 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
