Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 2, node 4, and node 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars formed with node 2 = 1
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars formed with node 4 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 3-stars formed with node 6 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 4)>
<6, (8, 4, 7)>
<6, (8, 7, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 2)>
<6, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 9, 4)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 2, 9)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
