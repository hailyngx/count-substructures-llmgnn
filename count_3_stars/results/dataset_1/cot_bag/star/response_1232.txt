Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 7
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars 
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars 
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 1 + 1] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
