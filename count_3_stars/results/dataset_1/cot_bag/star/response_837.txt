Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
