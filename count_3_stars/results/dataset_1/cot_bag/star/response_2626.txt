Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4 is connected to node 0
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 8 and nodes 1, 6, 9.
Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, 8 and nodes 0, 9, 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 9, 5)>
