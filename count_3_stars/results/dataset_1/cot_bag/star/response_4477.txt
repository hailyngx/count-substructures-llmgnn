Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To start, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 72 \)

Therefore, there are 72 total 3-stars in this graph, which can be represented as:

\[ [72] \]

And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
