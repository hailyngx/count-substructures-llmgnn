Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the graph are as follows:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Edges: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 9), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)

We'll now determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has neighbors {2, 3}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as center: [0]
  
2. Node 2 has neighbors {1, 3, 6}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as center: [1]
    - Unique 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>

3. Node 3 has neighbors {1, 2}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as center: [0]

4. Node 4 has neighbors {5, 9}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 4 as center: [0]

5. Node 5 has neighbors {4, 9}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as center: [0]

6. Node 6 has neighbors {2, 7}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as center: [0]

7. Node 7 has neighbors {6, 9}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as center: [0]

8. Node 9 has neighbors {4, 5, 7}.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 9 as center: [1]
    - Unique 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Combining the total number of 3-stars for each node, we have a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
