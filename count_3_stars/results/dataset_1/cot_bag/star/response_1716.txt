Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the degree of the node.

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars 

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
