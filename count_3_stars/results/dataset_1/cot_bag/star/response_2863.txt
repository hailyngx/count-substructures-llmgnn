Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we'll construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1 contributes 1 three-star.
Node 2 contributes 3 three-stars.
Node 5 contributes 3 three-stars.
Node 7 contributes 3 three-stars.

Total 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 4, 1)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 1, 5)>
