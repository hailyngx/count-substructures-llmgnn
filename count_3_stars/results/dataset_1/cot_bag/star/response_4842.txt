Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

The degrees of the nodes are:
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 5
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 2
Node 10: 0

Since node 5 has 5 neighbors, it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars. The 3-stars involving node 5 are:
<5, (1, 2, 9)> 
<5, (1, 6, 9)> 
<5, (1, 6, 7)> 
<5, (2, 1, 9)> 
<5, (2, 6, 7)> 
<5, (3, 1, 9)> 
<5, (3, 6, 7)> 
<5, (6, 1, 7)> 
<5, (6, 3, 7)> 
<5, (7, 1, 6)> 

Summing up the total number of 3-stars with the calculation above, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
