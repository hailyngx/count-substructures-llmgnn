Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Node 0, 3, 6, and 7 have 4 neighbors each, so we can form 4 3-stars with each of them.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with it.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars, we have:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{1}{3} = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 16 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
