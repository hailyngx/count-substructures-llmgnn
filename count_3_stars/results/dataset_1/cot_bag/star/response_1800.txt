Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For Node 0:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 5)>

For Node 1:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 1 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>

For Node 2:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 2 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <2, (6, 8, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 5 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 9)>

For Node 6:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 6 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>

For Node 9:
- Total number of 3-stars with Node 9 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 15.
