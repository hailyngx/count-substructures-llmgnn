Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and the given edges:
```
    0 --- 4
    |     | \
    |     |  6
    |     | /
    7 --- 1 --- 8
         | \
         5  2
            |
            9
```

Next, let's list the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-star configurations are: 
<1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>
