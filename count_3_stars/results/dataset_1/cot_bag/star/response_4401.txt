Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 3
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

So the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
