Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8),
(1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8),
(2, 5), (2, 9),
(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9),
(4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8),
(5, 2), (5, 3),
(6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 8),
(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8),
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9),
(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 8)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 7: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 3: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

<3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 7: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

<7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars:

10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 3) + 10 (from node 7) = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
