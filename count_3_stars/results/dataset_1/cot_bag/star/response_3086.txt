Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Number of 3-stars formed with each node:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8
There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)>

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 1: <1, (0, 6, 7)>

3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 2: <2, (4, 7, 9)>

4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
Node 3 cannot form a 3-star.

5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3
Node 4 cannot form a 3-star.

6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 8
There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 5: <5, (6, 7, 8)>

7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5
Node 6 cannot form a 3-star.

8. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 7: <7, (1, 2, 5)>

9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 8: <8, (0, 5, 9)>

10. Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2, 8
Node 9 cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [6]
