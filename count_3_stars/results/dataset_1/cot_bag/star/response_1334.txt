Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
