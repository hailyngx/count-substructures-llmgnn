Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.

To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. We can then count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7).
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 6).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 6).

For nodes with 3 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars can be calculated as:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

As node 9 has only 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
