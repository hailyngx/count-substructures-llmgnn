Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's first determine the nodes with exactly three neighbors to identify the 3-star structures.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 7.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.

So, we indicate this as [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>.
