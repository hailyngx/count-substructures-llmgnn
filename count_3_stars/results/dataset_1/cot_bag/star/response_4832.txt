Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Node 1 has 8 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 8 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 9)> 
<1, (4, 6, 9)> 
<1, (5, 7, 9)> 
<1, (3, 6, 7)> 
<1, (4, 5, 7)> 
<1, (3, 5, 7)> 
<1, (4, 5, 6)> 
<1, (3, 4, 9)> 
<1, (3, 4, 7)> 
<1, (3, 5, 6)> 
<5, (1, 7, 9)> 
<5, (2, 8, 9)> 
<5, (1, 3, 7)> 
<5, (1, 2, 3)> 
<5, (1, 2, 8)> 
<5, (1, 3, 8)> 
<7, (0, 4, 6)> 
<7, (0, 1, 6)>

<7, (4, 5, 6)> 
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
