Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the provided edges:

```
    0 -- 6          7 -- 8
   / \     \        |  /
  9   2     9      5  2
      |     |      |  |
      1     7      4  9
                 /  
                5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8

Now, we apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [7] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 9, -)>
- <5, (4, 7, -)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, -)>
- <7, (2, 8, -)>
- <7, (5, 8, -)>
