Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 9: 2, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 4: Not enough neighbors
- Node 6: Not enough neighbors
- Node 7: Not enough neighbors
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
