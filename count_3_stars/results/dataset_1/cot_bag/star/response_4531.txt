Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges based on the given edge list:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(0, 2), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 5), 
(4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9), 
(6, 4), (6, 8), 
(7, 1), (7, 2), 
(8, 6), 
(9, 4), (9, 5)
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 7)
- Total 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>,
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 5)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 9)
- Total 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 4] = 14.
