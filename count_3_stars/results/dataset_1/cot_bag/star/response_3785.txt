Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's analyze each node:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

We can see that nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Now, we sum up these numbers to find the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 22, which we represent as [22]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>
