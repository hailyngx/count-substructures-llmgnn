Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars with. Then we'll count the number of 3-stars for each eligible node.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- For node 0: 1 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: 1 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 8, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 8, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
