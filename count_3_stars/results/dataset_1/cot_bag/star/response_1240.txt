Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center. 
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center. 
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 46 \) 3-stars. 

So the final answer is [46].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
