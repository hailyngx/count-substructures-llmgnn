Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes with four or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = inom{6}{3} = 20
3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 9, 0)>
<0, (2, 0, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 0)>
<0, (3, 0, 6)>
<0, (6, 0, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 0)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 9, 0)>
<0, (7, 0, 6)>
<0, (7, 2, 4)>
<0, (7, 4, 7)>
<0, (7, 6, 0)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<0, (9, 0, 1)>
<0, (9, 1, 0)>
<0, (9, 6, 0)>
<0, (9, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
3-stars:
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 0, 2)>
<6, (7, 0, 4)>
<6, (7, 0, 6)>
<6, (7, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 9, 0)>
<6, (8, 6, 9)>
<6, (9, 0, 7)>

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
3-stars:
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 0)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 9, 1)>
<7, (2, 0, 7)>
<7, (4, 7, 6)>
<7, (6, 0, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<7, (9, 0, 1)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars we get: [20 + 10 + 10 = 40]
