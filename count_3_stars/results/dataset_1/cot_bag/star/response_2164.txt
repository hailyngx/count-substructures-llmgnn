Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars on each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
