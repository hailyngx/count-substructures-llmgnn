Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

We'll now determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 7, and 8).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, and 9).
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7).
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 7, and 9).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (nodes 5 and 9).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, and 4).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, and 6).

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 9: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 8.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
