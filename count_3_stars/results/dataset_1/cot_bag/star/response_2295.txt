Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, and Node 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 6) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (5, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
