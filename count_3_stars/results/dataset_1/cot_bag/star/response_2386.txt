Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each of these nodes.

Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: neighbors 0, 8
- Node 4: neighbors 6, 8
- Node 6: neighbors 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: neighbors 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: neighbors 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 35 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36].

Unique 3-stars:

<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
