Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes, we'll iterate through each node to determine its neighbors so that we can identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: Neighbors {4} -> No 3-star formed
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6} -> One 3-star counted for node 1
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9} -> One 3-star counted for node 2
Node 3: Neighbors {6} -> No 3-star formed
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9} -> One 3-star counted for node 4
Node 5: Neighbors {6} -> No 3-star formed
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 5} -> One 3-star counted for node 6
Node 7: Neighbors {2} -> No 3-star formed
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4} -> No 3-star formed
Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4} -> No 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Thus, the final answer is: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
