Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18 \).

So, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
