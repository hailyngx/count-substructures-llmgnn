Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll look at each node and determine how many 3-stars can be formed with that node as the center. Then we'll sum up these numbers.

Let's start by analyzing each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 9. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 8. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 0. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 1. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 9. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8. It can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node that can form at least one:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 8, 9>
