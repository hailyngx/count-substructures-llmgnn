Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the unique 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6) 
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 2: has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9) 
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 3: has 2 neighbors 
No 3-stars

- Node 5: has 2 neighbors 
No 3-stars

- Node 6: has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9) 
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<6, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 7: has 2 neighbors 
No 3-stars

- Node 8: has 1 neighbor 
No 3-stars

- Node 9: has 2 neighbors 
No 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So, the final answer is [3].
