Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: 0, 9
Node 2: 0, 3, 9
Node 3: 2, 7
Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7
Node 5: 4, 8
Node 6: 0, 4
Node 7: 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 5
Node 9: 1, 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
    <0, (1, 2, 4)>
    <0, (1, 6, 8)>
    <0, (2, 3, 9)>
    <0, (4, 5, 6)>
    <0, (4, 5, 8)>
    <0, (4, 6, 7)>
    <0, (4, 7, 8)>
    <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    <0, (6, 7, 8)>
    <2, (0, 3, 7)>
    <4, (0, 5, 8)>
    <4, (1, 6, 8)>
    <4, (2, 5, 6)>
    <4, (2, 5, 8)>
    <4, (3, 5, 6)>
