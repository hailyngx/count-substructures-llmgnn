Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) 

Response:
To start, let's list out the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 6
Node 1: 3
Node 3: 1, 4, 6
Node 4: 0, 3, 5
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 0, 3, 7, 8
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 6

We can see that nodes 0, 3, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so they have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4] = [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
