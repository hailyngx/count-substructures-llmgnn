Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
  - 0: {5}
  - 1: {8}
  - 2: {5, 9}
  - 4: {5}
  - 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
  - 6: {7, 8}
  - 7: {5, 6}
  - 8: {1, 6}
  - 9: {2, 5}

Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Forms one 3-star: <2, (5, 9)>.
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms three 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (7, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>.
- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9: Does not form a 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by adding the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node: 1 + 3 = 4. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (7, 9)>, and <5, (2, 4, 9)>.
