Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34 \)

So, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>.
