Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 can form 10 3-stars.
Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 can form 4 3-stars.
Node 9 can form 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 
1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 25

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)> and <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
