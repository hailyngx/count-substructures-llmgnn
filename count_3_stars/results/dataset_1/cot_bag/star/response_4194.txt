Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8.

For node 0: 
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars:
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42.
Putting this number inside brackets gives us [42].
