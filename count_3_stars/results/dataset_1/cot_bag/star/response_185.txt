Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Let's find the 3-stars from the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
