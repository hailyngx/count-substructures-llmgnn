Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

```
    0 -- 2 -- 3
    |    |    |
    6 -- 4 -- 5
          |    
          9
          |
          1
          |
          8
          |
          7
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
