Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they are the potential centers of 3-stars.
From the edge list, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 40 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>.
