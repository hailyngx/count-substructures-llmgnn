Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

To find the total number of 3-stars, we can check each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9) - 1 3-star formed
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6) - 1 3-star formed
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7) - 1 3-star formed
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5) - 1 3-star formed
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8) - 1 3-star formed
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3) - 1 3-star formed
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9) - 1 3-star formed
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7) - 1 3-star formed
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: (9, 1), (9, 7) - No 3-star is formed

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, we have a total of 7 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 1, 6>
<6, 1, 2>
<7, 3, 8>
<8, 0, 5>
<1, 5, 9>
