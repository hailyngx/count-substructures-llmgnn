Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
  0 -- 1 -- 7
  |         |
  3         8 -- 9
  |         |
  5         |
  |         |
  6         4 -- 2
```

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 forms inom{3}{2} = 3 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>  
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 7)>  
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 6)>  
Node 5 forms no 3-star  
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 7)>  
Node 7 forms no 3-star  
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (5, 7, 9)>  

The total number of 3-stars is [3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 6  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
