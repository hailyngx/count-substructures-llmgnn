Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the given structure:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (0, 6, 7)> <2, (3, 6, 7)> <2, (0, 3, 6)> <2, (0, 3, 7)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <3, (2, 6, 7)> <3, (2, 4, 7)> <3, (2, 4, 5)> <3, (6, 4, 5)>

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (3, 8, 9)> <4, (5, 8, 9)> <4, (3, 5, 9)> <4, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 = 12].
