Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Number of ways to choose 3 nodes from 5 neighbors of node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 0: [10]

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- Number of ways to choose 3 nodes from 5 neighbors of node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 1: [10]

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Number of ways to choose 3 nodes from 5 neighbors of node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 5: [10]

Summing up the 3-stars from all nodes: [10 + 10 + 10] = [30]

List of unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [30].
