Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0, there are 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

There are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
