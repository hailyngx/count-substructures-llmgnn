Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 7 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together we get a total of \( 35 + 4 + 10 = 49 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 3, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
