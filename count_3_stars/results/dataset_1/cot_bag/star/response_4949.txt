Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {0, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: ${8 \choose 3} = 56$
- Node 2: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 4: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 5: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- Node 8: ${2 \choose 3} = 0$

Total number of 3-stars = 56 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
