Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Applying the method described earlier, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0: Degree 5
Number of 3-stars = $inom{5}{3} = 10$
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 1: Degree 6
Number of 3-stars = $inom{6}{3} = 20$
<1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 2: Degree 2
No 3-star formed

Node 3: Degree 5
Number of 3-stars = $inom{5}{3} = 10$
<3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 4: Degree 4
No 3-star formed

Node 5: Degree 3
Number of 3-stars = $inom{3}{3} = 1$
<5, (0, 3, 6)>

Node 6: Degree 5
Number of 3-stars = $inom{5}{3} = 10$
<6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 7: Degree 2
No 3-star formed

Node 8: Degree 3
Number of 3-stars = $inom{3}{3} = 1$
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Node 9: Degree 2
No 3-star formed

Adding up all the 3-stars gives: 
\[ [10 + 20 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 52.
