Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>
