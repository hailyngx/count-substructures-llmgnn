Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 0), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 7)}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (4, 0), (4, 8), (4, 6)
  - Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as center: 1
  - 3-star: <4, (0, 8, 6)>
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 8)
  - Number of 3-stars with Node 5 as center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 5)
  - Number of 3-stars with Node 8 as center: 1
  - 3-star: <8, (4, 3, 5)>
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Calculate the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, [] = 3
Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 8, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>
