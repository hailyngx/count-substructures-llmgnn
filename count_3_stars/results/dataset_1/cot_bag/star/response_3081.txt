Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 3

Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
