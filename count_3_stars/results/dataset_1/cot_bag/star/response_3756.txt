Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: has neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9} => forms [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 1: has neighbors {5, 6} => forms [0] 3-stars.
- Node 2: has neighbors {7} => forms [0] 3-stars.
- Node 3: has neighbors {0, 7} => forms [0] 3-stars.
- Node 4: has neighbors {6, 7} => forms [0] 3-stars.
- Node 5: has neighbors {1, 9} => forms [0] 3-stars.
- Node 6: has neighbors {0, 1, 4} => forms [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1] 3-star.
- Node 7: has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4} => forms [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 8: has no neighbors => forms [0] 3-stars.
- Node 9: has neighbors {0, 5} => forms [0] 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars formed in this graph: [4 + 1 + 4] = 9

Therefore, the final answer is: [9]

Unique 3-stars in this graph: <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>
