Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows: 

- Node 0: 2 neighbors (1 neighbor missing)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (1 neighbor missing)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (2 neighbors missing)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
