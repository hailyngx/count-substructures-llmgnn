Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors for better visualization:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are 9 3-stars in this graph.
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 9, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 0)>
