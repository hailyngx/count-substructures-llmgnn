Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( C(3,3) = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( C(6,3) = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( C(5,3) = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( C(5,3) = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( C(3,3) = 1 \)

Total 3-stars: \( [1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1] = 42 \)

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
