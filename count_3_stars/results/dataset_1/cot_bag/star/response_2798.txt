Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to node 6
- Node 1 is connected to node 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to node 4 and 9
- Node 6 is connected to node 0
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 4
- Node 9 is connected to node 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using that node as the center.
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 1)>
