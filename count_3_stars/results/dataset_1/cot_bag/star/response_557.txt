Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

So, the final answer is: [42]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 1)>
<5, (8, 4, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (6, 3, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<7, (9, 3, 6)>
<9, (5, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 3, 4)>
