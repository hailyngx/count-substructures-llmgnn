Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
0: 2, 5, 8, 9
1: 6, 7
2: 0, 4
3: 4, 8
4: 2, 3, 5, 6
5: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
6: 1, 4, 5
7: 1, 5, 9
8: 0, 3, 5
9: 0, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 5: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 7: C(3, 3) = 1

Adding these up, we get a total of [20] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
