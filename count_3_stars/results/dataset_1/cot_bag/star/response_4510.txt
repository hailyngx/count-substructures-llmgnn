Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 9)
(1, 8), (1, 9)
(2, 5), (2, 7)
(3, 0), (3, 6)
(4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9)
(5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7)
(6, 3), (6, 5)
(7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9)
(8, 1), (8, 4)
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 0 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (<1, (8, 9)>)
- Node 2: 0 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: 1 3-star (<4, (5, 8, 9)>)
- Node 5: 3 3-stars (<5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>)
- Node 7: 0 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (<9, (1, 4, 7)>)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
