Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, and 6
- The number of 3-stars with node 2 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 2: <2, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 7
- Node 3 does not form any 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, and 9
- The number of 3-stars with node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 6: <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, and 6
- The number of 3-stars with node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 7: <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 6
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0] = 9.
The unique 3-stars in this graph are: <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>.
