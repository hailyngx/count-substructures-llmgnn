Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph using the provided information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

The nodes 3 and 5 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each. This gives us a total of 8 3-stars so far.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 8. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>.
