Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we will draw the graph with the provided information:  
A graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges:

```
    0 --- 8
     \     \
      \     \
       8 --- 1 -- 7
      /     / \ 
     /     /   \
    6 --- 5     2
             \
              9 --- 3
```

Next, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, there are 24 3-stars in this graph. Represented in the format requested, the 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 7, 2)>
- <1, (6, 5, 8)>
- <1, (6, 5, 7)>
- <1, (6, 5, 2)>
- <1, (8, 5, 6)>
- <1, (8, 5, 7)>
- <1, (8, 5, 2)>
- <1, (8, 6, 5)>
- <1, (8, 7, 5)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 8, 6)>
- <5, (6, 8, 1)>
- <5, (8, 6, 5)>
- <6, (5, 7, 1)>
- <6, (5, 8, 1)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 2)>
- <8, (1, 6, 5)>
- <8, (1, 7, 5)>
