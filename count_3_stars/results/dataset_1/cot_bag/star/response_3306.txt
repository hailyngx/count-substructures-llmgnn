Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>.

So, the final answer is: [38], <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>.
