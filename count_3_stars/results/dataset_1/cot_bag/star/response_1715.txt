Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given information into a visual representation of the graph:

Vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0: 8, 9
- 1: 5, 6
- 2: 5, 6, 7
- 3: 6, 9
- 4: 5, 6
- 5: 1, 2, 4, 7
- 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- 7: 2, 5
- 8: 0, 6
- 9: 0, 3, 6

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, and Node 9 each have 4 neighbors.
- Node 0 and Node 4 each have 2 neighbors.

Now, we can proceed to find the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 6:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \]

Therefore, there are 16 3-stars in this graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>
