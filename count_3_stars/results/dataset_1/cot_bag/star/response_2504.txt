Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Let's determine the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

For each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed. 

1. Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
2. Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
3. Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
4. Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
5. Node 1 has 1 neighbor.

Now, let's consider the remaining nodes and count the number of 3-stars formed:
  
1. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   The 3-stars with node 3 as the center are: <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>
  
2. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   The 3-stars with node 5 as the center are: <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>

7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   The 3-stars with node 7 as the center are: <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 2)>, <7, (3, 9, 5)>, <7, (3, 9, 2)>

8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   The 3-stars with node 9 as the center are: <9, (3, 7, 5)>, <9, (3, 7, 2)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 2)>, <7, (3, 9, 5)>, <7, (3, 9, 2)>, <9, (3, 7, 5)>, <9, (3, 7, 2)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 2)>.
