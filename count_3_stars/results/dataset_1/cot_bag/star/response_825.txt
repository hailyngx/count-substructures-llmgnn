Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: (8)
- Node 2: (4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 3: (9)
- Node 4: (2, 9)
- Node 5: (2)
- Node 6: (2, 9)
- Node 7: (2, 9)
- Node 8: (0)
- Node 9: (3, 4, 6, 7)

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 = 8.

Therefore, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
