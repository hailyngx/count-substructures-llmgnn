Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can create the following graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 4
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to Node 1
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 5, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to Node 0
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 3, 7
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 9
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1, 6
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 and Node 3 each have 3 neighbors, so we can form 2 3-stars for each of them.
Node 6 and Node 7 each have 4 neighbors, so we can form 4 3-stars for each of them.

Total number of 3-stars: [2 + 2 + 4 + 4] = [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
