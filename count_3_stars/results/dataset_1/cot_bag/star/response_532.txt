Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have \( \geq 3 \) neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, and 5. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
  The unique 3-stars with node 2 as the center are <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, and 6. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center are <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, and 9. Hence, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  The unique 3-star with node 4 as the center is <4, (2, 6, 9)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, and 7. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center are <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 6)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, and 7. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center are <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 6, 7)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 17 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
