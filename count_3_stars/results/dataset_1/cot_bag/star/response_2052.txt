Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (8, 9)>
- Node 5: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (0, 4)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <4, (8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4)>, <9, (4, 6)>
