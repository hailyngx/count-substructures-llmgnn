Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.

The neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 1: {5, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {1, 2}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {3}
- Node 10: {}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node.

For Node 1: 
- Number of neighbors = 2 (less than 3)
- No 3-stars formed.

For Node 2:
- Number of neighbors = 3
- 1 3-star is formed.

For Node 3:
- Number of neighbors = 4
- 1 3-star is formed.

For Node 4:
- Number of neighbors = 2 (less than 3)
- No 3-stars formed.

For Node 5:
- Number of neighbors = 4
- 1 3-star is formed.

For Node 6:
- Number of neighbors = 3
- 1 3-star is formed.

For Node 7:
- Number of neighbors = 2 (less than 3)
- No 3-stars formed.

For Node 8:
- Number of neighbors = 3
- 1 3-star is formed.

For Node 9:
- Number of neighbors = 1 (less than 3)
- No 3-stars formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, 4, 8>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
