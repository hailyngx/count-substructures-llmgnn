Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 4] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 2)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
<8, (5, 3, 6)>
<8, (5, 0, 1)>
<8, (5, 0, 2)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
