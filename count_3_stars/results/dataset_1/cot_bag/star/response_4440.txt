Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), 
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 4), 
(7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Total 3-stars for node 2 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
