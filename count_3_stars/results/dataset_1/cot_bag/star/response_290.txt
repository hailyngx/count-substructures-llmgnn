Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 6

We see that nodes 4 and 7 both have more than 3 neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them. 

For node 4:
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars, so the total number of 3-stars is [6].
