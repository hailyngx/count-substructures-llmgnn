Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9} based on the given edges.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars using the formula explained above:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 6. So, there are 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 9. So, there is 1 3-star.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star.
7. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 6. So, there is 1 3-star.
8. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 5. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 20.

Therefore, there are 20 3-stars in this graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 7], [1, 3, 9], [1, 4, 5], [1, 4, 9], [3, 0, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 1, 9], [3, 2, 9], [4, 1, 5], [4, 1, 9], [5, 4, 6], [5, 4, 7], [5, 4, 9], [5, 6, 7], [5, 6, 9], [5, 7, 9], [6, 0, 5], [7, 1, 5], [9, 1, 5]>
