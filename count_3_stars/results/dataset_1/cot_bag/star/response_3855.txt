Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we need to first determine which nodes have at least 3 neighbors, as only these nodes can form 3-stars.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Adding these up:
1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<2, (8, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 0, 6)>
<3, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 2, 8)>
<3, (8, 0, 9)>
<3, (8, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 1, 3)>
