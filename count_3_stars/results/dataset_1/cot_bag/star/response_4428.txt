Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph and identify the 3-stars:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 24 edges as specified

From the edge list, we can determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 7}

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- For Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- For Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>
