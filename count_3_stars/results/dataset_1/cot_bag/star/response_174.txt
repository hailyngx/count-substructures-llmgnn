Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (7, 0), (7, 4), (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1)

Now, let's analyze the nodes that could form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1: 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2: 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: 3 has 2 neighbors (2, 5), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4: 4 has 2 neighbors (6, 7), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5: 5 has 2 neighbors (0, 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6: 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: 7 has 2 neighbors (0, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8: 8 has 1 neighbor (1), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9: 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 1), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 2, 9)>, <1, (8, 6, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>
