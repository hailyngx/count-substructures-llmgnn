Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [13] \). 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
