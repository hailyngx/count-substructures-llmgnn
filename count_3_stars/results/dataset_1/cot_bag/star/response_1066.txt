Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are some nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9  
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4  
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 9  
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up, we get a total of 13 3-stars, which we'll represent as [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)> 

So, the final answer is: [13] <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>.
