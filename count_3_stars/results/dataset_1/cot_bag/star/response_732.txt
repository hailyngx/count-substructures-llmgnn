Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars: nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 32 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars within this graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (7, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
