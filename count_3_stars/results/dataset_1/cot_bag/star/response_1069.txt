Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: neighbors 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: neighbors 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: neighbors 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: neighbors 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 5, 6
- Node 9: neighbors 5, 6

Next, apply the combinatorial calculation formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars formed: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 0 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
