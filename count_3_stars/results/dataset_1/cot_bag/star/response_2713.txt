Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph:

```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
(1, 5) (1, 7) 
(2, 4) 
(3, 5) (3, 9) 
(4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) 
(5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) 
(6, 9) 
(7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
(8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) 
(9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8)
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (7, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (8, 0) - 4 neighbors
Node 4: (0, 4), (2, 4), (4, 5), (4, 0), (5, 4) - 5 neighbors
Node 5: (0, 5), (1, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4) - 4 neighbors
Node 7: (0, 7), (1, 7), (7, 0), (7, 8) - 3 neighbors
Node 8: (0, 8), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 9) - 4 neighbors
Node 9: (3, 9), (6, 9), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 8) - 5 neighbors

Now, applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up:
\( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 33 \)

So, there are 33 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them now:
