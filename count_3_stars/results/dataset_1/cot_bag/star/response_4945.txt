Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node that meets this criterion. 

Let's go through the nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 8
    - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
    - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
        - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
        - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
        - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
        - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
        - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
        - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
        - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
        - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
        - <6, (4, 5, 7)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9
    - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <7, (0, 3, 5)>
        - <7, (0, 3, 9)>
        - <7, (0, 5, 9)>
        - <7, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 6
    - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars:
        - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
        - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
        - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
        - <9, (1, 4, 7)>
        - <9, (1, 4, 6)>
        - <9, (1, 7, 6)>
        - <9, (3, 4, 7)>
        - <9, (3, 4, 6)>
        - <9, (3, 7, 6)>
        - <9, (4, 7, 6)>

Adding these up, we get a total of [1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = [25] 3-stars in the graph.
