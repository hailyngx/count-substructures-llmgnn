Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 4.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Thus, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (6, 5, 7)>, <1, (6, 2, 5)>, <1, (7, 4, 5)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 9, and 9.
- Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- Thus, there are 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 1] = [11].
