Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 35 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 66

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
