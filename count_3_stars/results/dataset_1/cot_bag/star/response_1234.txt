Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

We will only consider the nodes that have three or more neighbors since they are the only ones that can form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
