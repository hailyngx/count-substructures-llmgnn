Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 4.

For node 0:
There are 5 nodes connected to node 0, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

For node 1:
There are 4 nodes connected to node 1, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

For node 4:
There are 6 nodes connected to node 4, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

In total, there are \( 10 + 4 + 20 = 34 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
