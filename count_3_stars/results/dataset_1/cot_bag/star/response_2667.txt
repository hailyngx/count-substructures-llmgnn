Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 6, 8, and 3. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 20 + 4] = 34 \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
