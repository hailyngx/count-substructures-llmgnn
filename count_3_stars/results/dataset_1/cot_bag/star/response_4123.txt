Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Next, we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (1, 5, 9) and (6, 4, 5).
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (0, 6, 4) and (5, 2, 3).
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (5, 1, 9) and (7, 0, 6).
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with (4, 5, 8).
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with (5, 1, 9).
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with (2, 0, 6) and (8, 2, 7).
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with (0, 1, 5).
- Node 7 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars.

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get [8]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (6, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 2, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 9)>, <2, (7, 0, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, and <4, (5, 1, 9)>.
