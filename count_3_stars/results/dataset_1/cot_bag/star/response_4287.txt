Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 only has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, which can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, which can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, which can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, which can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, which can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, which can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 8 neighbors, which can form 56 3-stars.
Node 9 only has 2 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 56 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
