Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have at least three neighbors.

From the given edges, the nodes with at least three neighbors are:
- Node 0 with neighbors 2, 3, 5, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 3 with neighbors 0, 5, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 with neighbors 0, 3, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 with neighbors 0, 2, 5, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8 with neighbors 3, 7 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \([4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [10]\).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
