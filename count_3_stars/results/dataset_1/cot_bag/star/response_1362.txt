Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
Edges: 
(0, 7), (0, 8)
(1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8)
(2, 3), (2, 7)
(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)
(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)
(5, 3)
(6, 4), (6, 7)
(7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8)
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7)

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, and 8. 
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as a central node: inom{3}{3} = 1
<1, (4, 7, 8)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 5. 
Number of 3-stars with node 3 as a central node: inom{3}{3} = 1
<3, (2, 4, 5)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1] = [2]
