Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes with their neighbors for better visualization:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 6

Let's now identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, can form 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [\binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + 1 + 1] = [4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 14 \)

So, there are 14 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, 5, 3, 1>, <1, 4, 3, 5>, <1, 7, 5, 3>, <5, 7, 8, 3>, <6, 0, 5, 3>, <6, 8, 7, 5>, <8, 7, 1, 3>, <8, 7, 5, 6>, <5, 6, 9, 0>, <5, 6, 8, 3>, <3, 8, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 6, 5>, <1, 7, 8, 6>, <3, 8, 6, 0> 

Therefore, the final answer is: 
\[ [14] = 14 \]
