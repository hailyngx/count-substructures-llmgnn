Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze the node degrees first:

- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, as we are interested in finding the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 2)>
<7, (5, 8, 8)>
<7, (8, 8, 2)>
<7, (8, 8, 5)>
<7, (8, 8, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 1)>
<7, (2, 8, 7)>
