Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>

For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (6, 7, 9)>,
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 7)>.
