Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors (1, 9), which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors (1, 5), which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors (3, 4), which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 8), which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by each node: 
\( 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 10 \)

So, there are 10 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
