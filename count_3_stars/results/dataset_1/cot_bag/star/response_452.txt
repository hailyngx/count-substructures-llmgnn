Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given information, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 2 3-stars.
- Node 1: It has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2: It has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 4 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 1 3-star.
- Node 8: It has 2 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 13 3-stars.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<1, 0, 8>
<2, 0, 3>
<2, 3, 0>
<3, 2, 4>
<3, 2, 5>
<3, 2, 6>
<3, 2, 7>
<3, 4, 0>
<3, 5, 2>
<3, 6, 2>
<3, 7, 2>
<4, 3, 0>
<5, 2, 3>
<5, 3, 8>
<6, 3, 2>
<7, 2, 3>
<7, 3, 9>
<8, 1, 0>
<8, 1, 5>
