Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

The 3-star graphs can be counted as follows:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 12 3-stars.

So, the final answer is: [12] 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
