Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Node 0 is connected to: {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1 is connected to: {2, 9}
Node 2 is connected to: {0, 1, 5, 9}
Node 3 is connected to: {5, 8, 9}
Node 4 is connected to: {6, 8}
Node 5 is connected to: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 6 is connected to: {0, 4, 7, 8}
Node 7 is connected to: {0, 6}
Node 8 is connected to: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9 is connected to: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

3-stars:
- Node 0 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 2 forms [1] 3-star.
- Node 5 forms [] 3-star.
- Node 8 forms [1] 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
