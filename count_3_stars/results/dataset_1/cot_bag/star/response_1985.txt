Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Now, let's identify which nodes have at least three neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [8] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
