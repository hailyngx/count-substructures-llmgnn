Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We'll start by constructing the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to node 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1: forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: forms 2 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 4)> and <7, (4, 9, 1)>.
- Node 9: forms 2 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 7)> and <9, (8, 7, 4)>.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2] = [7].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (4, 9, 1)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, and <9, (8, 7, 4)>.
