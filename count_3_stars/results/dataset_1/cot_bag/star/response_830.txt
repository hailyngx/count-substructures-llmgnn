Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph described with 10 nodes and 24 edges:

0 -- 1 -- 8 -- 6  
|    |  / |   / |  
5   3 -- 4 -- 7  
| /  
9 -- 2  

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 3 neighbors. Hence, it can form a 3-star with each set of 3 of its neighbors. Since it has 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star formed with node 0: <0, 1, 3, 5>.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 2 also has less than 3 neighbors so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, thus it can form 1 3-star: <3, 0, 2, 8>.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor, less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.
Node 6 and node 7 each have only 1 neighbor, so they cannot form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, hence it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. The unique 3-stars formed by node 8 are: <8, 1, 3, 4>, <8, 1, 3, 7>, <8, 1, 5, 6>, <8, 1, 5, 9>, <8, 3, 4, 6>, <8, 3, 4, 7>, <8, 3, 4, 9>, <8, 3, 6, 7>, <8, 3, 6, 9>, <8, 4, 6, 7>, <8, 4, 6, 9>, <8, 1, 3, 0>, <8, 3, 0, 2>, <8, 4, 0, 5>, <8, 6, 0, 5>, <8, 7, 0, 5>, <8, 9, 0, 5>, <8, 4, 9, 2>, <8, 6, 9, 2>, <8, 7, 9, 2>.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, thus it can also form 1 3-star: <9, 2, 5, 8>.

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated, there are a total of 23 unique 3-stars found in this graph: [23].
