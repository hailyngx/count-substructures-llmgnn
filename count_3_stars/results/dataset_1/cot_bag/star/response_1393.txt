Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 5), (8, 0), (9, 1)

Now, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 (Degree: 5)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4 (Degree: 3)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5 (Degree: 4)

We can see that nodes 0 and 4 have three or more neighbors. Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

For node 0:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
There are 10 possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

For node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

Adding these together:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 = 14

So, there are a total of 14 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 4)>, <0, (2, 1, 3)>, <0, (2, 1, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 5, 4)>, <0, (3, 1, 2)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 4, 1)>, <0, (5, 4, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
