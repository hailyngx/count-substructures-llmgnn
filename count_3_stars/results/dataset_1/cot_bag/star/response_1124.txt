Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 35 3-stars

Therefore, the final answer is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
