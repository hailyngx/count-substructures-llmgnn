Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6), so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0.
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5.
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 29 \]

Therefore, we found 29 3-stars in this graph.

Inside brackets, the total number of 3-stars is given as [29]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
