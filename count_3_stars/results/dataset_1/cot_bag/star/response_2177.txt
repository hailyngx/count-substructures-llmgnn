Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

For node 0:
The number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars formed with node 0: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 2:
The number of 3-stars formed with node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars formed with node 2: <2, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
The number of 3-stars formed with node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars formed with node 6: <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
The number of 3-stars formed with node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars formed with node 7: <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>

For node 8:
The number of 3-stars formed with node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars formed with node 8: <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 9:
The number of 3-stars formed with node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars formed with node 9: <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
