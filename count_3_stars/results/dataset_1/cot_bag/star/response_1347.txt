Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7)
(1, 0), (1, 6)
(2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9)
(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7)
(4, 3)
(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7)
(6, 1)
(7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8)
(8, 7)
(9, 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 6
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 4 has neighbors: 3
Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 3, 7
Node 6 has neighbors: 1
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8
Node 8 has neighbors: 7
Node 9 has neighbors: 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 2: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 3: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 7: C(4, 3) = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 23]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
