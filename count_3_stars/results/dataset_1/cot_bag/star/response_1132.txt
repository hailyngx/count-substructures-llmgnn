Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 2: <2, (0, 1, 5)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 9
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 3: <3, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars with node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Total number of 3-stars formed with node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star with node 8: <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
