Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:  
0: 3, 4, 7, 8  
1: 5, 6  
2: 7  
3: 0, 7  
4: 0, 6, 7, 8  
5: 1, 6  
6: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9  
7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8  
8: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9  
9: 6, 8  

Let's identify the 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 3-stars in total.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Putting this final count inside brackets: [28].
