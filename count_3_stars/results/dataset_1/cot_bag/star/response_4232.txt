Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0, there are three neighbors (7, 9, 9). So the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), which gives us the 3-star <0, 7, 9>.

For node 6, there are five neighbors (3, 4, 5, 7, 7). So the number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). This gives us the following 3-stars: 
<6, 3, 4>, 
<6, 3, 5>, 
<6, 3, 7>, 
<6, 4, 5>, 
<6, 4, 7>, 
<6, 5, 7>, 
<6, 3, 7>, 
<6, 4, 7>, 
<6, 5, 7>, 
<6, 7, 7>.

For node 7, there are 4 neighbors (0, 6, 9, 9). So the number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). This gives us the following 3-stars:
<7, 0, 6>,
<7, 0, 9>,
<7, 6, 9>,
<7, 9, 9>.

For node 9, there are 5 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 8, 7). So the number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). This gives us the following 3-stars: 
<9, 0, 3>, 
<9, 0, 7>, 
<9, 0, 8>, 
<9, 3, 7>, 
<9, 3, 8>, 
<9, 7, 8>, 
<9, 0, 7>, 
<9, 0, 8>, 
<9, 7, 8>, 
<9, 0, 7>.

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we get [1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 25. 
So, the final answer is [25].
