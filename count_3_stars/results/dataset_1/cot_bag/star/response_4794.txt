Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 4)

Now we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>.
Node 4 forms no 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms no 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17.

Thus, the final answer is [17].
