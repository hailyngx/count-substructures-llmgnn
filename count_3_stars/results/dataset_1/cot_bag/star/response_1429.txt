Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

The 10 nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are:
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6)
(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9)
(2, 3)
(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 8)
(4, 1), (4, 6)
(5, 0), (5, 1)
(6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 8)
(8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6)
(9, 1)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 6: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
