Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 5
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\( \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
