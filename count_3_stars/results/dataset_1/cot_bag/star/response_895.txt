Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 1

Next, we identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors for potential 3-stars: nodes 0 and 6.

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has degree 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Total 3-stars involving Node 0: [1]
- Unique 3-star with Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 8)>

For Node 6:
- Node 6 has degree 3, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Total 3-stars involving Node 6: [1]
- Unique 3-star with Node 6: <6, (4, 5, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
