Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:
Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 1: 2, 4, 6
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 0, 1, 3
Node 5: 0, 6, 9
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 6
Node 8: 0, 6, 9
Node 9: 5, 8

Let's find the number of 3-stars for each node:

For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>

For Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
<1, (2, 4, 6)>

For Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
<4, (0, 1, 3)>

For Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
<5, (0, 6, 9)>

For Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>

For Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
<8, (6, 9, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
