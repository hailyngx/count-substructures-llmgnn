Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1 and 4. 

Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 also has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 9, 8), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these together, we have a total of 20 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is: [20]
The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<1, (4, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (6, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
