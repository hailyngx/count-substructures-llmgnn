Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first create the graph using the provided information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 6)
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(2, 5)
(3, 1)
(4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 9)
(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9)
(9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 1: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 2: Does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 3: Does not have 3 neighbors.
Node 4: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 5: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 6: Forms 1 3-star.
Node 9: Forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

Therefore, there are 4 total 3-stars in this graph. 

So the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>.
