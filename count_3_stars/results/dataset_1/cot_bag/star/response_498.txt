Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will examine each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 8), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors (0, 1), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 6 has 1 neighbor (3), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 7 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor (1), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we can form, we get \[ [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [12]. \]

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
