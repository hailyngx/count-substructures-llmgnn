Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 8, 0)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (7, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 9, 2)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (9, 2)
- Node 9 has 7 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 1)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) possible 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 44 3-stars in this graph.

So, the answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 8, 0)>
- <2, (1, 3, 0)>
- <2, (1, 0, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
