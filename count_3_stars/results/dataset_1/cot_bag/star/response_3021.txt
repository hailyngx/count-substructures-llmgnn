Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we'll first list out the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5

Next, we'll identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 2 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3}] = 2 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 21

Thus, the final result is [21].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>
