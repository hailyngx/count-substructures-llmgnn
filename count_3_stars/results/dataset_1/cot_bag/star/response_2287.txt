Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Has 5 neighbors
- Node 1: Has 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Has 6 neighbors
- Node 3: Has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: Has 1 neighbor
- Node 5: Has 3 neighbors
- Node 6: Has 4 neighbors
- Node 7: Has 3 neighbors
- Node 8: Has 5 neighbors
- Node 9: Has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \([10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 20] = 64\)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 5)>, <2, (8, 9, 6)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (7, 8, 0)>, <9, (7, 8, 2)>, <9, (7, 8, 5)>, <9, (7, 8, 6)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (8, 5, 6)>, <9, (8, 6, 0)>, <9, (8, 6, 2)>, <9, (8, 6, 5)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 2)>, <9, (8, 7, 5)>, <9, (8, 7, 6)>
