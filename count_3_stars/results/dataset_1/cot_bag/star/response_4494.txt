Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, let's find the 3-stars it contains:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 9. So, it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, and 9. So, it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 4. Only one 3-star is possible with node 2:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 5. Only one 3-star is possible with node 4:
<4, (0, 2, 5)>

Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 9. As it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors, no 3-stars can be formed with node 5.

Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 7 and 9. As it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors, no 3-stars can be formed with node 6.

Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 8. Only one 3-star is possible with node 7:
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 7. As it doesn't have at least 3 neighbors, no 3-stars can be formed with node 8.

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, and 6. So, it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars:
<9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Putting it all together, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
