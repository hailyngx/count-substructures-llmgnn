Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph described, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 satisfy this condition. 

For node 2:
- It has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 3:
- It has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, and 8.
- The number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 5:
- It has 2 neighbors: 2 and 3.
- Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 5 as the center.

For node 7:
- It has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, and 8.
- The number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 8:
- It has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 9:
- It has 2 neighbors: 2 and 8.
- Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4. 

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we have [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
