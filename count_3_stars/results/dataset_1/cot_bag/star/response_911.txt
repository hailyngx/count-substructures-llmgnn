Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 3)

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node with at least 3 neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it forms.

Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6) -> Total 4 neighbors -> Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8) -> Total 4 neighbors -> Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9) -> Total 4 neighbors -> Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8) -> Total 4 neighbors -> Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5) -> Total 3 neighbors -> Only 1 3-star: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5)

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node:
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
