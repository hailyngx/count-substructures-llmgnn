Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}. This allows for \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars to be formed with node 1.

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 7}. There will be 1 3-star formed with node 2.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6}. This allows for \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4.

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {1, 6, 7, 9}. This allows for \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 8.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 1 + 10 + 10] = 41 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
