Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 
\(4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
