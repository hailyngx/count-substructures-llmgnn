Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 12 nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 26 3-stars in the graph: 

\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = [26] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
