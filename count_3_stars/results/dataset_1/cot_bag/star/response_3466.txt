Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can identify the nodes with their respective neighbors to determine the 3-stars formed.

The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 5

We can now count the number of 3-stars formed for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>

- For Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>

- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  <2, (3, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is 25, so the final answer is [25].
