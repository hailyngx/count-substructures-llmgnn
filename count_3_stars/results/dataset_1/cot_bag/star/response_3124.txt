Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we can count the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars centered at node 0 are: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 6)>

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  The 3-star centered at node 1 is: <1, (4, 6, 7)>

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  The 3-stars centered at node 2 are: <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (8, 0, 6)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  The 3-star centered at node 4 is: <4, (1, 8, 9)>

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars centered at node 6 are: <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 2)>, <6, (0, 8, 5)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 0, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 0, 8)>, <6, (8, 0, 5)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  The 3-stars centered at node 7 are: <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 0, 9)>, <7, (3, 1, 9)>

- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  The 3-stars centered at node 8 are: <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 2)>, <8, (0, 6, 4)>, <8, (0, 6, 5)>, <8, (2, 0, 6)>, <8, (4, 0, 6)>, <8, (5, 0, 6)>, <8, (6, 0, 2)>, <8, (6, 0, 4)>, <8, (6, 0, 5)>, <8, (4, 1, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>, <8, (4, 9, 6)>, <8, (6, 0, 2)>, <8, (6, 0, 4)>, <8, (6, 0, 5)>, <8, (6, 4, 9)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  The 3-stars centered at node 9 are: <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (4, 1, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 1)>, <9, (8, 1, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
