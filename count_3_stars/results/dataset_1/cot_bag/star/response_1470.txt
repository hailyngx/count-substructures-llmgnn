Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. Nodes with less than 3 neighbors cannot form a 3-star.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9. This forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Nodes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9 each have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ [1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3] = [13] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 9, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 9, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>
