Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these together, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>.
