Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see which nodes it is connected to:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>
  
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
  <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, 
  <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
  <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, 
  <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, 
  <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, 
  <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>

- Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

There are 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [38].
