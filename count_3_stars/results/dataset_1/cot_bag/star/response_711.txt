Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node from the given edges, we find:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 6
- Node 7 has degree 6
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 3

We'll list the 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms [1] 3-stars
- Node 2 forms [1] 3-stars
- Node 3 forms [1] 3-stars
- Node 4 forms [1] 3-stars
- Node 5 forms [1] 3-stars
- Node 6 forms [10] 3-stars
- Node 7 forms [10] 3-stars
- Node 8 forms [1] 3-stars

Summing up all the formed 3-stars gives a total of [25]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
