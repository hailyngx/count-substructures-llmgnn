Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 6)
Node 1 (neighbors: 4, 5, 8)
Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 7, 9)
Node 4 (neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7)
Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9)
Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8)
Node 7 (neighbors: 2, 4, 6)
Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 6)
Node 9 (neighbors: 2, 5)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars
Node 1 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
Node 2 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <2, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 4 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>
Node 5 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 6 forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 7 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
Node 8 forms [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars
Node 9 forms [inom{1}{3}] = 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = 21.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)> 

So, the final answer is [21].
