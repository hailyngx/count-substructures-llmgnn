Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors. Let's list the nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 7, 8
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 1: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (not enough neighbors)

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, so there are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list these 3-stars:
- <2, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 2>
- <4, 2, 8>
- <5, 1, 9>
- <7, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, 4, 8>, <3, 7, 2>, <4, 2, 8>, <5, 1, 9>, <7, 3, 8>.
