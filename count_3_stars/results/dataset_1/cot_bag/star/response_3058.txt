Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 0, 6)>
<9, (3, 0, 6)>
