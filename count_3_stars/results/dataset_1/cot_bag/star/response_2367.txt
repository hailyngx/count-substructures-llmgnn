Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  

1. For node 0:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
2. For node 1:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
3. For node 2:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
4. For node 3:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
5. For node 4:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
6. For node 5:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
7. For node 6:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
8. For node 8:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
9. For node 9:  \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars  

Adding all the 3-stars up gives us a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 35 \) unique 3-stars.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 2, 6)>  
<0, (1, 2, 8)>  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<0, (2, 6, 8)>  
<1, (0, 2, 3)>  
<1, (0, 2, 5)>  
<1, (2, 3, 5)>  
<1, (4, 8, 9)>  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (1, 3, 5)>  
<4, (1, 8, 9)>  
<6, (0, 2, 7)>  
<6, (0, 8, 7)>  
<6, (2, 8, 7)>  
<8, (0, 1, 4)>  
<8, (0, 6, 9)>  
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
