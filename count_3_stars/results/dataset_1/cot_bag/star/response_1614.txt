Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, and 6. 

For node 1:
There are 4 neighbors of node 1: nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6. This forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 3:
There are 3 neighbors of node 3: nodes 2, 7, and 9. This forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 3 as the center:
<3, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 6:
There are 3 neighbors of node 6: nodes 0, 1, and 9. This forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6 as the center:
<6, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>
