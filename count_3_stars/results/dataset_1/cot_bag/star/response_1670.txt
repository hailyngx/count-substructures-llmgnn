Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent this graph visually:

```
    0 --- 2     6
    |     |   / | \
    5 --- 1 - 3  7
    |     |   \ |
    8     4     8
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
   Possible 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 8)>

2. Node 1: It has 2 neighbors (5, 8), which is less than 3.

3. Node 2: It has 2 neighbors (0, 6), which is less than 3.

4. Node 3: It has 2 neighbors (5, 6), which is less than 3.

5. Node 4: It has 1 neighbor (8), which is less than 3.

6. Node 5: It has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6, 7), so it can form 10 3-stars.
   Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>,
                    <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>

7. Node 6: It has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 7), so it can form 4 3-stars.
   Possible 3-stars: <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>

8. Node 7: It has 2 neighbors (5, 6), which is less than 3.

9. Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.
   Possible 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 16.

The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, and <8, (0, 1, 4)>.
