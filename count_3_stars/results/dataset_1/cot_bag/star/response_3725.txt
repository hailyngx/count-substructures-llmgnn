Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the visual representation of the graph:

```
       0
       |
       5
      / \
     3 - 1 - 6
       x | x
       | 2 |
       4 - 8
       | x |
       |   |
       9 - 7
```

Now, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (6, 7, 8)>
- <8, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (8, 9, 7)>
