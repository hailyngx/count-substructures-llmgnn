Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the description of the graph, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 6, 8, 9} (Degree: 4)
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 4, 9} (Degree: 3)
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 3} (Degree: 2)
- Node 5: neighbors {8, 9} (Degree: 2)
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7} (Degree: 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 \)   #=> [9]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
