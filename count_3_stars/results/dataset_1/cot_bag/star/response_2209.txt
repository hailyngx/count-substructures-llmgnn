Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors first. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 2, 8

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we can find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) (4 unique 3-stars)
- Node 9: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 13

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 0)>, <2, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 1)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (3, 7, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 3)>, <4, (6, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 1)>.
