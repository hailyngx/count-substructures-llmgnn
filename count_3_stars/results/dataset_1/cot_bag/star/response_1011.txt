Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph is constructed as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.

From this graph, we can identify the 3-stars and count them using the method explained earlier. The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>
