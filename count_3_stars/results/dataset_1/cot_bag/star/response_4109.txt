Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
  - 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
  - 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 7, 9)>
  - 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 4, 8)>
  - 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
  - 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
  - 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 3, 9)>
  - 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors
  - 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1] = [15]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.
