Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
From the given information, we construct the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges. Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph using the method described earlier.

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0, we have \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 9)>.
- For node 3, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>.
- For node 4, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
  - <4, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (1, 3, 8)>.
- For node 7, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
  - <7, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <7, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <7, (2, 5, 6)>
  - <7, (4, 5, 6)>.

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<7, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 6)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 6)>.
