Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph with its nodes and edges visually for better understanding:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (9, 0), (9, 1)

Based on this information, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <1, (6, 7, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>
