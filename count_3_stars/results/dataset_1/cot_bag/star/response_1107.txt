Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 6 and 3, 4, 5. (2)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 7. (1)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 8. (1)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 4 and 0, 4, 6. (2)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 9. (1)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, 9. (1)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, 8. (1)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
