Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 3, and 9.

For node 0:
There are 3 possible 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 3:
There are 4 possible 3-stars: 
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 6)>

For node 9:
There are 4 possible 3-stars:
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Putting them all together, we have a total of 11 3-stars in this graph: [11].
