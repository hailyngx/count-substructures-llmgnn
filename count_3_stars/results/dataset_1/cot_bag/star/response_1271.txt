Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we have the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 8), 
(1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), 
(2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), 
(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), 
(4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), 
(5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), 
(6, 5), 
(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), 
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), 
(9, 1)

The degrees of the nodes are:
Node 0: 1
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 1

Nodes with degree 3 or more are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars based on the degrees of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
