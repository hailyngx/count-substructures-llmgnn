Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}

Let's examine each node to determine its neighbors and find the 3-stars. 

Node 0 has neighbors: {2, 4}, forming one 3-star with nodes {0, 2, 4}.
Node 1 has neighbors: {8}.
Node 2 has neighbors: {0, 7, 9}, forming three 3-stars with nodes {0, 2, 7}, {2, 7, 9}, and {0, 2, 9}.
Node 3 has neighbors: {7}.
Node 4 has neighbors: {0, 8}, forming one 3-star with nodes {0, 4, 8}.
Node 7 has neighbors: {2, 3}, forming one 3-star with nodes {2, 3, 7}.
Node 8 has neighbors: {1, 4}.
Node 9 has neighbors: {2}.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 7>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 4, 8>, <2, 3, 7>

The number of 3-stars in total is [5].
