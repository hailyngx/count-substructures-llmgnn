Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0:  Neighbor nodes: 4

Node 1:  Neighbor nodes: 4, 9

Node 2:  Neighbor nodes: 7

Node 4:  Neighbor nodes: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8

Node 5:  Neighbor nodes: 6, 7, 8

Node 6:  Neighbor nodes: 4, 5, 8

Node 7:  Neighbor nodes: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9

Node 8:  Neighbor nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Node 9:  Neighbor nodes: 1, 7, 8

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars. Let's start:

From the list above, nodes 4, 7, and 8 have at least 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
<4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>

Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
<7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
<8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
