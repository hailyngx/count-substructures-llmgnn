Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 7), (8, 9)]

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 4, 5, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 5, 7
- Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 5, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of 8 3-stars. Thus, the final count is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
