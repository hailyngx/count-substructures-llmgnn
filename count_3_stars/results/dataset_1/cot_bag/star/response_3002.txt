Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph as follows:

- Node 0: has neighbors {4, 6, 7} => can form 1 3-star
- Node 1: has neighbors {6, 8} => can form 1 3-star
- Node 2: has neighbors {6, 9} => can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: has neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8} => can form 4 3-stars
- Node 4: has neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9} => can form 4 3-stars
- Node 5: has neighbors {3, 9} => can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: has neighbors {0, 1, 2} => can form 1 3-star
- Node 7: has neighbors {0, 3, 8} => can form 1 3-star
- Node 8: has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 7, 9} => can form 5 3-stars
- Node 9: has neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8} => can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 8)>, <2, (6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>
