Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

0: 2, 5, 6

1: 3, 5

2: 0, 3, 6, 9

3: 1, 2, 8

5: 0, 1, 7

6: 0, 2, 7

7: 5, 6, 8

8: 3, 7, 9

9: 2, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: No 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 8.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
