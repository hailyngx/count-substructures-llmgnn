Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors as potential centers of 3-stars. These are nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <4, 1, 7>
- <4, 2, 7>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <7, 1, 4>
- <7, 1, 8>
- <7, 2, 4>
- <7, 4, 9>
- <7, 9, 8>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
