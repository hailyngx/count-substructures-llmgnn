Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3)}

For each node with three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7) -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 9) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8) -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 8) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (8, 9) -> no 3-stars
- Node 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have fewer than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with them.

Total 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>
