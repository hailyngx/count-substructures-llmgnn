Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
