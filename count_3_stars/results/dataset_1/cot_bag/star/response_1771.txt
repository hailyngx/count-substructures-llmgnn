Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we can identify the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 9
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 6, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 8

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
\[ \sum_{v \in V} \binom{deg(v)}{3} \]

Calculating this for each node:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
