Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Considering the given details, let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5
- Node 8 is connected to node 1
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 5: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
<5, (4, 7, 9)>

Adding them all up: 4 + 1 = 5.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
