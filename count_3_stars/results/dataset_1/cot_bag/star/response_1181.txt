Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

1. Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (1, 9), so no 3-star can be formed.
2. Node 1: Has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 8), so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. Node 2: Has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8), so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
   <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>
4. Node 3: Has 1 neighbor (6), so no 3-star can be formed.
5. Node 5: Is not connected to any other node, so no 3-star can be formed.
6. Node 6: Has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5, 9), so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
   <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, 
   <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>
7. Node 7: Has 1 neighbor (2), so no 3-star can be formed.
8. Node 8: Has 2 neighbors (1, 2), so no 3-star can be formed.
9. Node 9: Has 2 neighbors (0, 6), so no 3-star can be formed.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
