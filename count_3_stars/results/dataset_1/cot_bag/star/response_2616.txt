Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>.
