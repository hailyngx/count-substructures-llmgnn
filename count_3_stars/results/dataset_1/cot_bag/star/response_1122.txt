Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 17 \). 

Thus, the final answer is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (4, 2, 9)>
- <1, (4, 3, 5)>
- <1, (6, 0, 7)>
- <1, (9, 2, 4)>
- <1, (9, 2, 5)>
- <1, (9, 4, 2)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (1, 0, 6)>
- <2, (1, 0, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
