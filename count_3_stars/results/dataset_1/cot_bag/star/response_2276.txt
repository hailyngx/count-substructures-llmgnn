Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.

Let's find the number of 3-stars in each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [25] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
