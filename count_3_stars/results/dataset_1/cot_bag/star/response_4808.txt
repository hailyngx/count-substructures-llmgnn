Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 4, 7
Node 2: 3, 9
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 5
Node 5: 0, 4
Node 6: 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 6, 7
Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [C(4, 3)] = 4
Node 1: [C(3, 3)] = 1
Node 3: [C(4, 3)] = 4
Node 4: [C(3, 3)] = 1
Node 6: [C(3, 3)] = 1
Node 7: [C(5, 3)] = 10
Node 9: [C(4, 3)] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = [25]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
