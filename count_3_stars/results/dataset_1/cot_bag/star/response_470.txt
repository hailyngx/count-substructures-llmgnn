Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first examine each node's neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes and their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1+1] = 2.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (7, 8, 3)>
