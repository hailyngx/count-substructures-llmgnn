Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 2, 6, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (5, 4, 7)>
- <0, (5, 4, 8)>
- <0, (7, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
