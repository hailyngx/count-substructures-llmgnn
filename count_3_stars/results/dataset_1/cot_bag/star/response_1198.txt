Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 6)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (1, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (2, 6)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6)

Now let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [41] \]

The unique 3-stars formed are: 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>
