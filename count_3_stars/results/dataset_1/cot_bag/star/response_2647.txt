Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 5, 8
Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 5
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 3
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 2, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 8

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 5, 8), 1 3-star (0, 5, 9), 1 3-star (0, 8, 9) => Total: 3
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 5, 8) => Total: 1
- Node 2: 1 3-star (2, 6, 7), 1 3-star (2, 6, 9), 1 3-star (2, 7, 9) => Total: 3
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 1, 7), 1 3-star (8, 1, 9), 1 3-star (8, 7, 9) => Total: 3
- Node 9: 1 3-star (9, 0, 4), 1 3-star (9, 0, 8), 1 3-star (9, 4, 8) => Total: 3

Total number of 3-stars: 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>.
