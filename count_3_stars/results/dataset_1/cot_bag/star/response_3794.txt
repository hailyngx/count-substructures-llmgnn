Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as: 
(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), 
(1, 6), 
(2, 3), (2, 4), 
(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), 
(4, 2), (4, 6), 
(5, 0), (5, 6), 
(6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), 
(7, 3), 
(8, 3), 
(9, 0), (9, 3).

Let's analyze the nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 6
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 3
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 3
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3

Based on the analysis above, the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 3, 6.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations they can form:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so <0, (3, 5, 9)> is the 3-star configuration.
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), so <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)> are the 3-star configurations.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)> are the 3-star configurations.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 4] = 15.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>.
