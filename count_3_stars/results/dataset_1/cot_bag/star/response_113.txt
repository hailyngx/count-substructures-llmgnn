Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 9 3-stars, so the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
