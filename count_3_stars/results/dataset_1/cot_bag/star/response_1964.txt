Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 1: {7}
Node 2: {9}
Node 3: {0, 8}
Node 4: {0}
Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
Node 6: {5, 8, 9}
Node 7: {1, 9}
Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 7}

From the list above, we see that nodes 0, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 5:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 6:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 6)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 11.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.
