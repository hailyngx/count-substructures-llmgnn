Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using the adjacency list:

Node 0 : {6, 9}  
Node 1 : {5}  
Node 2 : {4, 5, 8, 9}  
Node 3 : {7}  
Node 4 : {2, 8}  
Node 5 : {1, 2, 9}  
Node 6 : {0}  
Node 7 : {3}  
Node 8 : {2, 4}  
Node 9 : {0, 2, 5}  

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.  
Node 1: Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.  
Node 2: Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars:  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<2, (5, 8, 9)>  
<2, (4, 5, 8)>  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>  

Node 3: Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.  
Node 4: Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.  
Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:  
<5, (1, 2, 9)>  

Node 6: Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.  
Node 7: Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.  
Node 8: Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.  
Node 9: Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star:  
<9, (0, 2, 5)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, and they are:  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<2, (5, 8, 9)>  
<2, (4, 5, 8)>  
<2, (4, 5, 9)>  
<5, (1, 2, 9)>  
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
