Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up gives a total of 30 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
