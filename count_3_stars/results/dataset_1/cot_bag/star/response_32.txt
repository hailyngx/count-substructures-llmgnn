Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
0 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
|         |      
5 -- 6    7
|         |
1 -- 8 -- 9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 5, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 20 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20.

Listing unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)> 

So, the final result is [20].
