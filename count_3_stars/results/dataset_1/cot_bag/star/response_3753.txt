Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \[ 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 74 \]

So, the number of unique 3-stars is 74. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
