Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 38 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is now given by [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
