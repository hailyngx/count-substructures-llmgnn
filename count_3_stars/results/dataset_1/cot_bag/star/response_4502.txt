Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 1: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 2: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 3: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 4: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 6: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 7: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 8: C(4,3) = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 29
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
