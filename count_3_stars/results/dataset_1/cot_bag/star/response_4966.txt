Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
