Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding all the 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are 33 3-stars in this graph.

<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>
