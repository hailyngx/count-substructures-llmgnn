Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 9.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 9.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 9.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18 \), and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].
