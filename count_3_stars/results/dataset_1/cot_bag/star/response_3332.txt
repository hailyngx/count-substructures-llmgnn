Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we'll apply the combination \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of 3-stars it is part of.

1. Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 9)
   Number of 3-stars for node 2 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>

2. Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6)
   Number of 3-stars for node 3 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <3, (0, 4, 6)>

3. Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9)
   Number of 3-stars for node 4 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <4, (3, 5, 9)>

4. Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8)
   Number of 3-stars for node 6 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <6, (2, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
