Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} 

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8)
(1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5)
(2, 9)
(3, 5), (3, 6)
(4, 1), (4, 7)
(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 9)
(6, 3)
(7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 9)
(8, 0)
(9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: There are 3 neighbors (1, 7, 8) -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 1: There are 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5) -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 3: There are 2 neighbors (5, 6) <no 3-star>
For node 4: There are 2 neighbors (1, 7) <no 3-star>
For node 5: There are 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9) -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 7: There are 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9) -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 9: There are 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7) -> [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>
