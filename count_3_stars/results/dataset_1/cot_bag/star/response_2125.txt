Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
     1 -- 5
     | \  /|
     |  2 |
     | / \|
     4 -- 6
     |    |
     9 -- 3
```

From the given graph, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes.

For node 1:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 2:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 4:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 6:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
