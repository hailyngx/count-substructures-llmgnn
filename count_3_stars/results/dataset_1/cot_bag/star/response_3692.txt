Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will analyze each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
  Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  Unique 3-star configurations: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
  Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  Unique 3-star configurations: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
  Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  Unique 3-star configurations: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.
  Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  Unique 3-star configurations: <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node with three or more neighbors, we get:
\[ [10 + 10 + 20 + 10] = [50] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 50.
