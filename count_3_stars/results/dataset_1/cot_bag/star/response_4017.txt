Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 0: [1 3-star]
Node 2: [1 3-star]
Node 4: [1 3-star]
Node 6: [1 3-star]
Node 8: [1 3-star]

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
