Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Let's find the 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:

- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star with each combination of its neighbors. That's a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>

- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors (3, 6), so it cannot form any 3-star.

- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (5, 6, 9), so it can form 1 3-star with each combination of its neighbors. That's a total of \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star.

<4, (5, 6, 9)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 + 1] = 5\).
