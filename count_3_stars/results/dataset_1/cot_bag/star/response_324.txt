Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each of those nodes. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 6

Calculating 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
