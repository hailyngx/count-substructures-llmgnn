Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
Node 5 is connected to node 6.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 forms 15 3-stars.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 5 3-stars.
Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 15 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 2)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 0, 1)>
<6, (9, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 2)>
<7, (8, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 0, 1)>
<9, (7, 2, 4)>
