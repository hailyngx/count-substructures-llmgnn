Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors -> total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors -> total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors -> total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \). 
So, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 2)>
<5, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<5, (9, 4, 2)>
