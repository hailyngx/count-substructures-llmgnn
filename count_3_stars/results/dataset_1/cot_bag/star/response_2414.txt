Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have 6 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 43 \)

So, there are 43 3-stars in the graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (5, 6, 8)>  

The total number of 3-stars is 43.
