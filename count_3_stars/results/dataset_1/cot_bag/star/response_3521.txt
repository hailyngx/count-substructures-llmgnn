Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 29 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
