Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So the total number of 3-stars is 7. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 0)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 0)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>
