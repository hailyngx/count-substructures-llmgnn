Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors 
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors 
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
