Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 35 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
