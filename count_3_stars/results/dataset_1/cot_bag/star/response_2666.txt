Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (0,8), (0,9), (1,3), (1,7), (1,9), (2,4), (2,7), (3,0), (3,1), (3,8), (4,0), (4,2), (4,6), (4,7), (5,8), (6,0), (6,4), (6,7), (6,8), (7,1), (7,2), (7,4), (7,6), (8,0), (8,3), (8,5), (8,6), (8,9), (9,0), (9,1), (9,8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors
Node 1 has 3 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 4 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 5 neighbors
Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
