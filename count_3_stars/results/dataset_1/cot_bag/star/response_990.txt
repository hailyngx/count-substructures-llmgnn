Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we'll first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5)
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5)

Now, we can count the 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, 2, 3, 5>, <3, 0, 6, 8>, <3, 0, 8, 9>, <3, 6, 8, 9>, <4, 1, 7, 8>, <5, 0, 7, 9>, <5, 7, 8, 9>.
