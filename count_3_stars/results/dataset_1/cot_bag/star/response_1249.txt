Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0:  1 3-star
Node 1:  1 3-star
Node 2:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 4:  1 3-star
Node 9:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 17.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 0, 2>
<2, 1, 3>
<2, 1, 5>
<2, 1, 6>
<2, 1, 9>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 3, 6>
<2, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 6>
<2, 5, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 9, 5>
<2, 9, 6>
<2, 9, 7>
<4, 0, 9>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 4, 7>
