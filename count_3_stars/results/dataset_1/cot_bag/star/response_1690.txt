Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: This node has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 7), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4: This node has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6, 7), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 7: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 9: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8), so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from all these nodes: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
