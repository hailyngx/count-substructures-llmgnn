Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the central node.
Node 2 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the central node.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the central node.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star with node 6 as the central node.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the central node.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star with node 8 as the central node.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the central node.

Adding all these up, we have \( 4 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 59 \) 3-stars in total.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
