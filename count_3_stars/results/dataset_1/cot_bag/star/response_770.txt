Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {0, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Since each of these nodes contributes 1 unique 3-star, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
