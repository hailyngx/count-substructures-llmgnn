Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (2, 4, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (0, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 3, 5)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 6)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 5, 7)

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), we find:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up:   <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (2, 0, 4)>, <1, (4, 0, 2)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 0, 9)>, <4, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 3, 5)>, <1, (5, 1, 9)>, <1, (8, 3, 5)>, <1, (8, 6, 5)>. So, the total number of 3-stars = [21].
