Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the center.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center.
3. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
4. Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
5. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8. Hence, there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
6. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9. Hence, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
7. Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13.

So, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>.
