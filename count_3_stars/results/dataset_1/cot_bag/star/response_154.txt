Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given information:  

```
   1 -- 2 -- 3
  
   |    |    |
  
   4 -- 0 -- 7
  
   |    |    |
  
   8 -- 6 -- 9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8.

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33

So, the final answer is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>
