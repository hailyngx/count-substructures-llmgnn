Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1] = 11 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 3)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 4)>
- <3, (5, 9, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
