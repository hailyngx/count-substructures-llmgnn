Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 8)

We can see that node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form ` inom{5}{3} = 10 ` 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is `[10]`.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 7, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 1)>
<6, (4, 5, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<6, (5, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (7, 3, 4)>
