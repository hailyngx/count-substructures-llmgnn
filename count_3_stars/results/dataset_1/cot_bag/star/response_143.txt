Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the number of nodes and edges, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 2), (9, 4)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 5, 9), forming 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
