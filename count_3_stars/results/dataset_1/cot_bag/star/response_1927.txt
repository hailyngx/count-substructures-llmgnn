Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the 3-stars from each node: 
1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
