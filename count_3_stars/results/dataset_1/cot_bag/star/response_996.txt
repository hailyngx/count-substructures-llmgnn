Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {9}
- Node 2: {0, 9}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8}

Considering the above neighbors, here are the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, and <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
