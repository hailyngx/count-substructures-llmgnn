Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:
1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (5 and 8), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, and 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 5 has 2 neighbors (0 and 1), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, and 3), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
5. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, and 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, and 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13.
