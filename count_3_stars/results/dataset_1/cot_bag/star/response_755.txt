Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 5, 7, 9.

We calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 1)>, <7, (2, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 0 + 10 + 1] = [21]
