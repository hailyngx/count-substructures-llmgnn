Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they are the potential centers of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 4
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10] = [24] \)

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 1)>
