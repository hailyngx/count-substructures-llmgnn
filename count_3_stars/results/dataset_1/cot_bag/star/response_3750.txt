Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

We will only consider the nodes with three or more neighbors for forming 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
Node 1:
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 1
Total: 1

Node 2:
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 2
Total: 2

Node 7:
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 7
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 7
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 7
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 7
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 7
Total: 7

Node 8:
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 8
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 8
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 8
- 1 3-star can be formed with Node 8
Total: 11

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 2 + 7 + 11 = 21.

Thus, the final answer is [21].

List of unique 3-stars found:

- <2, 1, 4>
- <2, 7, 0>
- <2, 7, 3>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <7, 0, 2>
- <7, 2, 8>
- <7, 8, 1>
- <7, 8, 5>
- <8, 1, 4>
- <8, 1, 6>
