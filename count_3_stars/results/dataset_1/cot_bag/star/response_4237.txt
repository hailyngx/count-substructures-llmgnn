Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first organize the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edge information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <6, (0, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
