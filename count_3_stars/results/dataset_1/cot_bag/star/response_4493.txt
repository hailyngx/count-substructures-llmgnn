Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 36 \)

So, there are 36 3-stars in this graph. 
In <> format, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 0, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
