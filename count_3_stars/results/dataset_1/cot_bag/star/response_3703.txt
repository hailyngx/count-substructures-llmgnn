Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph based on the given edges:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
  - 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 3, 7 (not enough neighbors for a 3-star)

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 1
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 4)>
  - 3-star: <3, (4, 1, 7)>
  - 3-star: <3, (4, 7, 1)>
  - 3-star: <3, (7, 1, 4)>
  - 3-star: <3, (7, 4, 1)>

- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 3, 7 (not enough neighbors for a 3-star)

- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9 (not enough neighbors for a 3-star)

- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 9 (not enough neighbors for a 3-star)

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4
  - 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
  - 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 1)>
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 0, 4)>
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 0)>
  - 3-star: <7, (4, 0, 1)>
  - 3-star: <7, (4, 1, 0)>

- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 3 (not enough neighbors for a 3-star)

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
  - 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 6)>
  - 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 5)>
  - 3-star: <9, (5, 0, 6)>
  - 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 0)>
  - 3-star: <9, (6, 0, 5)>
  - 3-star: <9, (6, 5, 0)>

In total, there are 12 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 4)>, <3, (4, 1, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (7, 1, 4)>, <3, (7, 4, 1)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 1)>, <7, (1, 0, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 0)>, <7, (4, 0, 1)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
