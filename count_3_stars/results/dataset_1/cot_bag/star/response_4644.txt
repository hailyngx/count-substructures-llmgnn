Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
0: 3, 5, 6
1: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
2: 1, 5
3: 0, 5, 8
4: 1, 6, 7
5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
6: 0, 4, 7
7: 4, 6, 8
8: 1, 3, 7
9: 1, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars and count them:

\[ \text{3-stars for node 0: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<0, (3, 5, 6)>

\[ \text{3-stars for node 1: } \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>

\[ \text{3-stars for node 3: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<3, (0, 5, 8)>

\[ \text{3-stars for node 4: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<4, (1, 6, 7)>

\[ \text{3-stars for node 5: } \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
<5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>

\[ \text{3-stars for node 6: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<6, (0, 4, 7)>

\[ \text{3-stars for node 8: } \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [25].
