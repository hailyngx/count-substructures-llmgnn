Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms two 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)> and <2, (1, 4, 6)>
Node 4 forms three 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, and <4, (2, 6, 9)>
Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 9)>
Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 8)>

So, there are a total of 8 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final result is [8].
