Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 5 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [18].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
