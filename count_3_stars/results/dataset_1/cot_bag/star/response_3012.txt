Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6

Let's count the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least three neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (less than 3): 0 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 0, 9>
- <2, 1, 4>
- <4, 2, 5>
- <9, 0, 5>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
