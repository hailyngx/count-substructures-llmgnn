Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given edge list, nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
  <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = [24]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 24, and the unique 3-stars are as listed above inside <> brackets.
