Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
0: 2, 3  
1: 4, 9  
2: 0, 5, 7, 8  
3: 0, 4  
4: 1, 3  
5: 2  
6: 8  
7: 2  
8: 2, 6  
9: 1

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0  
Node 1: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0  
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
Node 3: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0  
Node 4: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0  
Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>.
