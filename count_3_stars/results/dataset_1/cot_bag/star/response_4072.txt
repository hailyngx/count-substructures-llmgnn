Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph is shown below:

```
      0 --- 6     9
     / \    |    / 
    /   \   |   /  
   8     1  7  2   
             / \  
            4   3
             \ / 
              5   
```

Based on the given information, we will first find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (6, 8), so it can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors (6, 7), so it can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors (3, 7), so it can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 8), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <(2, 4, 5), 3>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <(2, 4, 8), 3>.
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <(3, 5, 6), 4>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <(3, 5, 7), 4>.
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors (3, 4), so it can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7, 8), so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <(0, 1, 4), 6>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <(0, 1, 7), 6>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <(0, 1, 8), 6>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <(1, 4, 7), 6>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <(1, 4, 8), 6>.
8. Node 7 has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9), so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <(1, 4, 6), 7>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <(1, 4, 8), 7>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <(1, 6, 8), 7>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <(1, 6, 9), 7>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <(4, 6, 8), 7>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <(4, 6, 9), 7>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <(4, 8, 9), 7>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <(6, 8, 9), 7>.
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 7), so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <(0, 3, 6), 8>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <(0, 3, 7), 8>.

Hence, there are a total of 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 42 3-stars.

Thus, the completed answer is: [42].
