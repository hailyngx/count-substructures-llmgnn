Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (6, 0), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors
Node 1 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 20 = 28

Therefore, there are 28 3-stars in this graph. 

Inside brackets: [28]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>
