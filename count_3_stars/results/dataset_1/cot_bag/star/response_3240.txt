Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<9, (4, 5, 7)>.
