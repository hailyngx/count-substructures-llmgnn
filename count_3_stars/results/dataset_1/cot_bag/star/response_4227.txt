Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 0, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 2)>
<4, (2, 0, 3)>
