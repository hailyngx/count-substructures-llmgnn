Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

By examining the list of neighbors, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, and 4. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>.
