Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 6 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 4 + 4 = 28 \). We will now list the unique 3-stars:

[28]
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 0)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 0)>
<0, (4, 6, 0)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 0)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 0, 3)>
