Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph as follows:  

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors (nodes with at least 3 edges). These are nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8. 

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [17] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (6, 5, 7)>
- <2, (6, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 1, 7)>
- <8, (5, 1, 9)>
- <8, (5, 4, 7)>
- <8, (5, 4, 9)>
- <8, (7, 1, 5)>
