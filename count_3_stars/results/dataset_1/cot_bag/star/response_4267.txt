Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed as follows:

- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 7)>
Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
