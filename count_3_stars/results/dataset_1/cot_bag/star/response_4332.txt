Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 1, 6

Now, we'll determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1: has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
2. Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 3: has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are: 
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 0, 4)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
