Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9 satisfy this condition. 

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, it has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 8, 9), so the number of 3-stars is $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $.

For node 1, it has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 9), so the number of 3-stars is $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $.

For node 4, it has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6), so the number of 3-stars is 1.

For node 6, it has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4), so the number of 3-stars is $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $.

For node 9, it has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5, 7), so the number of 3-stars is $ \binom{6}{3} = 20 $.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have $ 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 33 $. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
