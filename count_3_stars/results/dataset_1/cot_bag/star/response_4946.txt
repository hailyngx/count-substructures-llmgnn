Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes which have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 1, and 4
- Node 3 has neighbors 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 2, and 7
- Node 5 has neighbors 3, 7, and 9
- Node 8 has neighbors 1 and 3
- Node 9 has neighbors 3 and 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>

Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>

Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>

Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars

Node 9: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 8

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [8].
