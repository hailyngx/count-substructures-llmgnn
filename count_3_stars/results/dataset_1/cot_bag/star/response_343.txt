Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see which ones form 3-stars.

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1 and 8.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (6, 2, 4)>, <3, (8, 0, 9)>.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 4)>.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [7].
