Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the central node: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the central node: <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the central node: <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 5)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the central node: <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].
