Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 1: (0, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)
Node 2: (1, 3, 6)
Node 3: (2, 4, 6, 7)
Node 4: (0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9)
Node 5: (1, 7, 8)
Node 6: (1, 2, 3)
Node 7: (1, 3, 4, 5)
Node 8: (1, 4, 5)
Node 9: (4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up, we have a total of \( 10 + 20 = 30 \) 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (7, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (7, 4, 8)>
