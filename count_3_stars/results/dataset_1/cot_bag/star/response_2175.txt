Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 4

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 2 and node 9, they have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} \) 3-stars each:
\[ \binom{4}{3} +  \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 4 = 8 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8.

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>. 

So, the final answer is  [8].
