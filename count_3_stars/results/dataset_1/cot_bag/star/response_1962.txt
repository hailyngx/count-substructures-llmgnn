Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's analyze the nodes that have three or more neighbors to identify the 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in total. 

The unique 3-stars found inside <> are: 
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
