Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it also forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
7. Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 60 \).

Thus, the final answer is [60] and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
