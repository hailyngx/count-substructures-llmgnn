Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {2, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {6}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6}

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars formed:

Calculations:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].
