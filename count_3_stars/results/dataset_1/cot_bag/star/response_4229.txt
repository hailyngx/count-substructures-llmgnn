Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 8)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 16 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
