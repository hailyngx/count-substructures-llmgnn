Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node and see if it can form a 3-star.

Node 0 has neighbors 7 and 8.
Node 1 has neighbors 8 and 9.
Node 2 has neighbors 4, 6, and 7.
Node 3 has neighbors 5 and 9.
Node 4 has neighbors 2, 5, and 7.
Node 5 has neighbors 3 and 4.
Node 6 has neighbor 2.
Node 7 has neighbors 0, 2, 4, and 9.
Node 8 has neighbors 0, 1, and 9.
Node 9 has neighbors 1, 3, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
