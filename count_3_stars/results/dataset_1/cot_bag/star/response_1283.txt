Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we analyze each node based on its degree.

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming 4 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Counting the 3-stars formed, we find a total of [1 + 4] = 5 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>.
