Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding them up, we have \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 79 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [79].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>
