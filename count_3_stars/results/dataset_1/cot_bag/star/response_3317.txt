Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will now identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: It has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 7, 9), forming \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
  <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 1: It has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8, 9), forming \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
  <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8), forming 1 3-star.
  <2, (0, 6, 8)>

- Node 4: It has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 5), forming 4 3-stars.
  <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 9), forming 4 3-stars.
  <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>

- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 6), forming 1 3-star.
  <8, (1, 2, 6)>

- Node 9: It has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7), forming 10 3-stars.
  <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [30].
