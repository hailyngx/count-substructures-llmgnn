Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we need to identify which nodes have three or more edges connected to them. Then, we'll count the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

From the given edge list, we can see that the nodes with three or more edges connected to them are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
   <0, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
   <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
   <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, putting all the unique 3-stars together, we get [ 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 ] = 6.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.
