Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3)

Now, let's analyze the nodes to see which ones have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: Degree 3
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \)

So, the final answer is: [12]

List of unique 3-stars:
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
