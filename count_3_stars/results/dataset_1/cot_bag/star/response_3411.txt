Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 6, 3, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)

Summing these up, we get \(4+4+10+10+1+1 = 30\).

So, there are 30 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<[0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 5], [0, 2, 6], [0, 2, 7], [0, 5, 6], [0, 5, 7], [0, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 6], [1, 3, 9], [1, 5, 6], [1, 5, 7], [1, 6, 7], [1, 6, 9], [5, 6, 7], [5, 6, 8], [6, 7, 8], [8, 5, 6], [8, 5, 7], [8, 5, 9], [8, 6, 7], [8, 6, 9], [8, 7, 5], [8, 7, 6], [8, 7, 9], [9, 1, 3], [9, 3, 2], [9, 1, 5], [9, 1, 6], [9, 5, 6]> 

So, the final answer is [30].
