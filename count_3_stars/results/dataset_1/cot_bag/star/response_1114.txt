Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9. 

For node 0: 
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 8)>

For node 6: 
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <6, (0, 7, 9)>

For node 7: 
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 6, 1)>

For node 9: 
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7.
