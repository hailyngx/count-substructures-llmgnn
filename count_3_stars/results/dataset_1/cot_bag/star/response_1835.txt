Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8)]

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
    - Total 3-stars with node 0: [10 choose 3] = 120

- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
    - Total 3-stars with node 1: [10 choose 3] = 120

- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 5, 8
    - Total 3-stars with node 2: [3 choose 3] = 1

- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 5
    - Total 3-stars with node 3: 0

- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6
    - Total 3-stars with node 4: [3 choose 3] = 1

- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
    - Total 3-stars with node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10

- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8
    - Total 3-stars with node 6: [4 choose 3] = 4

- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5
    - Total 3-stars with node 7: 0

- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
    - Total 3-stars with node 8: [5 choose 3] = 10

- Node 9 has neighbors: 8
    - Total 3-stars with node 9: 0

Combining all the 3-stars found with each node, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [120 + 120 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 266. 

Therefore, the final answer is [266].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
