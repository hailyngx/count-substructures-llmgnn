Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. Let's analyze each node to see if they form any 3-stars.

Looking at each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors. There are 4 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors. There are 4 3-stars: <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 7)>.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors. There are 20 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 4, 3)>, <7, (1, 5, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 3)>, <7, (2, 5, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 4)>.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors. There are 10 3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 3)>, <8, (0, 5, 3)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 3)>, <8, (0, 5, 4)>.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in the given graph.
