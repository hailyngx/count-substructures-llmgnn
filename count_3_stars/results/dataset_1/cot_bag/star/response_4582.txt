Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 5, and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
It has 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7), so the number of 3-stars centered at node 0 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 5:
It has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 9), so the number of 3-stars centered at node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 7:
It has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 9), so the number of 3-stars centered at node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, and we can represent them as follows:
\[ [30] \]
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>
