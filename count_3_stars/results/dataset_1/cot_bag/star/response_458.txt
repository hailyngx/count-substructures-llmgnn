Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 4, 8} - forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 5, 6} - forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 7, 8} - forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6} - forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 4, 6} - forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 5, 7} - forms 1 3-star
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 9} - forms 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph (inside []) is: [7]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
