Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 28 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
