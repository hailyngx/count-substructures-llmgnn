Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 0)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 0, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 0)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 0, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
