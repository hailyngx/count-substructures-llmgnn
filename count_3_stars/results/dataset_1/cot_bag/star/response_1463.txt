Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph with 10 nodes and the given 26 edges:

- Node 0 is connected to node 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5
- Node 4 is connected to node 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to node 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 8

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to determine how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
