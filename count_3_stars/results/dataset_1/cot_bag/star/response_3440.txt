Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 8).
   - It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

2. Node 2 has 2 neighbors (5, 9).
   - It cannot form any 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.

3. Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0, 7).
   - It cannot form any 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.

4. Node 5 has 2 neighbors (2, 8).
   - It cannot form any 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors. 

5. Node 6 has 1 neighbor (0).
   - It cannot form any 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.

6. Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 8).
   - It can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7).
   - It can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

8. Node 9 has 1 neighbor (2).
   - It cannot form any 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 8, 1)>
- <0, (7, 8, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 7, 1)>
- <8, (0, 7, 5)>
- <8, (0, 7, 3)>
- <8, (7, 0, 1)>
