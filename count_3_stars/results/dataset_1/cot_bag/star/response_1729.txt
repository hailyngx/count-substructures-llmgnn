Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The list of nodes and edges given forms the following graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 2), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6)

We'll now determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the above information:
- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [23] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>.
