Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first list the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 3
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star

There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
