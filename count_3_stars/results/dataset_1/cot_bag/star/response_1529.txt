Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 0, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [35 + 4 + 1] = 40 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
