Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Let's go through each node to determine the 3-stars present. 

For node 0: Node 0 has 2 neighbors (3, 8), so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 1: Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7). This means there is 1 3-star for node 1, which is <1, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 3: Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9). This means there are 4 3-stars for node 3: <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>.

For node 4: Node 4 has 1 neighbor (8), so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 5: Node 5 has 2 neighbors (1, 7), so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 7: Node 7 has 2 neighbors (1, 5), so it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4). This means there is 1 3-star for node 8, which is <8, (0, 3, 4)>.

For node 9: Node 9 has 1 neighbor (3), so it cannot form any 3-star.

Counting up the total number of 3-stars, we have 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>.
