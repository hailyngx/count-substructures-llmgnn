Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<1, (5, 0, 7)>
<2, (3, 9, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (5, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
