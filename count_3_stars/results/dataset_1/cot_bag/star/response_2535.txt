Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 6), (9, 1)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4
Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
