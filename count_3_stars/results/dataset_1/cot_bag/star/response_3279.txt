Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 4), (7, 2), (8, 4)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 4)
    - 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (0)
    - No 3-stars
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (5, 7)
    - No 3-stars
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (4, 5)
    - No 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 3, 6, 8, 0)
    - 1 3-star
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
    - No 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (4)
    - No 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (2)
    - No 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (4)
    - No 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 neighbors
    - No 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{10}{3} = 120 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>
