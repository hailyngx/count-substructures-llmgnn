Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first construct the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, and then count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
(0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9) 
(1, 2), (1, 9) 
(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3) 
(3, 2), (3, 8) 
(4, 5), (4, 6) 
(5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9) 
(6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8) 
(7, 5), (7, 6) 
(8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6) 
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5)

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

For node 0: it has 4 neighbors (node 2, 6, 8, 9)
  The number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( {\binom{4}{3}} = 4 \)
  <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 5: it has 5 neighbors (node 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
  The number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = \( {\binom{5}{3}} = 10 \)
  <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4 + 10 = 14.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
