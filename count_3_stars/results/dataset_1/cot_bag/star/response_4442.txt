Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list them in the specified format, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {0, 7, 9}
- Number of 3-stars: There's only 1 3-star as there are exactly 3 neighbors.
- Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 7, 9)>

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {3, 4, 9}
- Number of 3-stars: There's only 1 3-star as there are exactly 3 neighbors.
- Unique 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {0, 6, 7, 6}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>

For Node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>

For Node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 9, 9}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

For Node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [27].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.
