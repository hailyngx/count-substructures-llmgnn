Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6)
Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6)
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5)
Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8)
Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8)
Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)
Node 9: (9, 7), (9, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34 \).

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>.
