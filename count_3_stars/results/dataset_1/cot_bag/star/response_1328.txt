Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 7

Now, we'll identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
    - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
    - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
    - <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets, we have [7].
