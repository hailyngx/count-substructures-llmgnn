Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To begin, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 5
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 3, 5, and 6 are the only nodes with three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-star graphs they are part of:

- For Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- For Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- For Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- For Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 10 + 10 + 4] = 28.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
