Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 4)> and <3, (6, 4, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 3)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (5, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 6)>

Adding these all up, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in this graph.
