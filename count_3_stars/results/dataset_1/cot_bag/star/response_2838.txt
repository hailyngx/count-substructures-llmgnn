Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 2, 3, 5, 6, 9. 

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9.
- We can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 9.
- We can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 9.
- We can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7.
- We can form 1 3-star with node 6 as the center. 
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- We can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( [10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [23] \). 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, and <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
