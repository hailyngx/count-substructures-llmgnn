Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of and then sum all the 3-stars found.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with the nodes it is connected to: (0, 1, 9)
- So, there is 1 3-star with Node 1 as the center.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with the nodes it is connected to: (1, 5, 7)
- So, there is 1 3-star with Node 5 as the center.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with the nodes it is connected to: (1, 5, 7), (3, 7, 8), (6, 7, 4)
- So, there are 3 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 3] = [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (6, 7, 4)>
