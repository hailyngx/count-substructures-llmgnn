Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Since we need to find 3-star graphs, let's first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 22 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [22].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 8, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 4, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (4, 3, 5)>
- <9, (6, 7, 0)>
- <9, (7, 6, 0)>
- <9, (7, 8, 6)>
- <9, (8, 7, 6)>
- <9, (7, 8, 3)>
- <9, (8, 7, 3)>
