Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 5, 7>
<0, 3, 6, 7>
<0, 4, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 6, 7>
<1, 4, 5, 7>
<1, 7, 9>
<2, 3, 6, 7>
<2, 7, 9> 

Therefore, the final answer is: [42].
