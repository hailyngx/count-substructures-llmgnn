Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

Putting the final number of 3-stars inside brackets: [13]

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
