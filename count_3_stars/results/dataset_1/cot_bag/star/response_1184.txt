Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars.

- Node 2 has neighbors 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 6 has neighbors 4 and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbors 2 and 4.
- Node 9 has neighbors 2 and 6.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- For node 8: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star
- For node 9: Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 8, 6)>
- <4, (5, 8, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 0)>
