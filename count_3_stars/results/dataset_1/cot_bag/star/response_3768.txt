Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 4, and 6. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 9, 6)>, <3, (4, 9, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 25
Therefore, the final answer is [25].
