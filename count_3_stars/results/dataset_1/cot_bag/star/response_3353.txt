Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see which ones form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3: 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 9), forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 5: 5 has 2 neighbors (1, 3) which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 6: 6 has 2 neighbors (0, 8) which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7: 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 8), forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8: 8 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 9), forming 4 3-stars.
- Node 9: 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8), forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 11 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 3)>
- <8, (9, 3, 0)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 8, 8)>
