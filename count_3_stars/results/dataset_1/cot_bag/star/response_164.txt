Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph:

                            1
                             \
                              9
                             /
            2 - 3 - 9 - 4
            |       |  /
            7 - 5 - 6 - 0 - 8

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0, 3, 5, 6, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>
