Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)

Adding these up, we get a total of \(1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11\) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is \([11]\).

The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>     
<1, (0, 4, 5)>    
<3, (0, 4, 6)>    
<4, (1, 3, 5)>    
<6, (0, 3, 4)>    
<0, (1, 3, 6)>    
<1, (0, 4, 5)>    
<3, (0, 4, 6)>    
<4, (1, 3, 5)>    
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
