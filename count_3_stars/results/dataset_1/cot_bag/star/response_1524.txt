Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43

So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [43].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>.
