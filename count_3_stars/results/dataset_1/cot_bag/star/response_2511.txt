Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: with neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: with neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
- Node 6: with neighbors {2, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Node 7: with neighbors {2, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Node 8: with neighbors {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Node 9: with neighbors {2, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars gives us a total of 28 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [28].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 2)>
- <3, (1, 8, 2)>
- <3, (5, 2, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 2)>
- <3, (7, 5, 2)>
