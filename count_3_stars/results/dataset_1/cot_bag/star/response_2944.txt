Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually. 

The graph has the following nodes and edges: 
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 8), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 8)}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed using that node.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars. 
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [15].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
