Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each qualifying node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
