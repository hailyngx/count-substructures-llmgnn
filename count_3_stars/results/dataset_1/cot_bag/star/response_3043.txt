Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look at each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.   
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4), so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 2 has 8 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9), so it forms \( \binom{8}{3} = 56\) 3-stars.  
Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6, 9), so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.  
Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 8), so it forms 10 3-stars.  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.  
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (2, 3), so it doesn't form any 3-stars.  
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 9), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.  
Node 9 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 8), so it forms 10 3-stars.  

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(4 + 1 + 56 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 96\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [96].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>

<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 0, 3)>
<5, (8, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
