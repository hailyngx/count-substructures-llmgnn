Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 1.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6, 7), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 4.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 8), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7), so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 8.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 1), so there are no 3-stars with node 9.

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 90 \) 3-stars in total.
So, the final count is [90].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 2)>
- <2, (4, 7, 1)>
- <2, (4, 3, 7)>
- <3, (6, 0, 8)>
- <3, (6, 8, 4)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 8, 2)>
- <6, (8, 0, 3)>
- <6, (8, 3, 4)>
- <8, (6, 0, 3)>
- <8, (6, 3, 4)>
