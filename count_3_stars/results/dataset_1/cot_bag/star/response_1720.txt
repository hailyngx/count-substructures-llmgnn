Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Degree 2 (not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 1: Degree 1 (not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 2: Degree 2 (not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 3: Degree 3 (Forms 1 3-star)
  - <3, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 4: Degree 4 (Forms 4 3-stars)
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 5: Degree 1 (not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 6: Degree 2 (not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 7: Degree 4 (Forms 4 3-stars)
  - <7, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <7, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (8, 4, 9)>

- Node 8: Degree 4 (Forms 4 3-stars)
  - <8, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (2, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (7, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (7, 4, 9)>

- Node 9: Degree 3 (Forms 1 3-star)
  - <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
