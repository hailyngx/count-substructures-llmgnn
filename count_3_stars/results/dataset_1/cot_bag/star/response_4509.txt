Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5
- Node 7: 5, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7

Now, we can go through each node to determine the 3-stars that can be formed. 

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1, <1, (5, 6, 9)>]
- Node 2: [0] (Doesn't have enough neighbors)
- Node 4: [1, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (6, 5, 1)>]
- Node 5: [1, <5, (1, 6, 9)>]
- Node 6: [1, <6, (1, 4, 5)>]
- Node 7: [0] (Doesn't have enough neighbors)
- Node 8: [0] (Doesn't have enough neighbors)
- Node 9: [1, <9, (1, 5, 7)>]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [9] 3-stars.
