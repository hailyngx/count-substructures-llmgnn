Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 22 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [22].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
