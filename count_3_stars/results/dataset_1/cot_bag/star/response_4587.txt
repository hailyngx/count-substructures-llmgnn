Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the given edges are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 1] = 11 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 3)>
