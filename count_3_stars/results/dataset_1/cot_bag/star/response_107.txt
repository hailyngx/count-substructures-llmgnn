Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Next, I will calculate the number of 3-stars and list them.

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 8
- 3-star count: [1] (3-star with central node 0, and leaves 1, 8)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 8)>

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8
- 3-star count: [1] (3-star with central node 1, and leaves 0, 3, 8)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 5, 9
- No 3-stars

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 1, 7, 8
- 3-star count: [1] (3-star with central node 3, and leaves 1, 7, 8)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 7
- No 3-stars

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 2, 8
- No 3-stars

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 9
- No 3-stars

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 3, 4
- No 3-stars

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5
- 3-star count: [1] (3-star with central node 8, and leaves 0, 1, 3)
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 3)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 2, 6
- No 3-stars

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>
