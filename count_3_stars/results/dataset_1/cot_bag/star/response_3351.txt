Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (3, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (2, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (3, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (5), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 5), so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed gives us a total of 15 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 9, 4)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, 1)>
<5, (3, 8, 6)>
<6, (9, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 0, 4)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<8, (5, 2, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 1)>
