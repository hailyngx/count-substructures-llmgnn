Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

The graph consists of 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9

For node 1: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>

For node 2: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 4: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (1, 6, 7)>

For node 6: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

For node 7: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

For node 9: Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6]
