Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes and 22 edges in the graph. Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-star configurations can be formed.

- Node 0: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7). So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. 
- Node 1: This node has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 7). So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2: This node has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9). So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 3: This node has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9). So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8). So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 6: This node has 1 neighbor (1), which is less than 3.
- Node 7: This node has 2 neighbors (0, 1), which is less than 3.
- Node 8: This node has 2 neighbors (2, 4), which is less than 3.
- Node 9: This node has 2 neighbors (2, 3), which is less than 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
