Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) giving 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 4)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) giving 1 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) giving 10 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 9, 7)>, <6, (0, 9, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 8, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 2)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (9, 2, 3)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) giving 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) giving 4 3-stars: <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is calculated as [0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 23.

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 4)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 9, 7)>, <6, (0, 9, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 8, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 2)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (9, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 7, 5)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>.

Putting the final count in brackets, we have: [23].
