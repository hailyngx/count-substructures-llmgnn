Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: 1 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>
