Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 3       4 -- 7
     \    \     /
      \    \   /
       6 -- 2 -- 8
        \    |  /
         \   | /
           5 - 0
```

Following the instructions, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
