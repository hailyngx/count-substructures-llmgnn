Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars for each node and sum them up:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 also has 4 neighbors, resulting in 4 additional 3-stars.  
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  

Adding them up gives a total of \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 38 \) 3-stars. 

Thus, the final answer is [38].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, and <6, (0, 1, 8)>.
