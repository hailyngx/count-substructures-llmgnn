Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) and then list the unique 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so there are 4 3-stars. <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 4, 9)>, <0, (8, 4, 9)>.

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so there is 1 3-star. <1, (0, 2, 8)>.

For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), so there is 1 3-star. <4, (6, 8, 9)>.

For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), so there are 4 3-stars. <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.

Summing up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 10 unique 3-stars.
