Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors are nodes 2 and 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are nodes 0 and 5
- Node 3: Neighbor is node 4
- Node 4: Neighbors are nodes 3 and 6
- Node 5: Neighbor is node 2
- Node 6: Neighbor is node 4
- Node 7: Neighbors are nodes 8 and 9
- Node 8: Neighbor is node 7
- Node 9: Neighbors are nodes 0 and 7

From the above information, we can see that the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and therefore have the potential to form 3-stars are nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9.

Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph, and the total number of 3-stars [] is 0.
