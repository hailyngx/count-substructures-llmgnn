Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: Only 1 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>
