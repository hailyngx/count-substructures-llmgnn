Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0}
- Node 8: {5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For node 6: inom{6}{3} = 20

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
