Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: node 0 and node 5.

For node 0:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 0 as the center. 
<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 5:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 5 as the center.
<5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 4 = 14].
