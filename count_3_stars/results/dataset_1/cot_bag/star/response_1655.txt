Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [14]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
