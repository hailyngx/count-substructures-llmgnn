Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below for reference:

Node 0: 1, 3, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 2: 4, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 9
Node 5: 1, 3
Node 6: 1, 3, 8
Node 7: 2, 4, 8
Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
Node 3: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
