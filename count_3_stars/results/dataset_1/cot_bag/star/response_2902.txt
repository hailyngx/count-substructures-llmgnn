Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 34

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [34].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
