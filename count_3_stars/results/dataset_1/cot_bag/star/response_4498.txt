Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 8}

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: None (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: None (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 5: 1 <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 6: 1 <6, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
