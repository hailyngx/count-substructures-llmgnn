Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will first represent the graph visually. 

The adjacency list for the graph is:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 6

Now, we will determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 1: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 2: forms 1 3-star <2, (0, 1, 5)> with its neighbors 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 3: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5: forms 1 3-star <5, (0, 2, 8)> with its neighbors 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 6: forms 3 3-stars <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)> with various combinations of its neighbors.
- Node 7: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9: has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

There are 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 3-stars in total.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, and <6, (3, 7, 9)>.
