Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph using the information provided:

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 6), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2, node 3, node 4, and node 6 all have more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the 3-stars around these nodes.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
- Number of 3-stars at node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6
- Number of 3-stars at node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars at node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 35 = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
