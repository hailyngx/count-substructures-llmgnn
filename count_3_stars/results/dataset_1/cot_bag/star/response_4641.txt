Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    1 -- 5 -- 9
   /          |
  0 -- 2      7
   \___|______|
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1+4 = 5, which can be represented as [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
