Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node. Let's go through this step by step:

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars in the graph.
