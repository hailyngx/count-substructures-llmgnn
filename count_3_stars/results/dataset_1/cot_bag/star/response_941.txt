Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 56 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 86 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [86].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)> <0, (1, 4, 8)> <0, (1, 7, 8)> <0, (4, 7, 8)> <1, (0, 4, 7)> <1, (0, 4, 8)> <1, (0, 7, 8)> <1, (4, 7, 8)> <4, (0, 1, 7)> <4, (0, 1, 8)> <4, (0, 7, 8)> <4, (1, 7, 8)> <5, (0, 1, 9)> <7, (0, 1, 4)> <7, (0, 1, 8)> <7, (1, 4, 8)> <8, (0, 1, 7)>
