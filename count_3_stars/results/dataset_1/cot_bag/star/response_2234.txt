Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (exactly 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star)
For node 2: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \)  (less than 3 neighbors)
For node 4: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)  (node 4 forms 56 3-stars)
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (exactly 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star)
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  (node 9 forms 4 3-stars)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 56 + 1 + 4 = 62 \)

So, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
