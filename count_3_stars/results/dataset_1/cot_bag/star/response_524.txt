Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up, we get a total of 23 3-stars.
Therefore, the final count is [23].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
