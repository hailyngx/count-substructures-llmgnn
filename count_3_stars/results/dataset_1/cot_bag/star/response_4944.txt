Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
