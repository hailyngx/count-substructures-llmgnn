Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Edges: (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: There are 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 9)
Number of 3-stars at node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2: There are 2 neighbors (1, 9)
Number of 3-stars at node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 3: There are 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9)
Number of 3-stars at node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 4: There are 2 neighbors (3, 6)
Number of 3-stars at node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 6: There are 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 9)
Number of 3-stars at node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 9: There are 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 6)
Number of 3-stars at node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, there are 19 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (7, 9, 6)>, <1, (2, 9, 6)>, <1, (2, 7, 6)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (6, 2, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 4)>, 
<1, (6, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 4)>
