Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the list of edges given, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have at least three neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 9) = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
