Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [4].
