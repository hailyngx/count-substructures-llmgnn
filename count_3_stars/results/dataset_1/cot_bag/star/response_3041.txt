Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 10 nodes in the graph. Let's analyze each node to see if they have three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9) -> [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9) -> 1 3-star
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (0, 1) -> No 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 6) -> 1 3-star
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (8, 9) -> No 3-stars
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (0, 4) -> No 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 9) -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (5) -> No 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 9) -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
