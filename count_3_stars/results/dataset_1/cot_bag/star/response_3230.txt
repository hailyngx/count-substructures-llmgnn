Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
- The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from these 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Total 3-stars with node 1 as the center: [4]
- Unique 3-stars with node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from these 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Total 3-stars with node 4 as the center: [10]
- Unique 3-stars with node 4: <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 8.
- The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from these 6 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Total 3-stars with node 5 as the center: [20]
- Unique 3-stars with node 5: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)> 

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from these 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Total 3-stars with node 6 as the center: [4]
- Unique 3-stars with node 6: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- The number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from these 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Total 3-stars with node 7 as the center: [4]
- Unique 3-stars with node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>

Combining the total number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
Total [4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4] = [42]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>,
<4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>,
<5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>,
<6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>,
<7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>
