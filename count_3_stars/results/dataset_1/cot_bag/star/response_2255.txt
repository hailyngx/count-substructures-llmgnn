Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 0, 3
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 3: 1, 2
Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 4, 6
Node 6: 2, 5, 8
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 2, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 4: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
Node 8: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
Node 9: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: $4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 6)>
