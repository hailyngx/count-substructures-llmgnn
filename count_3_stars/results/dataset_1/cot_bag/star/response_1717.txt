Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 -- 5 -- 1 -- 7
     \       |      \
       \      |       \
         \    |        \
            9 -- 3 -- 2 -- 6
                 |
                 |
                 4 -- 8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 1: 
Node 1 has three neighbors (5, 7, 9), so there is 1 3-star. 
<1, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 2: 
Node 2 has three neighbors (3, 6, 7), so there is 1 3-star. 
<2, (3, 6, 7)>

For node 3: 
Node 3 has four neighbors (2, 4, 9, 9), so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
<3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 9, 9)>, <3, (4, 9, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>

For node 4: 
Node 4 has two neighbors (3, 8), so there are no 3-stars around node 4.

For node 5: 
Node 5 has three neighbors (0, 1, 9), so there is 1 3-star. 
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 9: 
Node 9 has three neighbors (1, 3, 5), so there is 1 3-star. 
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Putting it all together: 
There are 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
