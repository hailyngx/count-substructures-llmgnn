Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 2, node 6, and node 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2 with 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 9):
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \] 3-stars.

For node 6 with 6 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9):
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] 3-stars.

For node 9 with 7 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8):
\[ \binom{7}{3} = 35 \] 3-stars.

There's only 1 3-star for node 2.
There are no 3-stars for nodes with fewer than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 35 + 1 = 66 \) [66].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
