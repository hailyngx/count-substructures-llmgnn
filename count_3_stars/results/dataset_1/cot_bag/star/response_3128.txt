Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes and 32 edges in this graph. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 4, 5)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (2, 4, 6, 7)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 4, 7)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (0, 6, 8, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 3, 8, 9)
  - Number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 16 \). 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>.
