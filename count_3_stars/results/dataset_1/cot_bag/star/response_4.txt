Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:
0: 3, 6, 7
1: 4, 9
2: 3, 9
3: 0, 2, 4, 7
4: 1, 3
5: 6, 7
6: 0, 5, 7, 8
7: 0, 3, 5, 6
8: 6
9: 1, 2

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 3 3-stars [0, (3, 6, 7)], [0, (3, 6, 7)], [0, (6, 3, 7)]
Node 3 has 4 3-stars [3, (0, 2, 4)], [3, (0, 4, 7)], [3, (2, 0, 7)], [3, (4, 0, 7)]
Node 6 has 4 3-stars [6, (0, 5, 7)], [6, (0, 7, 3)], [6, (5, 7, 0)], [6, (7, 0, 3)]
Node 7 has 4 3-stars [7, (0, 3, 5)], [7, (0, 3, 6)], [7, (3, 0, 6)], [7, (5, 0, 3)]

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of [3 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [15].
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
