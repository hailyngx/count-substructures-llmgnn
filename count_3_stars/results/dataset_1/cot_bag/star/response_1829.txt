Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Putting the information given into a graph format:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Node 2 has 8 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars including node 2.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars including node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 56 + 10 = 66 \).

Putting the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:
[<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>]
