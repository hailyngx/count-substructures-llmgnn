Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- There are no nodes with more than 4 neighbors in this graph, so we don't need to calculate further.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is then \( [1 + 4] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (3, 1, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 3, 9)>
