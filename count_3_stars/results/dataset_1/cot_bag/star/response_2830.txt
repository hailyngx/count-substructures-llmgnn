Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Here are the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors - 8, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors - 5, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors - 8, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors - 0, 2, 6
- Node 9: Neighbors - 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 8, 9)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 5, 6)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (has exactly 2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 0, 2) and 1 3-star (8, 0, 6)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (9, 0, 2) and 1 3-star (9, 0, 4) and 1 3-star (9, 0, 5) and 1 3-star (9, 2, 4) and 1 3-star (9, 2, 5) and 1 3-star (9, 4, 5)

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 8, 9>
<1, 5, 6>
<8, 0, 2>
<8, 0, 6>
<9, 0, 2>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 0, 5>
<9, 2, 4>
<9, 2, 5>
