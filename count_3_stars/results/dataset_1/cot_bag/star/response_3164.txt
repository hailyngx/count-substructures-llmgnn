Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 2, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- No other node has three or more neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives 14, so the final count is [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 2, 9>
<2, 1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 0, 1>
<2, 5, 0, 3>
<2, 7, 0, 5>
<5, 0, 1, 9>
<8, 4, 2, 6>
<8, 4, 2, 7>
<8, 4, 6, 7>
<8, 6, 0, 5>
<8, 7, 0, 5>
