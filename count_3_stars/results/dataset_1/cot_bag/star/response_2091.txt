Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node and its neighbors to see if a 3-star can be formed.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, and 8, so it can form 1 3-star.
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>

Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 7, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 2, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9, so it can form 1 3-star.
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>

Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 0, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 0, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9, so it can form 1 3-star.
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4, 7, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
