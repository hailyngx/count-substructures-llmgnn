Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
This graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges can be visually represented as follows:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6.
Node 1 is connected to node 6.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7.
Node 3 is connected to node 5.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6.

To find the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient to form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is insufficient to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 3 + 5] = [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 2, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 6, 7)>.
