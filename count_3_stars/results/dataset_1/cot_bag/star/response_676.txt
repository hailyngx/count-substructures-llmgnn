Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- 0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- 1: 0, 3
- 2: 0
- 3: 1, 9
- 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- 5: 9
- 6: 4
- 7: 4, 9
- 8: 0, 4
- 9: 0, 3, 5, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is given as [18].
