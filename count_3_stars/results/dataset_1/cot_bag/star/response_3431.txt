Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in the given graph are: 1, 4, 8, and 9.

For node 1:
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 8.
There are no 3-stars formed with node 1 since it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 4:
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9, and 7.
We can form 1 3-star with node 4: <4, (1, 3, 7)>.

For node 8:
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 7.
We can form 1 3-star with node 8: <8, (1, 2, 7)>.

For node 9:
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 4.
We can form 1 3-star with node 9: <9, (0, 3, 4)>.

In total, there are 3 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [3].
