Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
We start by creating the graph based on the provided information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Edges: {(0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 5), (8, 3), (8, 4)}

Now let's analyze each node to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6), hence it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 6)>.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5), hence it forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8), hence it forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6, 7), hence it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 3)>.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>.
