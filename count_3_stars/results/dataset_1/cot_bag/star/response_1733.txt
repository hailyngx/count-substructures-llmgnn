Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We'll start by identifying each node that has three or more neighbors, as those are the nodes from which 3-stars can be formed.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Node 1:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Node 3:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Node 9:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Total number of 3-stars formed = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 51

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 4)>
<6, (7, 9, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 6)>
<9, (2, 8, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 9, 6)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
