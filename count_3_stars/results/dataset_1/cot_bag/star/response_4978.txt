Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.
- Nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have fewer than 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 1: There is only 1 3-star.
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (1, 9, 8)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <0, (8, 1, 9)>
- <0, (8, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 9, 8)>
- <3, (8, 0, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
