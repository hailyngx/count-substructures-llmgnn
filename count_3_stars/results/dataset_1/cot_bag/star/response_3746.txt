Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 20] = 28 \).

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (0, 2, 4)>
- <0, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is 14.
