Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 4)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1: (1, 3, 6, 7) has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: (2, 3, 4, 7) has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: (1, 2, 5, 6) has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: (2, 5, 7, 9) has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: (3, 4, 8) has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: (1, 3, 8) has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: (1, 2, 4, 8) has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: (5, 6, 7) has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: (4) has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 19 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>.
