Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will follow the steps outlined earlier.

First, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38 

Therefore, there are 38 3-stars in the given graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars inside <>:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38].
