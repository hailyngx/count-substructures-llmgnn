Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 25 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is [25].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>
