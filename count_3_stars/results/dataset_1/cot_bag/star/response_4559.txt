Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the connections for each node:
- Node 0: (0, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 9)
- Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Let's now identify the 3-stars present in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 8, 5)>, <9, (1, 8, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 5)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Counting these 3-stars, we have a total of [11] 3-stars present in the graph.
