Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following neighbors:

Node 0: 8, 9

Node 1: 4, 7, 8

Node 2: 7

Node 3: 7, 8

Node 4: 1, 5, 9

Node 5: 4

Node 6: 9

Node 7: 1, 2, 3

Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 9

Node 9: 0, 4, 6, 8

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 2 3-stars.
Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.
Node 9 forms 3 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of [11] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (4, 8)>
<4, (1, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 8)>
<9, (4, 8)>
