Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated for each node that has three or more neighbors.

For the given graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9), so it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8), so it forms 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 8.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)> 

So, the final representation is [8] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>.
