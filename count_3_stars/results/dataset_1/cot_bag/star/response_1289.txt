Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [38]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 1)>
- <0, (4, 7, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 1)>
- <4, (1, 5, 0)>
- <4, (5, 0, 7)>
- <4, (5, 0, 1)>
- <4, (5, 7, 0)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 1)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 0)>
- <5, (4, 0, 7)>
- <5, (4, 0, 1)>
- <5, (4, 7, 0)>
- <5, (7, 0, 4)>
- <5, (7, 0, 1)>
- <5, (7, 4, 0)>
- <5, (8, 4, 0)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 3, 5)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (6, 5, 7)>
