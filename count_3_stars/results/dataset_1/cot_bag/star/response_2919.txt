Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

- Node 3: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

- Node 4: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

- Node 8: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

So the total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 19\).

Therefore, the answer is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
