Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 1: 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: 1 neighbor, not enough for 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 3)>, <3, (2, 7, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 4)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: 2 neighbors, not enough for 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 7)>
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 3)>, <7, (0, 6, 3)>
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <8, (4, 6, 5)>
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 23.
List of unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 3)>, <3, (2, 7, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 4)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 3)>, <7, (0, 6, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].
