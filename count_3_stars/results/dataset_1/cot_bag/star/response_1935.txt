Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:   

    0 --- 1     2 --- 7     3 --- 8
    | \   |               /|
    |   \ |              / |
    6 --- 9           4 --- 5

We will now identify the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>

Node 1:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>

Node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>

Node 8:
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: inom{6}{3} = 20
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [23].
