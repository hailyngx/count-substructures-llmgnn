Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    - <4, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <4, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <4, (5, 6, 8)>

- For node 5:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <5, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <5, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <5, (0, 4, 9)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 9)>

- For node 6:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (5, 8, 9)>

- For node 8:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <8, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <8, (1, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44 \).  
So, the total number of unique 3-stars is [44].
