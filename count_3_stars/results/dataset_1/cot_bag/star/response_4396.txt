Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 2
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
