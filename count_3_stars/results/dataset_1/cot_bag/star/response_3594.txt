Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the provided information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 9) -> Total 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8) -> Total 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9) -> Total 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9) -> Total 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9) -> Total 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6) -> Total 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>.
