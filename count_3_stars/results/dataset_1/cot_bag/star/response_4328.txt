Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Node 5 is the only node with at least 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around node 5.

Calculating \( \binom{6}{3} \) gives us 20 possible 3-stars around node 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<5, (2, 3, 7)>  
<5, (2, 3, 8)>  
<5, (2, 3, 9)>  
<5, (2, 7, 8)>  
<5, (2, 7, 9)>  
<5, (2, 8, 9)>  
<5, (3, 7, 8)>  
<5, (3, 7, 9)>  
<5, (3, 8, 9)>  
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
