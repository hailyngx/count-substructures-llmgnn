Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 7.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 0.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 2.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4.


For node 0, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars formed.
For node 1, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed.
For node 2, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars formed.
For node 4, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed.
For node 7, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars formed.
For node 8, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star formed.


So, there are a total of 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 27 3-stars. 

Putting this number in brackets, we get the final answer: [27].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
