Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph based on the given edges:
```
0 -- 3 -- 4 -- 7
|         |    
9         5 -- 2 -- 8
          |         |
          9         |
                    |
                    1
```

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 9.
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 4, 5.
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, 7.
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 3, 4.
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, 8.
- Node 8: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 9.
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 5, 8.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we apply \( \binom{n}{3} \):
  - Node 0: 1 3-star
  - Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
  - Node 9: 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 5

So, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 3, 9>
- <3, 0, 4>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <4, 3, 5>
- <5, 2, 3>
