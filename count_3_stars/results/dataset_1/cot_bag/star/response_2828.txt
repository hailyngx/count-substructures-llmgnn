Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 3
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 0, 2, 5
Node 4: 8
Node 5: 3, 7
Node 7: 5
Node 8: 4

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

There is only 1 3-star in this graph, so the final count is [1].
The unique 3-star in this graph is: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
