Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 1] = 52 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
