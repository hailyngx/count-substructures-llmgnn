Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph can be illustrated as follows:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 1), (8, 4), (9, 3)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0:
- Node 0 connects to nodes 4 and 5. Thus, we can form 1 3-star around node 0: <0, (4, 5)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 connects to nodes 5, 6, and 8. We can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star around node 1: <1, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 connects to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. We can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 4: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 connects to nodes 0 and 1. Thus, we can form 1 3-star around node 5: <5, (0, 1)>

There are a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 3-stars in this graph.
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
