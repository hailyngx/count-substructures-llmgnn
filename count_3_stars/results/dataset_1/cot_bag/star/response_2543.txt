Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first determine the degree of each node, i.e., the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

The nodes with a degree of 3 or more are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node using \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 60 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 0, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 0, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (8, 0, 1)>
