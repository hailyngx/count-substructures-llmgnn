Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 
Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 10 = 50.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Some of the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
