Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
   3 -- 2 -- 4 -- 5
 / |    |       |
0  |    |       |
 \ |    |       |
   6    8 -- 9
```

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are no 3-stars for nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9 since they don't have at least 3 neighbors.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
1. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
