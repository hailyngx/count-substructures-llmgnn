Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.
From the given edges, we can see that the nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (7)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (4, 5, 8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 6)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (6, 8)

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
