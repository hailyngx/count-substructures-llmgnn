Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 2, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 forms 15 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [15 + 6 + 10] = [31]

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
