Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

0: 6, 7  
1: 3, 7, 9  
2: 3, 4, 7  
3: 1, 2, 5, 7  
4: 2, 5, 6, 9  
5: 3, 4, 8, 9  
6: 0, 4  
7: 0, 1, 2, 3  
8: 5  
9: 1, 4, 5  

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [19].  
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>
