Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
