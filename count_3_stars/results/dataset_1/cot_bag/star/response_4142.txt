Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see which ones can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38 \), so we can write the final answer as [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
