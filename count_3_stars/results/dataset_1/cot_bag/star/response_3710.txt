Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 5, 6, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1.
<1, 4, 5, 6>, <1, 4, 5, 9>, <1, 4, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 6, 9>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 6, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star with node 4.
<4, 1, 6, 7>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has neighbors 1, 4, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 6.
<6, 1, 4, 8>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 4, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 7.
<7, 0, 4, 8>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has neighbors 3, 6, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8.
<8, 3, 6, 7>, <8, 3, 6, 9>, <8, 3, 7, 9>, <8, 6, 7, 9>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has neighbors 1 and 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 9.

Putting it all together, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11 \) 3-stars. So, the final answer is [11].
