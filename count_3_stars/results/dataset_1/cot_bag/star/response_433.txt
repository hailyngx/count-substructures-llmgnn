Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 7), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 0)}

Now, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 5 neighbors
Node 7 has 4 neighbors
Node 5 has 3 neighbors

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the final result is [39] with unique 3-stars being <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>.
