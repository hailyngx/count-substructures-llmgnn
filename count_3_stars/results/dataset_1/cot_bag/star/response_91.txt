Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors, along with their neighbors:
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we have \( 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 9 \) 3-stars in total, which gives us a final result of [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
