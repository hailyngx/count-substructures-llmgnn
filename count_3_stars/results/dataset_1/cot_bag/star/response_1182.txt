Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
0: 1, 8  
1: 0, 2, 4  
2: 1, 7, 9  
3: 8  
4: 1, 5  
5: 4, 8, 9  
7: 2  
8: 0, 3, 5, 9  
9: 2, 5, 8  

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0  
Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0  
Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0  
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0  
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1  

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 5  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (0, 2, 4)>  
<2, (1, 7, 9)>  
<5, (4, 8, 9)>  
<8, (0, 3, 5)>  
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
