Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 4 + 1 = 15]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (3,4,6)>
