Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors: <0, 1, 3, 7>.

For node 0, we have 2 possible 3-stars including it: <0, (1, 6, 7)> and <0, (1, 6, 7)>.

For node 1, we have 1 possible 3-star including it: <1, (0, 2, 3)>.

For node 3, we have 2 possible 3-stars including it: <3, (1, 4, 7)> and <3, (4, 7, 8)>.

For node 7, we have 1 possible 3-star including it: <7, (2, 3, 6)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2 + 1 + 2 + 1] = 6. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, and <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
