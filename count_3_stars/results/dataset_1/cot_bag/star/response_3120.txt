Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. 
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 3:
- Total neighbors = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 0

Node 4:
- Total neighbors = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 0

Node 7:
- Total neighbors = 3
- Number of 3-stars = 0

Node 8:
- Total neighbors = 4
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{4}{3} = 4$

Node 9:
- Total neighbors = 5
- Number of 3-stars = $ \binom{5}{3} = 10$

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors = $4 + 10 = 14$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars are <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>,  <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
