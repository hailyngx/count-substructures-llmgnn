Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are no 3-stars for nodes 2 and 9 as they have exactly 3 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
