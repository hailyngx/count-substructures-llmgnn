Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars]
Node 1: 4 neighbors -> [1 3-stars]
Node 2: 4 neighbors -> [1 3-stars]
Node 3: 2 neighbors -> [0 3-stars]
Node 4: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars]
Node 5: 1 neighbor -> [0 3-stars]
Node 6: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars]
Node 7: 5 neighbors -> [5 3-stars]
Node 8: 2 neighbors -> [0 3-stars]
Node 9: 3 neighbors -> [1 3-stars]

Total number of 3-stars: [11]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 2>
<1, 0, 2>
<2, 0, 1>
<1, 2, 4>
<2, 1, 4>
<1, 7, 0>
<2, 7, 0>
<4, 1, 2>
<7, 0, 1>
<7, 2, 0>
<0, 7, 1>
