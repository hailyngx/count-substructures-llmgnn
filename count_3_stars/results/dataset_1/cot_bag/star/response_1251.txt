Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the provided edges:

Node 0: 8
Node 1: 5, 6
Node 2: 4, 6
Node 3: 7
Node 4: 2, 5
Node 5: 1, 4, 9
Node 6: 1, 2, 8
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 0, 6
Node 9: 5

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
