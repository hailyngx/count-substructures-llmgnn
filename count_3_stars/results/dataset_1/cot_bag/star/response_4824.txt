Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 4. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 other neighbors (6, 9), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 9), which means there can be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. These 3-stars are:
  - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
  
For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 9), which means there can be \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center. These 3-stars are:
  - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 4 + 10 = 14. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
