Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 9: inom{1}{3} = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>

So, the final answer is [20].
