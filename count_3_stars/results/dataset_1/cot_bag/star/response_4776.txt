Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's analyze the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <0, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 6, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <2, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <5, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <5, (0, 4, 7)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <6, (0, 3, 5)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
   - <7, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <7, (2, 5, 9)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <7, (2, 6, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
   - <8, (0, 2, 9)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [24].
