Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For node 0: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to select 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are [4] 3-stars in total.
- For node 1: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to select 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are [4] 3-stars in total.
- For node 2: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to select 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are [4] 3-stars in total.
- For node 9: There are 5 choose 3 = 10 ways to select 3 neighbors to form a 3-star. So, there are [10] 3-stars in total.

The final total number of 3-stars is [4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
