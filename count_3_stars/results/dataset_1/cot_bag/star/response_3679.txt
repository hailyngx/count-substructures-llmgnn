Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0

Let's find the total number of 3-stars. Only nodes with three or more neighbors can form 3-stars. 
In this case, nodes 0 and 1 have 5 neighbors each, node 3 has 3 neighbors, and the rest have less than 3 neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [21].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 3)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 3)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>.
