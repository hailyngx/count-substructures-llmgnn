Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2
- Node 9: 1

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 3 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
<5, (0, 2, 6)>

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>

Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 10 = 15, so [15].
