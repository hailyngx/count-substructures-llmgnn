Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's go through each node:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>.
