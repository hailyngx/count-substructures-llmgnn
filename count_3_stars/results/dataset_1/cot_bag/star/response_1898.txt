Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

We will calculate the total number of 3-stars now:

For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 1, 9)>
