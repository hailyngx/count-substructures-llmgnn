Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to determine the 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: has neighbors {2, 3}. Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

- Node 1: has neighbors {4, 8}. Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

- Node 2: has neighbors {0, 5, 7}. It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 3: has neighbors {0, 9}. Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star. 

- Node 4: has neighbors {1, 6, 7, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 5: has neighbors {2}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

- Node 6: has neighbors {4, 9}. Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

- Node 7: has neighbors {2, 4, 8}. It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 8: has neighbors {1, 4, 7}. It forms 1 3-star.

- Node 9: has neighbors {3, 6}. Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars formed in this graph are:
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
