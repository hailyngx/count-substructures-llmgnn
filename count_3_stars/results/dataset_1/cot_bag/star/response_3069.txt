Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:
```
         0
        /
       7
       |\
       | 1
       |/
       9
      /|\
     2-5-4
      \
       3
        \
         8
```

Now, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 9) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (2, 8) -> No 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 9, 4) -> 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors (0, 2) -> No 3-stars
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (3, 9) -> No 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 8, 9) -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 10] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 9, 4)>, <2, (7, 9, 9)>, <5, (2, 9, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>
