Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 9, 8)>, <1, (2, 9, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>

For node 6:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
<6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (0, 7, 1)>, <6, (0, 9, 1)>

For node 7:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 7 as the center:
<7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
Therefore, there are 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center:
<8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16]. The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 9, 8)>, <1, (2, 9, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (0, 7, 1)>, <6, (0, 9, 1)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.
