Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph to visualize it better.  

The graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges can be illustrated as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars. 

The nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Node 1 has neighbors: [0, 3, 6]
Node 2 has neighbors: [3, 8] 
Node 3 has neighbors: [1, 2, 6, 7, 8]
Node 6 has neighbors: [1, 3, 7]
Node 7 has neighbors: [3, 6, 9]
Node 8 has neighbors: [2, 3, 5]

Now, applying the combination formula to these nodes, we find the total number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 13 \)

So, there are a total of 13 3-stars in the given graph.
These 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 8, -)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>
