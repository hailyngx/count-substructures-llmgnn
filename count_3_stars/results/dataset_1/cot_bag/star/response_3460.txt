Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to consider each node. Let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 10 + 1] = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (4, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (6, 5, 9)> 
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
