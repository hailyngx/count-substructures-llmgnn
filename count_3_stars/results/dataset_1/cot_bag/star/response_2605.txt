Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 7)

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 5, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of the identified nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars are: <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3, 5)>
