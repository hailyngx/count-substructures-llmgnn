Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
   0 --- 7       1 --- 6
   |     |       |     |
   8 --- 5 --- 2 --- 4
           |       |
           3       9
```

For this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars formed. 

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 5). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 2.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 8, 9, 2). Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 5.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7). Therefore, there is 1 3-star formed with node 6.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 9). Therefore, there is 1 3-star formed with node 8.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (5, 8) which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed with node 9.

Adding up the 3-stars formed with these nodes we get: \( 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>
