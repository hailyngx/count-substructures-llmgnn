Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's build the graph based on the provided information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 20 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) = 31.

Therefore, we can represent the 3-stars as:
[31]
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
