Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 8) = 6.
So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <1, (8, 9, 6)>
2. <5, (7, 6, 2)>
3. <8, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <8, (0, 6, 9)>
5. <8, (1, 9, 6)>
6. <8, (0, 1, 6)>
