Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: neighbors {7, 9}
Node 2: neighbors {5, 6, 7}
Node 3: neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9}
Node 5: neighbors {2, 3, 7}
Node 6: neighbors {2, 3, 7}
Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6}
Node 9: neighbors {0, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
Node 0: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
