Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
Node 0 has 3 neighbors. 
Node 3, 6, 8, and 9 each have 4 neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star 

For nodes 3, 6, 8, and 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each 

Adding them up: 1 + 4*4 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>
