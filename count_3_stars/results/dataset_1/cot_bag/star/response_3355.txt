Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8
- Node 5 is connected to node 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2
- Node 7 is connected to node 0
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9 is connected to node 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

There are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph. Putting this number inside brackets gives us our final answer: [5]

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
