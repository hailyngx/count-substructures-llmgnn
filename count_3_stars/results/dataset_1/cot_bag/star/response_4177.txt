Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 7). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 1: There are 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 8). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 1 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 3: There are 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 7, 9). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 3 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Node 4: There are 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 9). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 5: There are 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 7, 8, 9). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 5 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 7: There are 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 5, 8). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 7 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 8: There are 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 8 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 9: There are 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 5). So, the number of 3-stars formed from node 9 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
