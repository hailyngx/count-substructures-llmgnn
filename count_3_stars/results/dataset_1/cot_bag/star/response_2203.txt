Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's construct the 3-star graphs:

For node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8)
Since node 0 has 4 neighbors, it can form \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9)
Since node 4 has 4 neighbors, it can form \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
<4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7)
Since node 5 has 4 neighbors, it can form \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
<5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>

For all other nodes (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9), they either have less than 3 neighbors or exactly 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 4 + 4] = [12]

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>
