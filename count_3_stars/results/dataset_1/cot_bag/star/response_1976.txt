Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9. Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 14.

The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, and <9, (0, 2, 7)>.
