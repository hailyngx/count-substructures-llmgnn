Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (Exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Four 3-stars can be formed)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are:

<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
