Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Looking at the list of edges provided:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 2, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 36 3-stars in this graph, so the final result is [36].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>
