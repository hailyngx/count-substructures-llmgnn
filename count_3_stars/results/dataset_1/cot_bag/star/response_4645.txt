Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's see which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 8}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {0, 6, 7}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 8}
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {1, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 14

So, the total number of 3-stars is [14].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
