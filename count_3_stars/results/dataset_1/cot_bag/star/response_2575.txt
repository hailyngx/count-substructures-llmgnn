Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph with the given nodes and edges is illustrated as follows:

```plaintext
1 --- 3     7 --- 8
|\         /|     /|
| \       / |    / |
|  8     2  |   9  |
| /       \ |  /   |
|/         \| /    |
5 --- 3     2 --- 9
 \         /
  \       /
   4     6
```

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: It has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 8). There are 1 3-star: <1, (3, 8, 8)>

For node 2: It has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 9). There are 1 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 9)>

For node 3: It has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5). There are 1 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>

For node 4: It has 2 neighbors (6, 9). No 3-star can be formed.

For node 5: It has 1 neighbor (3). No 3-star can be formed.

For node 6: It has 1 neighbor (4). No 3-star can be formed.

For node 7: It has 2 neighbors (2, 8). No 3-star can be formed.

For node 8: It has 2 neighbors (1, 7). No 3-star can be formed.

For node 9: It has 2 neighbors (2, 4). No 3-star can be formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 8, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
