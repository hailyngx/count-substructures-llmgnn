Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (7, 6, 8)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 9)>,
<7, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (6, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (8, 3, 6)>.
