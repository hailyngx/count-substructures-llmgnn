Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6.
For node 0, the 3-stars formed are:
[1] <0, (1, 5, 6)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7.
For node 1, the 3-stars formed are:
[1] <1, (0, 4, 6)>

Node 4 has 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9.
For node 4, the 3-stars formed are:
[1] <4, (0, 1, 6)>
[1] <4, (1, 2, 8)>

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8.
For node 6, the 3-stars formed are:
[1] <6, (0, 3, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
