Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 20 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 9) = 36

Therefore, there are [36] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 9, 2)>
- <7, (9, 1, 2)>
