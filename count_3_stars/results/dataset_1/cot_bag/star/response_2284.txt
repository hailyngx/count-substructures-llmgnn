Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given information:

```
    0 -- 5 -- 8 -- 1
     \  /|     |   
      4 9     7--2
       \       /
         3----
```

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star formed with node 4.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors. There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 5: <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 = 5.

Therefore, the final result is [5] and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, and <4, (5, 7, 9)>.
