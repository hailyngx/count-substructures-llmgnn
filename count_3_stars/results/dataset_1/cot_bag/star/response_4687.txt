Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of [10 choose 3] = 120 ways to form a 3-star in this graph.

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3-stars = 4
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3-stars = 1

Adding these up, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (8, 9, 3)>

So, the final answer is [9].
