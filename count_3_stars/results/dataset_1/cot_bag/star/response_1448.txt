Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with less than 3 neighbours (nodes 10 and 2), 4 nodes with 3 neighbours (nodes 3, 6, 8, and 10), and 4 nodes with more than 3 neighbours (nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9).

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

For the nodes with more than 3 neighbors, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each:

For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (node 3) + 1 (node 6) + 1 (node 8) + 1 (node 10) + 10 (node 1) + 10 (node 4) + 1 (node 5) + 10 (node 9) = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found include: 
<3, (4, 3, 9)>
<6, (8, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 8, 6)>
<10, (4, 9, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 8, 6)>
<9, (4, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, 6)>
