Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are represented as pairs of nodes that are connected. 
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 42 \) 3-stars.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (4, 5, 3)>    

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].
