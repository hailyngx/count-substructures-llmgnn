Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors.

For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = \( [20 + 1] = 21 \)

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>
