Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5 
Node 2 has neighbors: 6, 8  
Node 3 has neighbors: 0  
Node 4 has neighbors: 9 
Node 5 has neighbors: 0  
Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 9  
Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 5: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1

Therefore, we have a total of [1] 3-star in this graph. The unique 3-star found is <3, (0, 5)>
