Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:  

```
    0 -- 1 -- 4 -- 8
    |    |    |    
    5 -- 2    9
    |         
    6 -- 3
```

There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 5. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 1:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 \).  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>
