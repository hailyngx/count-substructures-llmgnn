Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6), (5, 1), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 9), (8, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7)}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

So, the total number of 3-stars is [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
