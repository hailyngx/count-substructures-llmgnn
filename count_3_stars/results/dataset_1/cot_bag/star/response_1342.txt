Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
There are 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The edges are:
(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)
(1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8)
(2, 6), (2, 8)
(4, 9)
(5, 1), (5, 8)
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 9)
(7, 0), (7, 1)
(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5)
(9, 4), (9, 6)

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8) - forms 1 3-star
Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8) - forms 1 3-star
Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9) - forms 1 3-star

Total 3-stars: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>.
