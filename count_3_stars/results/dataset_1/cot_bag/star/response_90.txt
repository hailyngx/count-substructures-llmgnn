Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 6), (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 2), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 9. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9. Only 1 3-star can be formed with node 3.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9. No 3-star can be formed with node 5.

Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 9 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 53.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [53].
