Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {6, 7, 8}
Node 1: {6, 8}
Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
Node 4: {2, 6}
Node 5: {2, 8}
Node 6: {0, 1, 4}
Node 7: {0, 2}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5}
Node 9: {2, 3}

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes with three or more neighbors, we get:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up: 
\[ [1 + 10+ 4] = [15] \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
