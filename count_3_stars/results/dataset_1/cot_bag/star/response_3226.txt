Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To analyze this graph and find the total number of 3-stars, let's first identify the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0 -> Neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 -> Neighbors: 0, 3, 5
Node 2 -> Neighbors: 4, 9
Node 3 -> Neighbors: 0, 1
Node 4 -> Neighbors: 2, 6
Node 5 -> Neighbors: 1
Node 6 -> Neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 7 -> Neighbors: 0, 6, 9
Node 8 -> Neighbors: 0
Node 9 -> Neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 1: 0 (only 3 neighbors)
Node 2: 0 (only 2 neighbors)
Node 3: 0 (only 2 neighbors)
Node 4: 0 (only 2 neighbors)
Node 5: 0 (only 1 neighbor)
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 7: 0 (only 3 neighbors)
Node 8: 0 (only 1 neighbor)
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 = 28

So, there are 28 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>. 

Therefore, the final result is [28].
