Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
Let's analyze each node:

Node 0: Neighbors - 2, 5, 9
Node 1: Neighbors - 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 2: Neighbors - 0, 1, 6, 9
Node 4: Neighbors - 6, 7, 9
Node 5: Neighbors - 0, 1
Node 6: Neighbors - 1, 2, 4, 9
Node 7: Neighbor - 4
Node 8: Neighbor - 1
Node 9: Neighbors - 0, 2, 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 5 \]

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in this graph. Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: [5].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
