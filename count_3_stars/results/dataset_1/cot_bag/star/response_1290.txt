Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars they are part of:

Node 1:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 5
- Total 3-stars: C(3,3) = 1
  <1, (2, 3, 5)>

Node 2:
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 5
- Total 3-stars: C(3,3) = 1
  <2, (1, 3, 5)>

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Total 3-stars: C(3,3) = 1
  <3, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 5:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 6
- Total 3-stars: C(3,3) = 1
  <5, (1, 2, 6)>

Node 6:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Total 3-stars: C(4,3) = 4
  <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 6, 8
- Total 3-stars: C(2,3) = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 8.
