Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. 

Let's examine each node to see how many neighbors it has:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (4)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 2)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (2, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (8, 9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 7, 8)

Now, we can calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 23

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
