Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: There is only 1 3-star that can be formed with this node
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33 \).  

So, the final answer is [33].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
