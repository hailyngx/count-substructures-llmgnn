Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 4, 6, and 9. 

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44]. 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
