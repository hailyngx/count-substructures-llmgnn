Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Nodes 7 and 8 each have 1 neighbor, so they do not form any 3-star.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for the other nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, there are 19 3-stars in this graph. 

<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (2, 1, 3)>, <6, (2, 1, 9)>, <6, (3, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)> 
So, the final answer is [19].
