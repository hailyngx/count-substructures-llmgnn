Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 (6 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 3, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7 (4 neighbors)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 59 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>

- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
