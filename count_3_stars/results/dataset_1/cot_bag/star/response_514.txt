Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars around each such node. 

- Node 3: {(1, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (3, 7, 8), (3, 5, 9)} --> 4 3-stars
- Node 4: {(0, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 4, 6), (3, 4, 6), (4, 6, 9)} --> 5 3-stars
- Node 5: {(3, 5, 7), (5, 7, 8), (5, 8, 9)} --> 3 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (5, 8, 9)>
