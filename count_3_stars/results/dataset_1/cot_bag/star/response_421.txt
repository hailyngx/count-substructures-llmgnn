Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13 \).  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 4>
<3, 1, 0>
<3, 1, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 0, 7>
<7, 0, 4>
<7, 3, 4>
<7, 3, 1>
<7, 3, 9>
<7, 4, 0>
<7, 4, 2>
<7, 4, 5>
<7, 4, 2>    

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
