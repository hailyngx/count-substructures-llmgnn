Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually to better understand it:

```
    1 -- 2
     \    |
       3  |
         \|
    4 -- 6 -- 0 -- 7
           |    /
           9-- 8
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 9, 6)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 8, 9)

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 10] = [15] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 0, 9)>
- <6, (4, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>
- <9, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 8, 6)>
- <9, (1, 8, 6)>
