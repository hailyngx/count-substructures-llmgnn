Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will determine how many 3-stars are formed around each node that has three or more neighbors.

Let's first identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbor {4}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars each node can form:
- Node 6 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.

So, there are 5 total 3-stars in the graph which can be represented as:
\[ [5] \]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>
