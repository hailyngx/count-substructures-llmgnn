Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 8 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 1 neighbor
Node 5: 1 neighbor
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 6 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 56 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 85 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [85]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
