Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors. Let's list out the nodes and their respective neighbors:

Node 0: {5}
Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 5: {0, 3, 4}
Node 6: {2, 8}
Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 9: {3, 4, 8}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 6)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (6, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 3] = [6].
