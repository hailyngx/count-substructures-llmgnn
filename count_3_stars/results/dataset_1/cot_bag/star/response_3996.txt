Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {2, 5, 7}
Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 4: {2, 6}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 9}
Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 8}
Node 8: {1, 7, 9}
Node 9: {2, 5, 6, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
Node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
Node 2: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
Node 5: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
Node 9: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

Adding these up: $1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27$

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
