Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their adjacent neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 8}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

For Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
For Node 1: There are only 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For Node 8: There are only 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
For Node 9: There are only 3 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
