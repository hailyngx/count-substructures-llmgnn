Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 6), (3, 5), (3, 7), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8)]

To determine the number of 3-stars and their configurations, let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7.

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
    - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
    - <1, (0, 6, 5)>
    
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
    - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
    
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
    
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{1} = 3 \) 3-stars
    - <7, (0, 3, 6)>

In total, there are 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15 3-stars in this graph, represented as:

[15]

<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>
