Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 6 has neighbors [0, 4, 7]
- Node 1 has neighbors [7, 8]
- Node 3 has neighbors [7, 9]
- Node 5 has neighbors [8, 9]
- Node 8 has neighbors [1, 5, 9]
- Node 9 has neighbors [3, 5, 8]

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
