Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph: nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars for node 2 = 1 (1 combination)

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars for node 3 = 1 (1 combination)

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 9, and 4.
- Number of 3-stars for node 5 = 4 (4 combinations): <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars for node 6 = 4 (4 combinations): <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>.
