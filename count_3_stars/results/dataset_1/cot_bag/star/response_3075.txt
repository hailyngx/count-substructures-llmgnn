Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
```
    1 -- 5 -- 4 -- 8
         |    |    |
         6 -- 0 -- 9
              |    |
              7    3
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 8>
- <5, 0, 6>
- <5, 4, 8>
- <5, 6, 0>
- <6, 0, 9>
- <9, 0, 6>
- <9, 4, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <5, 9, 0>
- <5, 9, 6>
