Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Only nodes 2, 3, and 6 have three or more neighbors, which allows for the formation of 3-stars. 

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \).

Therefore, the answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
