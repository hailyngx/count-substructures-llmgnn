Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Thus, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes. 

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 5)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: nodes 3, 6, 9, and 2.
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>, <5, (3, 9, 2)>, <5, (6, 9, 2)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: nodes 1 and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of 3-stars formed around nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9: \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>, <5, (3, 9, 2)>, <5, (6, 9, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, and <9, (1, 5, 7)>.
