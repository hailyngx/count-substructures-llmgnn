Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: (1, 7, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 6)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: (0, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 6, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 1] = [16] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (0, 6, 9)>
