Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 52 \)

So, there are 52 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>
- <9, (2, 3, 8)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.
