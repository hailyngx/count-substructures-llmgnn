Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first check each node to see if it has three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node as the center node.

Here are the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors {2, 5, 6, 7}, forming 1 3-star with node 1 as the center.
- Node 2 has neighbors {1, 5, 8}, forming 1 3-star with node 2 as the center.
- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 3}, forming 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 2}, forming 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has neighbors {1, 7}, forming 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has neighbors {1, 6, 8}, forming 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has neighbors {2, 7}, forming 1 3-star with node 8 as the center.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 3-stars in the given graph, and we can represent them as follows:
[7]

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 8)>
