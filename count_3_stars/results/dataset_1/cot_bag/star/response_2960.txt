Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5, 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 2, 3

From this, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, hence have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 (Exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [1]

Unique 3-star found: <7, (1, 5, 6)>
