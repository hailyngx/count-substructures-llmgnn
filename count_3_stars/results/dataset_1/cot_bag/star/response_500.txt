Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Looking at the list of edges, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7 have 5 neighbors each.

For node 2:
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 5:
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>

Summing up the number of 3-stars: 5 + 5 + 1 + 5 = 16

Thus, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the graph.
