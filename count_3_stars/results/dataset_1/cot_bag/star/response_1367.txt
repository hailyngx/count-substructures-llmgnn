Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 14.

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (2, 6, 8)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 9)>
7. <8, (1, 2, 4)>
8. <9, (3, 4, 6)>

So, the final answer is [14].
