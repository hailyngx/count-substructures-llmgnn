Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23

So, the total number of 3-stars is [23], and the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
