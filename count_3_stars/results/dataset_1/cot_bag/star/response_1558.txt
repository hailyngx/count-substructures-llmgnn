Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to node 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to node 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to node 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 6 forms another 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms one more 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8: <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 9: <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 forms another 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 7, so the final answer is [7].
