Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are 0, 2, 4, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, there are 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 4. So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 2, there are 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 2 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 4, there are 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9. So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 8, there are 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. So, the number of 3-stars formed with node 8 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 20 + 10 + 20] = 51 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>.
