Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Each node has the following neighbors:
- Node 1: {3, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {3, 4}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 10: {}

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 1: C(2,3) = 1
- Node 2: C(2,3) = 1
- Node 3: C(5,3) = 10
- Node 4: C(4,3) = 4
- Node 5: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 8: C(3,3) = 1
- Node 9: C(3,3) = 1

The total number of 3-stars is: [1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 19

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
