Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 35 = 69 \)

So, the final count of 3-stars is [69].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
