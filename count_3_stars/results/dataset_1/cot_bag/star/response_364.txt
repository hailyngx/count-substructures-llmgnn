Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges:
- Nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (1, 7), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with its neighbors 6, 7, and 8.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
