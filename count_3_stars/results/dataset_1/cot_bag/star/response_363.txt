Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 1:
- There are \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) ways to form a 3-star.

For node 2:
- There are \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) ways to form a 3-star.

For nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9:
- Each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors, so they contribute 1 3-star each.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<5, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<8, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 5, 6)>.
