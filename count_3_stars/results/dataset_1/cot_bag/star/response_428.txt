Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5)
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   <0, (2, 3, 5)>

2. Node 2: has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 9)
   - inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
   <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, 
   <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>

3. Node 3: has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9)
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   <3, (0, 2, 9)>

4. Node 4: has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9)
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   <4, (2, 8, 9)>

5. Node 5: has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8)
   - inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
   <5, (0, 1, 8)>

6. Node 8: has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 9)
   - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
   <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

7. Node 9: has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 8)
   - inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
   <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 22.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>
