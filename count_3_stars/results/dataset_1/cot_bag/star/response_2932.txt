Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars and identify the unique ones:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
