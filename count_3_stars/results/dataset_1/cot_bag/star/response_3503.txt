Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1: Forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 6, 7 (3 3-stars).
- Node 2: Forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 5, 6 (3 3-stars).
- Node 6: Forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, 4 (3 3-stars).
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [3 + 3 + 3 + 1] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
