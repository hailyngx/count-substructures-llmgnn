Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 10 + 1 + 10] = 25 \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
