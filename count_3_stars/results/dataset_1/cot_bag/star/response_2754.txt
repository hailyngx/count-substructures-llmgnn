Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to determine the degree of each node by counting the number of edges incident to it:

Node 0: degree 2  
Node 1: degree 4  
Node 2: degree 1  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 6  
Node 8: degree 5  
Node 9: degree 2  

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Now summing up the number of 3-stars from each node:  
\( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 43 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
