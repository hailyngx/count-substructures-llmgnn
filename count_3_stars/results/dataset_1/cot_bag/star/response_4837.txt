Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up gives a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
