Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors 8, 9
- Node 1: neighbors 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: neighbor 1
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 6
- Node 4: neighbor 5
- Node 5: neighbors 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 3, 8
- Node 8: neighbors 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 9: neighbors 0, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so 4 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4] = 6

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 1, 8)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>

So the final answer is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 1, 8)>, <5, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>.
