Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 5, 6>
<4, 0, 7>
<4, 5, 8>
