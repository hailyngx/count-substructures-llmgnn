Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here is the list of such nodes along with their neighbors:
1. Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 8}
3. Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
4. Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
4. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 31
So, the final answer is [31].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
