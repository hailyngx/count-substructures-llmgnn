Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6)
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9)
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 8)
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6)
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5)

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

So, the final answer is [21].
