Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 20 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
