Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6  
Node 1: 0  
Node 2: 7, 8  
Node 3: 9  
Node 4: 0, 6, 7  
Node 5: 6, 9  
Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7  
Node 7: 2, 4, 6  
Node 8: 2  
Node 9: 3, 5  

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 can form 3-stars with (1, 6, 4) and (4, 6, 7) -> 2 3-stars
Node 2 can form 1 3-star with (7, 4, 6)
Node 4 can form 1 3-star with (6, 0, 7)
Node 6 can form 1 3-star with (0, 4, 7)  

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
