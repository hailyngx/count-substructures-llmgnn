Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 6, and 7.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (6, 4, 7)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
