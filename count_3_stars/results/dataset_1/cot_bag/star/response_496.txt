Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

We'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- For node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 16.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].
