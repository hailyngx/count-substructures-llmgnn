Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
   <0, (3, 4, 7)>

- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors (3, 5), which is less than 3.

- Node 3: It has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 7). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
   <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>,  
   <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
   <4, (0, 3, 5)>

- Node 5: It has 2 neighbors (1, 4), which is less than 3.

- Node 7: It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 9). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
   <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>

- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7). Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
   <9, (2, 3, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1] = [17].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>
