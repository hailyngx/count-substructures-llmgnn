Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {5, 6, 9}
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 9)>

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: {0, 6}
- Node 4 doesn't form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {2, 8, 9}
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <5, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {2, 4, 7}
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>

Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {6, 8}
- Node 7 doesn't form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 5}
- Number of 3-stars formed with node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph, denoted as [], is [7] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, and <6, (2, 4, 7)>.
