Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given in the format (node1, node2).

To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Node 5, 6, 7, and 9 satisfy this condition. 

For node 5:
- (0, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7)
This node has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

For node 6:
- (0, 6), (1, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 7)
This node has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

For node 7:
- (0, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (9, 7)
This node has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

For node 9:
- (1, 9), (2, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 7)
This node has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40.

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)> 

Thus, the final count of unique 3-stars is [27].
