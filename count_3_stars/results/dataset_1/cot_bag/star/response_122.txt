Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 2}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {6}

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>
