Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 5  
Node 1: 3  
Node 2: 4, 9  
Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8  
Node 4: 2, 5   
Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 9  
Node 6: 3, 7  
Node 7: 3, 5, 6  
Node 8: 3  
Node 9: 2, 5  

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:

For node 0: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)  
For node 1: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)  
For node 2: 1 3-star  
For node 3: 1 3-star  
For node 4: 1 3-star  
For node 5: 1 3-star  
For node 6: 1 3-star  
For node 7: 2 3-stars  
For node 8: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)  
For node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = 6.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, 4, 5>  
<3, 6, 7>  
<3, 5, 7>
