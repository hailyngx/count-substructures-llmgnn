Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the unique 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we'll count the number of 3-stars originating from that node.

The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
