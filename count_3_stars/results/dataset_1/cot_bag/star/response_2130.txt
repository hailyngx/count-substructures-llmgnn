Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<1, 0, 4>
<4, 1, 8>
<4, 1, 9>
<4, 0, 8>
<4, 0, 9>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 8, 4>
<9, 0, 4>
<9, 8, 0>
