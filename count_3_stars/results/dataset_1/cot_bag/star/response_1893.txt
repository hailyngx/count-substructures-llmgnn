Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

For each of these nodes, we will count the number of 3-star configurations:

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: $1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>
