Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9).
  Number of 3-stars formed with node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  3-stars: <0, (3, 8, 9)>

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
  No 3-stars formed with node 1.

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 8, 9).
  Number of 3-stars formed with node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9).
  Number of 3-stars formed with node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  3-stars: <4, (3, 8, 9)>

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9).
  Number of 3-stars formed with node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  3-stars: <7, (1, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 has 6 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9).
  Number of 3-stars formed with node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>

- Node 9 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8).
  Number of 3-stars formed with node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20] = [47]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 47.
