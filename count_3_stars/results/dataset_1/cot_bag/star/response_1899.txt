Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 8), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6), so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 7), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (7, 8), so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 25. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 8, 9)>.
