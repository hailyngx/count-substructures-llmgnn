Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6
- Node 2 is connected to node 3
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0: forms 1 3-star
- Node 3: forms 1 3-star
- Node 4: forms 1 3-star
- Node 5: forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: forms 1 3-star

Putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets [], we have [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
