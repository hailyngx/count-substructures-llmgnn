Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9: 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 63 \)

So, the total number of unique 3-stars is [63]. Here are the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
