Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 14 edges, let's construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 3
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 2, 4
- Node 4 is connected to Node 3
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 6, 9
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 5, 7
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 6, 9
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 5, 7

Now we can determine the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

So, there are no 3-stars in this graph, and the total number of 3-stars is [0].
