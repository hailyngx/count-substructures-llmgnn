Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 1: neighbors 0, 7, 1
Node 3: neighbors 4, 5, 8
Node 7: neighbors 1, 8, 1
Node 8: neighbors 3, 7, 3

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

So, the final answer is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 0, 7>
<3, 4, 5>
<7, 1, 8>
<8, 3, 7>
