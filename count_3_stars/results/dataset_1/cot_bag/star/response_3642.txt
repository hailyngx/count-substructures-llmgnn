Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze the nodes and their neighbors. Here is a summary of the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 7} (Degree = 4)
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8, 9} (Degree = 4)
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 5, 7, 9} (Degree = 4)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 5, 6} (Degree = 3)
- Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8} (Degree = 3)
- Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 3} (Degree = 2)
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3} (Degree = 1)
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4} (Degree = 3)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 4} (Degree = 2)
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2} (Degree = 2)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- No 3-stars are formed by nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 since they have less than 3 neighbors 
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14 \].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
