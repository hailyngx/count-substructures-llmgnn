Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9
  For node 0, there are 4 ways to form 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
  For node 1, there are 20 ways to form 3-stars: [6 choose 3] = 20

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 9
  Node 2 cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 0
  For node 4, there are 4 ways to form 3-stars: [4 choose 3] = 4

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9
  For node 5, there are 10 ways to form 3-stars: [5 choose 3] = 10

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 8
  Node 7 cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 9
  Node 8 cannot form any 3-stars.

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8
  For node 9, there are 10 ways to form 3-stars: [5 choose 3] = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [48]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
