Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6. So, it can form 1 3-star.
3-star: <0, (2, 5, 6)>

Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
3-star: <3, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.
3-star: <5, (0, 3, 8)>

Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
3-star: <8, (3, 4, 5)>

Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

There is a total of 5 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [5].
