Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0:
It has 2 neighbors (1 and 8), which is less than 3.

For node 1:
It has 2 neighbors (2 and 7), which is less than 3.

For node 2:
It has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, and 9). So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars formed with node 2:
<2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>.

For node 3:
It has 3 neighbors (6, 8, and 9). There is 1 3-star formed with node 3:
<3, (6, 8, 9)>.

For node 4:
It has 2 neighbors (5 and 7), which is less than 3.

For node 5:
It has 2 neighbors (4 and 6), which is less than 3.

For node 6:
It has 3 neighbors (3, 5, and 7). There is 1 3-star formed with node 6:
<6, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 7:
It has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, and 9). So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars formed with node 7:
<7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>.

For node 8:
It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, and 3). There is 1 3-star formed with node 8:
<8, (0, 2, 3)>.

For node 9:
It has 3 neighbors (2, 3, and 7). There is 1 3-star formed with node 9:
<9, (2, 3, 7)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is $4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10$. Therefore, the answer is [10].
