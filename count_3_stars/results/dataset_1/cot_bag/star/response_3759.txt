Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11

So, there are 11 3-stars in this graph.
Putting the final number inside brackets: [11]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 4)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 0, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>
