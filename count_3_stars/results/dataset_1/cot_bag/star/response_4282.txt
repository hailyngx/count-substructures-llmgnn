Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
