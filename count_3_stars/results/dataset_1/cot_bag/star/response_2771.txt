Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 6.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 9.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star
    - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
    - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <3, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1 3-star
    - <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
    - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <5, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <5, (0, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars
    - <9, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <9, (5, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 14. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>.
