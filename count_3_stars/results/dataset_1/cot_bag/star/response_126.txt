Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43. So, the total number of 3-stars is [43].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
