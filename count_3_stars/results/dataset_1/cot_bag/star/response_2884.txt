Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have at least three neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, a total of 3-stars is \( [1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1] = [2] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>.
