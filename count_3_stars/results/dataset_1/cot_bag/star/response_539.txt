Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
