Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: [\({{2}\choose{3}}\)] = 0
Node 1: [\({{4}\choose{3}}\)] = 4
Node 2: [\({{4}\choose{3}}\)] = 4
Node 3: [\({{3}\choose{3}}\)] = 1
Node 5: [\({{3}\choose{3}}\)] = 1
Node 7: [\({{4}\choose{3}}\)] = 4
Node 9: [\({{4}\choose{3}}\)] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 18

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 7, 6)>
