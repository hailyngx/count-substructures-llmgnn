Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph by listing its nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>
