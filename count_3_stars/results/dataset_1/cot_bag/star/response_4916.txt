Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, not enough for a 3-star
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. <4, (2, 5, 8)>
3. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
4. <4, (7, 8, 9)>
5. <5, (4, 8, 9)>
6. <7, (0, 1, 4)>
7. <7, (4, 9, 0)>
8. <7, (9, 0, 1)>
9. <7, (9, 4, 0)>
10. <9, (0, 3, 6)>
11. <9, (0, 5, 3)>
12. <9, (3, 6, 0)>
13. <9, (5, 0, 3)>
14. <9, (6, 0, 3)>
15. <9, (6, 0, 5)>
16. <9, (7, 0, 1)>
17. <9, (7, 0, 4)>
18. <9, (7, 0, 5)>
19. <9, (7, 1, 4)>
20. <9, (7, 4, 0)>
