Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (1, 8)
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (3, 7)
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 9)
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor (5)

Nodes 5 and 2 have 4 and 3 neighbors, respectively. We can form 4 3-stars around node 5 and 3 3-stars around node 2. Nodes 0 and 8 have exactly 2 neighbors each, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 3 = 7, and we represent them as follows:

[7]
<5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 2)>, <2, (3, 7, 2)>, <2, (3, 7, 2)>
