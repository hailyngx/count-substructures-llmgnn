Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes can be labeled as follows:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
Node 3 is connected to node 4.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
Node 5 is connected to node 9.
Node 6 is connected to node 7.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
Node 8 is connected to node 4.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <4, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
