Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are three nodes with exactly three neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 4.

For node 1:
There are three edges connected to node 1, forming a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 3, 5, and 7 as leaves. So, there is 1 unique 3-star with node 1.

For node 2:
There are four edges connected to node 2, forming a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 5, 6, and 7 as leaves. So, there is 1 unique 3-star with node 2.

For node 4:
There are three edges connected to node 4, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 3, 6, and 9 as leaves. So, there is 1 unique 3-star with node 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which can be represented as [3].

The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, and <4, (3, 6, 9)>.
