Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Applying the method explained, we will look at each node in the graph to determine the total number of 3-stars it is a part of.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 5. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 8. There is 1 3-star formed with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 4, 8)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 2. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 9. There is 1 3-star formed with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 6, 9)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5 and 7. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 6. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 3. There is 1 3-star formed with node 8 as the center: <8, (0, 2, 3)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 5. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2, and they are:
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>

Putting this final count inside brackets [] gives [2].
