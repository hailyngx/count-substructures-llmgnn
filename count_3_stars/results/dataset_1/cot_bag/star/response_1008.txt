Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 1, 2
- Node 9: 0, 2

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it also contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 = 8, so we'll write this as [8].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
