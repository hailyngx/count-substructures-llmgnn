Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star. <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars. <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star. <7, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
