Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 42 3-stars. So, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
