Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0, since it has 4 neighbors, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 2 and node 8, with 4 neighbors each, there are also 4 3-stars for each.
For nodes 3, 4, and 7, with 3 neighbors each, there is only 1 3-star for each.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>.
