Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's now identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (5, 6)
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8), so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8), so it forms 1 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 8, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars: <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors (1, 2)
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 8, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors (0, 8)
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 9), so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>
9. Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5), so it forms 4 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7), so it forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 19.
