Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

We can see that nodes 2, 3, and 6 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

Node 2:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Number of 3-stars = 10

Node 3:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 3 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Number of 3-stars = 1

Node 6:
- Number of ways to choose 3 neighbors from 7 = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Number of 3-stars = 35

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 35 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (6, 8, 9)>
