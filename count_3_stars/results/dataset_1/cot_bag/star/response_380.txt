Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we can start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Node 3, 4, 5, 6 have at least three neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

For Node 3:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>
  
For Node 4:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars)

For Node 5:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars)

For Node 6:
- 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 8

So, the final answer is [8] with the unique 3-stars being <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>.
