Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 8.
Number of 3-stars involving node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (1, 2, 8)>

For node 1:
There are 2 neighbors: 0 and 6.
No 3-star can be formed with node 1 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 6.
Number of 3-stars involving node 2 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>

For node 3:
There are 3 neighbors: 2, 7, and 9.
Number of 3-stars involving node 3 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<3, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 6:
There are 2 neighbors: 1 and 2.
No 3-star can be formed with node 6 as it has less than 3 neighbors.

There is only one 3-star in the graph since the 3-stars formed by different nodes do not overlap. 

Putting this final number inside brackets [], we get: [6]
