Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9. 
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 18.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

The final result is [18].
