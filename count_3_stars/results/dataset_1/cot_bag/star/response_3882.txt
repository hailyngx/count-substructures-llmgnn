Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, correct?

Analyzing the degrees of each node:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 0 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [18] \)

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 1)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>
