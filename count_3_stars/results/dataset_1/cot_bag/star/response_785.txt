Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To start, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 7 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 all have fewer than 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [35 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [53] \).

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
