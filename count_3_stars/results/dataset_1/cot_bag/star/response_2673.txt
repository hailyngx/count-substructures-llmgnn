Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 7). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5, 7). Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: (0, 3). As it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 8, 9). Therefore, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 7) = 9. So the answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 1)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
