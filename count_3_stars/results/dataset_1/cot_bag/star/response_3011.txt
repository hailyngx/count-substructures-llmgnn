Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can construct the following visualization:

```
  0 ----- 4 ----- 2
  |       |       |
  |       |       |
  9 ----- 1       5
          |       |
          6       |
          |       |
          8 ----- 7
```

Since the center of a 3-star graph needs to have exactly 3 neighbors, we can see that nodes 4 and 8 qualify as centers as they have 5 neighbors each. 
For node 4, the 3-stars are: 
- <4, (0, 9, 2)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
For node 8, the 3-stars are:
- <8, (5, 7, 4)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars according to the method described earlier:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 = 20 \]

Thus, the final answer is [20].
