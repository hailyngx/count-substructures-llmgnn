Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are \( \binom{10}{3} = 120 \) possible 3-stars that can be formed in this graph. 

Let's now identify the unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
3. <0, (5, 4, 8)>
4. <0, (5, 4, 9)>
5. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
6. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
7. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
8. <3, (4, 6, 8)>
9. <3, (4, 6, 9)>
10. <7, (5, 8, 9)>
11. <8, (0, 4, 9)>
12. <8, (4, 6, 9)>
13. <9, (0, 4, 8)>
14. <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
