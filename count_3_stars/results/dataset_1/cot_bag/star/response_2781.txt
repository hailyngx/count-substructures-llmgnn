Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has 8 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars is: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 56 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 95 \)

Therefore, there are 95 3-stars in the given graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<[0, 2, 3], [1, 3, 7], [3, 5, 7], [3, 6, 9], [3, 7, 9], [5, 7, 9]> 

So, the final answer is [95].
