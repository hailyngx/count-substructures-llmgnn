Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Adding up all the 3-stars calculated: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are 15 3-stars in the given graph: [15].
