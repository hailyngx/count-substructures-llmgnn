Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {1}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {0}
- Node 9: {0, 5}

Now let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 can form 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
Node 1 can form 1 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
Node 2 can't form any 3-star.
Node 3 can't form any 3-star.
Node 4 can't form any 3-star.
Node 5 can form 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>
Node 6 can form 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 1)>, <6, (0, 5, 3)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>
Node 7 can't form any 3-star.
Node 8 can't form any 3-star.
Node 9 can't form any 3-star.

Since there are a total of 13 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [13].
