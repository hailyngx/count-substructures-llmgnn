Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 1, 7
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 2
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For nodes 0, 1, 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each
- For nodes 4, 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for each

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 32 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [32]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>.
