Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 8
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 6
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9: Connected to node 5

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 9: inom{0}{3} = 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 2
So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 7, 8)> and <8, (0, 2, 6)>.
