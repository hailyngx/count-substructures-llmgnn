Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Here is the list of 3-stars and the number of occurrences:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: (0, 3, 9) and (0, 6, 8)
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with the following sets of nodes: (1, 4, 2) and (1, 7, 5)
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 5)
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars with nodes (3, 0, 9) and (3, 9, 2)
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with nodes (4, 1, 2)
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with nodes (5, 7, 8)
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star with nodes (6, 0, 8)
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star with nodes (7, 1, 5)
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with nodes (8, 6, 5)
- Node 9 forms 2 3-stars with nodes (9, 3, 0) and (9, 2, 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is `[2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2] = 12`.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (3, 9, 0)>, <0, (6, 8, 0)>, <1, (4, 2, 1)>, <1, (7, 5, 1)>, <2, (4, 5, 2)>, <3, (9, 0, 3)>, <3, (2, 9, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (8, 0, 6)>, <7, (5, 1, 7)>, <8, (6, 5, 8)>
