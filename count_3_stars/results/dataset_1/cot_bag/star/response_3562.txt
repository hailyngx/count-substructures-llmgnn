Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 4)
(1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 9)
(2, 4), (2, 8)
(3, 9)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7)
(5, 6)
(6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7)
(7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9)
(8, 2), (8, 7)
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph using the given method:
- Node 1 and Node 9 each have 3 neighbors, so they form 1 3-star each.
- Node 4 and Node 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they form 4 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [10]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
