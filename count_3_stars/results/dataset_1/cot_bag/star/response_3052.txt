Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:  
0: 9  
1: 2  
2: 1, 3, 7, 9  
3: 2, 6  
4: 8  
5: 6, 7  
6: 3, 5, 8  
7: 2, 5, 8  
8: 4, 6, 7  
9: 0, 2  

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars.  
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Thus, we have a total of 6 3-stars.  

Inside brackets [], we write the total number of 3-stars: [6]  
Now, listing the unique 3-stars inside <>:  
<2, (1, 3, 7)>  
<2, (1, 9, 7)>  
<2, (3, 7, 9)>  
<6, (3, 5, 8)>  
<8, (4, 7, 6)>  
<8, (6, 7, 5)>
