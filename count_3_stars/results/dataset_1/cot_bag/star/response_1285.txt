Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, with the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.

Looking at the connections, we see that nodes 5, 4, 9, and 8 have three or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

For node 5:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 4), so we have <5, (0, 2, 4)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 4, 7), giving us <5, (2, 4, 7)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 6, 9), yielding <4, (5, 6, 9)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 4, 8), leading to <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 6, 9), resulting in <8, (1, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, and <9, (3, 4, 8)>, and <8, (1, 6, 9)>.
