Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 4 and 6. 

For node 4:
There are 3 choose 2 = 3 3-stars formed with node 4 as the center: 
<4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
There are 3 choose 2 = 3 3-stars formed with node 6 as the center:
<6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>.
