Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To start, let's list the adjacent nodes for each node:

Node 0: 7
Node 1: 3, 7, 9
Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 3, 8
Node 6: 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 6, 8
Node 8: 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up:
1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
