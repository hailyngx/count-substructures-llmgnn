Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the node degrees:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 1

Nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives us a total of 23 3-stars: 

\[ [23] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 8, 2>
- <0, 8, 3>
- <0, 8, 5>
- <0, 8, 7>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 8, 2>
- <1, 8, 5>
- <1, 8, 7>
- <7, 2, 8>
- <7, 4, 8>
- <7, 8, 5>
- <8, 1, 0>
- <8, 1, 3>
- <8, 1, 5>
- <8, 1, 7>
- <8, 2, 7>
- <8, 5, 6>
- <8, 5, 0>
- <8, 5, 1>
- <8, 5, 7>
- <8, 7, 0>
- <8, 7, 1>
