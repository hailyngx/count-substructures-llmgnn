Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 4: 5 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 1 neighbor
Node 7: 5 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, we'll count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
