Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are represented as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 9. Thus, it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 7, 9)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4. Thus, it forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
