Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \(10 + 4 + 10 = 24\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
