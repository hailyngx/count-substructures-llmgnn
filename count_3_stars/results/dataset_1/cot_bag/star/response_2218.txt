Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {6}
- Node 1: neighbors {5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {1}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 2}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4] = [6] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
