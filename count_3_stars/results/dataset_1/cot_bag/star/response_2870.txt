Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 (Degree: 6)
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9 (Degree: 5)
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 (Degree: 5)
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6 (Degree: 3)
- Node 4: 1, 9 (Degree: 2)
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5 (Degree: 4)
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 8: 2, 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 (Degree: 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 68

This gives us a total of [68] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
