Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4
- Node 6: 0, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 6
- Node 9: 4, 6

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6. So, 1 3-star.
Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, 7 and 2, 7, 9. So, 2 3-stars.
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7 and 9. So, 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 9)>
