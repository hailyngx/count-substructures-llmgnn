Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to look for nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form.

Let's examine each node:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9). It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9). It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9). It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with three or more neighbors, we get 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 20 3-stars in total.

So the final answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (3, 2, 9)>, <6, (6, 0, 4)>, <6, (6, 0, 5)>, <6, (6, 0, 7)>, <6, (6, 4, 5)>, <6, (6, 4, 7)>, <6, (6, 5, 7)>, <7, (7, 1, 3)>, <7, (7, 1, 6)>, <7, (7, 1, 8)>, <7, (7, 1, 9)>, <7, (7, 3, 6)>, <7, (7, 3, 8)>, <7, (7, 3, 9)>, <7, (7, 6, 8)>, <7, (7, 6, 9)>, <7, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (9, 0, 2)>, <9, (9, 0, 3)>, <9, (9, 0, 7)>, <9, (9, 2, 3)>, <9, (9, 2, 7)>, <9, (9, 3, 7)>.
