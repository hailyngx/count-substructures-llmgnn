Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
- 0 is connected to 4 and 9
- 1 is connected to 2, 5, and 9
- 2 is connected to 1, 4, and 5
- 4 is connected to 0, 2, 5, and 7
- 5 is connected to 1, 2, 4, and 6
- 6 is connected to 5 and 7
- 7 is connected to 4 and 6
- 8 is connected to 9
- 9 is connected to 0, 1, and 8

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: It has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star.
For node 1: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 2: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
For node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
For node 6: It has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star.
For node 7: It has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star.
For node 8: It has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3, so no 3-star.
For node 9: It has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 1)>
<9, (8, 1, 2)>
