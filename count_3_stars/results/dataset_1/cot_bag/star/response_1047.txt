Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 2)

Looking at the nodes and their neighbors, we can identify the following 3-stars:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [3]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: [0]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 1 + 0] = [8]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 8. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>
