Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

So we have a total of 6 3-stars: [6].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 4)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>.
