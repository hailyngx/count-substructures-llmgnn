Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 9} (degree 3)
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 7, 9} (degree 4)
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 8, 9} (degree 3)
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 7, 8} (degree 3)
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 5} (degree 3)
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6} (degree 5)

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
