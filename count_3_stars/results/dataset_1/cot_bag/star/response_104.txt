Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 6

We need to find the number of 3-stars. Let's go through each node that has three or more neighbors:

For node 0: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>
For node 1: There are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars = <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, and so on
For node 3: There are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars = <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, and so on
For node 5: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 3, 8)>
For node 6: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>
For node 7: There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars = <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>
For node 8: There are 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars = <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 1)>, and so on
For node 9: There are 1 choose 3 = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up all the 3-stars from the above calculation gives a total number of 3-stars as [84].
These 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 1)>, <8, (7, 1, 0)>, <8, (1, 0, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 6)>
