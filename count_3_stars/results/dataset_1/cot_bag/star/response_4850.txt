Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 22

So, there are a total of 22 unique 3-stars: 
<[0, 3, 4], [0, 3, 5], [0, 4, 6], [0, 5, 7], [0, 6, 7], [0, 6, 4], [0, 6, 7], [3, 0, 5], [3, 0, 9], [4, 0, 6], [5, 0, 7], [6, 0, 1], [6, 0, 2], [6, 4, 8], [7, 0, 5], [7, 0, 9], [3, 5, 7], [4, 8, 9], [9, 3, 7], [9, 3, 8], [9, 7, 8], [9, 7, 4]> 

Therefore, the final answer is [22].
