Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1, node 2, and node 5. We will calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 1:
There are 5 neighbors of node 1, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 1.

For node 2:
There are 5 neighbors of node 2, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 2.

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors of node 5, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars around node 5.

Putting these together, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 10 + 4] = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
