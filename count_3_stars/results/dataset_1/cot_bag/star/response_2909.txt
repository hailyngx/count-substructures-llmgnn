Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms any 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6} => Forms 1 3-star
2. Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 8} => Forms 1 3-star
3. Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 7} => Forms 1 3-star
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 7} => Forms 1 3-star
5. Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5} => Forms 1 3-star
6. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 8} => Forms 1 3-star
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 3} => Forms 1 3-star
8. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 9} => Forms 1 3-star
9. Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5} => Does not form any 3-stars
10. Node 9: Neighbors {7} => Does not form any 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
