Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 1: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 2: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 4: 
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 5: 
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 7: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For Node 9: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Adding these up:
\[ 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 25 \]

So, there are 25 total 3-stars in this graph. Listing them in unique form:

\[ [25] \]
 
Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (4, 5, 9)>
