Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.
From the given information, nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: No 3-star (as it has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 6\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
