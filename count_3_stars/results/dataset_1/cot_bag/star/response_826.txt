Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (Node 7)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (Nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (Nodes 1, 5, 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (Nodes 5, 8)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 3, 6)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (Nodes 1, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (Nodes 0, 1, 4, 6)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (Nodes 2, 3, 4)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (Node 1)

Calculating the number of 3-stars based on the number of neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 23 \)

So, the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>.
