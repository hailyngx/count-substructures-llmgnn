Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's identify the central nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 28 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [28].

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (6, 7, 9)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
5. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
8. <6, (2, 4, 7)>
9. <6, (2, 5, 7)>
10. <6, (4, 5, 7)>
11. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
12. <8, (0, 1, 3)>
13. <8, (0, 1, 5)>
14. <8, (0, 3, 5)>
15. <8, (1, 3, 5)>
