Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [20].

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
