Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 27 \)
So, [27].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (4, 8, 9)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>
