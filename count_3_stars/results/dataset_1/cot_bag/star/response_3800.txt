Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each node that has at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding up the number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are 18 3-stars in this graph.
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
