Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars is calculated as follows:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 all have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is given as [19]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 8, 9)>
