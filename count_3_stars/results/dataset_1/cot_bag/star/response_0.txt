Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Therefore, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 4 = 14 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
