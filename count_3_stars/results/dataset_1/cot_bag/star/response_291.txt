Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows: 
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1

Calculating the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [???]
- Node 1: [???]
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 3: [???]
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: [???]
- Node 6: [???]
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: [???]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [???]
