Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's organize the graph with its nodes and edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7.

Now let's find the 3-stars:

For node 4: [3-stars formed with node 4 = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)]
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 9: [3-stars formed with node 9 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)]
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars is [10 + 4 = 14].
