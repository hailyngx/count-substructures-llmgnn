Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 0, node 3, and node 4. 

For node 0:
Total 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (0, 1, 7)>

For node 4:
Total 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (0, 1, 6)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [20 + 4 + 10 = 34]

So, the final answer is [34].
