Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the information provided:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 18 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
