Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 forms 3 3-stars. <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars. <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star. <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
  
Adding these up, we have a total of [9] 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>
