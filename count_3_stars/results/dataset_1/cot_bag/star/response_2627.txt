Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to check each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \({5 \choose 3}\) = 10 3-stars. 
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars. 
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4 3-stars. 
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 20 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
 
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 6)>
<2, (3, 1, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
