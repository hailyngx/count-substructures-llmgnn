Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will follow the steps outlined in the introduction.

First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
