Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's identify each node's neighbors:

- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [0]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [2, 3, 4]
- Node 7: [1, 2]
- Node 8: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
- Node 9: [1, 2]

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 37 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [37].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 7, 6>
- <1, 8, 6>
- <4, 7, 6>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <4, 8, 6>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <1, 5, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>
- <8, 6, 9>
