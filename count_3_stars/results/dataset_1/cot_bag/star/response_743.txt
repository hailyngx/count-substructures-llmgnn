Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visually represented as follows:
```
0 -- 2
|    |
4 -- 8
|    |
5    9
|
1
|
7 -- 6
|
3
```

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (7, 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (7, 9)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (0, 8)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 0)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (3, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 3, 0)>
- <7, (1, 6, 0)>
- <7, (3, 6, 0)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
