Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: There is only 1 3-star formed with node 5
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have:
\( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 27 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 4, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 9, 8)>
- <4, (9, 1, 8)>
- <4, (9, 8, 7)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <8, (5, 1, 3)>
- <8, (7, 3, 5)>
- <8, (7, 5, 3)>
- <8, (9, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 1, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
