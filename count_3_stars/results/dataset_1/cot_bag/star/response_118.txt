Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 5}
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: [1]

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {0, 4, 7, 8}
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: [1]

Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {0, 4}

Node 3 has 1 neighbor: {5}

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: [1]

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: [1]

Node 6 has 2 neighbors: {4, 5}

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 8}

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 5, 7, 9}

Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {4, 8}

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [4]

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>
