Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of those nodes.

Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: Neighbors - 3, 6, 7 (degree = 3)
Node 1: Neighbors - 4, 5, 7, 8 (degree = 4)
Node 5: Neighbors - 1, 4, 6, 8 (degree = 4)
Node 6: Neighbors - 0, 3, 5 (degree = 3)
Node 8: Neighbors - 1, 5, 9 (degree = 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose three neighbors. So, only 1 3-star is formed at Node 0.
- Node 1:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose three neighbors. So, 4 3-stars are formed at Node 1.
- Node 5:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 ways to choose three neighbors. So, 4 3-stars are formed at Node 5.
- Node 6:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose three neighbors. So, only 1 3-star is formed at Node 6.
- Node 8:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 way to choose three neighbors. So, only 1 3-star is formed at Node 8.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
