Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. 

Node 2: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
<2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>

Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. 
<3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>

Node 4: It has 3 neighbors, so we can form 1 3-star with node 4 as the center. 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>

Node 6: It has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center. 
<6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 4)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 4)>

Node 8: It has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center. 
<8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 4)>, <8, (4, 6, 3)>, <8, (6, 3, 4)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 23 3-stars:
