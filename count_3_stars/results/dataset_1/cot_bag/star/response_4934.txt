Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>.
