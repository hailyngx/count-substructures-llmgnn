Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 8)

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 10 = 20.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].
