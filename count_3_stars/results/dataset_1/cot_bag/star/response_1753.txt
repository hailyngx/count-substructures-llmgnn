Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 7)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 14 3-stars: [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>
