Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, and 8. Applying the combination formula, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed with node 0.
   
2. Node 1: Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 9. \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed with node 1.
   
3. Node 2: Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 7 (less than 3 neighbors).

4. Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, and 9. \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star is formed with node 5.

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 5) = 3.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>
