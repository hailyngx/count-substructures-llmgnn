Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  <1, (0, 6, 8)>

- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 7)>

- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
  <6, (1, 2, 3)>

- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
  <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 14. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>,
<1, (0, 6, 8)>,
<2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 9, 7)>,
<6, (1, 2, 3)>,
<8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>
