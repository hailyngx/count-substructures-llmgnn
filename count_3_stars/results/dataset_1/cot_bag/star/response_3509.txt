Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are denoted as {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 9}
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 6}
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {2, 5, 8}
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 6}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 8}
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {3, 6, 9}
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {1, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].
