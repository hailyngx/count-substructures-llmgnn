Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be described as follows:

0: 2, 4, 7, 9
1: 2, 6, 7, 9
2: 0, 1, 7, 8
3: 6
4: 0, 6
6: 1, 3, 4, 9
7: 0, 1, 2
8: 2
9: 0, 1, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars: 
Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Thus, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
