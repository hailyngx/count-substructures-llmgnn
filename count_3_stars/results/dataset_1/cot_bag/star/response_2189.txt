Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), 
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 3), 
(6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 7), (9, 2)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6) -> One unique 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
For node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6) -> One unique 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7) -> One unique 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
For node 6: (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 7) -> One unique 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 7)>
For node 7: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8) -> One unique 3-star: <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, which we represent as [4].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, and <6, (0, 3, 7)>.
