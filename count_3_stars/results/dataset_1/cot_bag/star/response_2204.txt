Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Node 0: Connected to nodes 1 and 2 (2 neighbors)
Node 1: Connected to nodes 0 and 9 (2 neighbors)
Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5 (2 neighbors)
Node 3: Connected to node 7 (1 neighbor)
Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 6: Connected to node 5 (1 neighbor)
Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 5 (2 neighbors)
Node 8: Connected to node 5 (1 neighbor)
Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 5 (2 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
