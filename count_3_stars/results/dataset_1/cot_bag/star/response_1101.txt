Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9 and the edges are listed as provided. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 5.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 8.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, and 9.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 7.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2, which we put inside brackets [].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <4, (2, 3, 7)> and <5, (0, 6, 7)>.
