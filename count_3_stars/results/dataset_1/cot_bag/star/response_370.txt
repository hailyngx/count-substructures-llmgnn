Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {4, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 4}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 6}

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node having 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10

So, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-star configurations are <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, and <6, (5, 4, 9)>.
