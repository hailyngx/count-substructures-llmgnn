Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3-stars formed = inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: 3-stars formed = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: 3-stars formed = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars formed = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: 3-stars formed = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: 3-stars formed = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars formed = inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars formed = inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars: [0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [13]
