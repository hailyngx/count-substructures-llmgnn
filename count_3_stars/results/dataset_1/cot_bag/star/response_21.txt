Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are four nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9

So, the final result is [9].
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, 7)>
<3, (4, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
