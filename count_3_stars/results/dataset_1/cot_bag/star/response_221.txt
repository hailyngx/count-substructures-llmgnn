Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Total number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 9
- Total number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 4, 7
- Since node 3 has fewer than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 6, 9
- Since node 5 has fewer than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
- Since node 6 has fewer than 3 neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9
- Total number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center: inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Total number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>.
