Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (forming 1 3-star).
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we find the total number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

So, there are [5] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
