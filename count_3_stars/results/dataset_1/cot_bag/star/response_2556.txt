Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and edges can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
