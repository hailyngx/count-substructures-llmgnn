Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we first need to identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors. 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8)
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8)
Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9)
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 8)
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 9)
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 8)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 4, 8)>
<1, (7, 2, 8)>
<(2, 1, 4), 8>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<(8, 1, 7), 4>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<(1, 4, 8), 7>
<(1, 7, 4), 8>
<(1, 7, 8), 4>
<(4, 1, 7), 8>
<(4, 1, 8), 7>
<(7, 1, 4), 8>
