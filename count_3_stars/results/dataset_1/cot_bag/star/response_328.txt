Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors.

For each node with at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding them all up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 \).

Therefore, the final count is  [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 3, 9)>
- <0, (5, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 3, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
