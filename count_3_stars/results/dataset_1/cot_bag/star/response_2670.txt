Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first analyze the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 9} (degree 5) -> inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 8} (degree 3) -> 1 3-star
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6} (degree 2) -> No 3-stars
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7} (degree 3) -> 1 3-star
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3} (degree 2) -> No 3-stars
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 7} (degree 3) -> 1 3-star
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6} (degree 4) -> inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: Neighbors {1} (degree 1) -> No 3-stars
- Node 9: Neighbors {0} (degree 1) -> No 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Thus, the final answer is [16] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>.
