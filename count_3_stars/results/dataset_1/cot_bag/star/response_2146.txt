Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 4)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 7)
- Node 2: 1 neighbor (node 9)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 5)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 7)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (nodes 3, 7)
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (node 7)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (node 9)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 8)

Based on the given information, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 contributes 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors).
Node 3 contributes 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors).
Node 4 contributes 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors).
Node 7 contributes 1 3-star (since it has exactly 3 neighbors).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
