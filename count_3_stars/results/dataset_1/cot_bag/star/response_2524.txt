Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3 has neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 7 has neighbors {3, 5, 6}
- Node 8 has neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 9 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 3:
Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
Since it has exactly 2 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

For node 7:
Since it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 3)>

For node 8:
Since it has 4 neighbors, we will calculate \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars:
<8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 9:
Since it has 4 neighbors, we will calculate \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 3-stars:
<9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Summing up the 3-stars, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 11 3-stars. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>
