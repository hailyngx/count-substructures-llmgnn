Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor which is less than 3.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6. So, from node 2, we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, and <2, (3, 5, 6)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 8. So, from node 3, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  - <3, (1, 2, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9. So, from node 6, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  - <6, (0, 2, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9. So, from node 8, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  - <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Putting all the possible 3-stars together, we find a total of [7] 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, and <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
