Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - 3-star 1: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
  - 3-star 2: <1, (2, 3, 9)>
  - 3-star 3: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
  - 3-star 4: <1, (3, 8, 9)>

- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - 3-star 5: <8, (1, 2, 5)>
  - 3-star 6: <8, (1, 2, 9)>
  - 3-star 7: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
  - 3-star 8: <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have found 8 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [8].
