Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to consider the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We'll then calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<2, (8, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 1)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (6, 1, 2)>
