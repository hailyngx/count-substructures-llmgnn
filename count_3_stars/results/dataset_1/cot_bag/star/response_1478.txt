Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}.

Node 0 has neighbors {3, 4, 6, 7, 9} -> forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has neighbors {0, 9} -> forms 0 3-stars.
Node 4 has neighbors {0, 1, 5, 6, 7} -> forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5} -> forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has neighbors {0, 3} -> forms 0 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Therefore, the answer is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>.
