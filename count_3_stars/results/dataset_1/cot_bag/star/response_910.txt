Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is 12.  
This can be represented as [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <3, (1, 6, 9)>
2. <6, (3, 7, 9)>
3. <9, (3, 6, 7)>
4. <9, (2, 3, 7)>
5. <9, (2, 6, 7)>
6. <9, (2, 6, 3)>
7. <9, (2, 7, 3)>
8. <9, (2, 7, 6)>
9. <9, (3, 6, 7)>
10. <9, (3, 7, 6)>
11. <9, (6, 7, 3)>
12. <9, (6, 3, 7)>
