Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 4
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 7
- Node 3 is connected to 4, 6, 7
- Node 4 is connected to 1, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 8, 9
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7 is connected to 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 is connected to 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-star
- Node 3 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 10 3-stars
- Node 6 can form 4 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 10 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 10 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [39].
