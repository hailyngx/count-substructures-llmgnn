Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7, 8

A 3-star is possible with the following nodes:
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [3 + 3 + 3] = [9]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 9.
