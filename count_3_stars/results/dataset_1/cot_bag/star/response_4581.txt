Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors along with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- For node 0: 1 3-star
- For node 1: 1 3-star
- For node 2: 1 3-star
- For node 4: 1 3-star
- For node 8: 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 120 = 124

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [124].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
