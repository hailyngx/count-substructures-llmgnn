Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in this graph: \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
