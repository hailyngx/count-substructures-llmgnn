Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges:  
(0, 6), (0, 8),  
(1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7),  
(2, 7), (2, 9),  
(3, 1), (3, 4),  
(4, 3),  
(5, 1),  
(6, 0), (6, 1),  
(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 9),  
(8, 0),  
(9, 2), (9, 7)  

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star.  
- Node 1 has three neighbors: 3, 5, and 6. So, from node 1, we can form 1 3-star.  
- Node 7 has three neighbors: 1, 2, and 9. So, from node 7, we can form 1 3-star.  

Putting this information together,  
Total number of 3-stars = [2]  
Unique 3-stars found = <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>
