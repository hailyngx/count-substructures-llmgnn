Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

```
    0 ---- 7
    |      | \ 
    |      |  (9)
    |      | /
    1 ---- 4 ---- 8
         / |
       (3) |
         \ |
           2 ---- 5
```

From the graph, the nodes that have at least three neighbors are nodes 2, 4, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is [28] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>.
