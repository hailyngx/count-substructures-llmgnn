Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7, 8

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 7 <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 7 <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- Node 2 forms two 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 7)> and <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 9 <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 2 <7, (0, 1, 2)> and a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, 2 <7, (8, 9, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, 7 <9, (2, 8, 7)>

Since each unique 3-star is listed once, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
