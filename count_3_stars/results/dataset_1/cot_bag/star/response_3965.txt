Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

- Node 0: This node has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 1: This node has no neighbors.
- Node 2: This node has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3: This node has 1 neighbor, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4: This node has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 5: This node has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: This node has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8), so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: This node has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8: This node has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9: This node has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Hence, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
