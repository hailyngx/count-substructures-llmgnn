Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 0 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
