Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
