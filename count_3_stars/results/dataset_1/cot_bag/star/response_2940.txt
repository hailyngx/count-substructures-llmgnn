Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the provided information, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
