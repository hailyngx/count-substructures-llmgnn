Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two nodes that have three or more neighbors: node 2 and node 6. We can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes.

For node 2:
\[ \binom{3}{2} = 3 \]

For node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars [] = 3 + 10 = 13.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 9, 2)>, 
<2, (6, 8, 2)>, 
<2, (6, 1, 3)>, 
<6, (2, 9, 6)>, 
<6, (2, 8, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<6, (2, 9, 6)>, 
<6, (2, 9, 6)>, 
<6, (2, 9, 6)>.
