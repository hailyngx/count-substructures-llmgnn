Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

Node 1 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star. <1, (5, 6)>
Node 2 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star. <2, (1, 4)>
Node 8 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star. <8, (0, 3)>
Node 9 (with 3 neighbors) can form 1 3-star. <9, (2, 7)>

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in total. The final answer is [4].
