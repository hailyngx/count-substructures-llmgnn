Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
- Node 0: 3, 8  
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7, 9  
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7  
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8  
- Node 4: 3, 7  
- Node 5: 6, 9  
- Node 6: 2, 5  
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 8  
- Node 8: 0, 3, 7, 9  
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8  

Calculating the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 9)>  
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 6)>, <2, (6, 5, 7)>  
- Node 3 forms 6 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 1, 8)>  
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 8)>  
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars: <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 1, 9)>  
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 8)>  

Summing up all the 3-stars: 1 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 15   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
