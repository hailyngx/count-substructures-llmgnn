Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 6, and 8) so it can form 1 3-star.
2. Node 2: Node 2 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9) so it can form 4 3-stars.
3. Node 3: Node 3 has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8) so it can form 20 3-stars.
4. Node 6: Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, and 9) so it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5) so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4] = 30.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 1, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (3, 7, 4)>
<3, (3, 7, 5)>
<3, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)> 

So the total number of 3-stars is [30].
