Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 7}
Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 4: {0, 3, 6}
Node 5: {2}
Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 8}
Node 8: {0, 1, 7}
Node 9: {0, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
