Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 8
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 5, 6
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 6
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 6
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1, 7
Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, so inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 5 neighbors, so inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total = 1 + 4 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<6, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 7)>.
