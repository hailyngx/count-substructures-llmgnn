Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 6, 1, 3, 9, and 7. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\)  (Node 0 has exactly 2 neighbors)
- Node 6: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  (There are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4)
- Node 1: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)  (Node 1 has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  (There are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4)
- Node 9: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\)  (There are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors out of 4)
- Node 7: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)  (Node 7 has exactly 3 neighbors)

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \([0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [14]\)

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 9, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (8, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
