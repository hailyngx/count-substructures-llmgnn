Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
After examining the provided edge list, we find the following nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 9

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is:
\[ [4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [16] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>
