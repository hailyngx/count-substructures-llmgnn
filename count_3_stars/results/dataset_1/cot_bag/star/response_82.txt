Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (not enough neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)

So, there is a total of 1 unique 3-star in this graph:
- <9, (6, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
