Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2

Now we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars on each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24 3-stars

So, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 6, 7)>.
