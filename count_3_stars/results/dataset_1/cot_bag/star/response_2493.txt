Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    1 -- 3 -- 5
    |    |    
    0 -- 4 -- 9
    |    
    7 -- 2    
    |         
    8 
```

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

So, there are a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 = 18 \) 3-stars in this graph.

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get: [18]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <4, 7, 9>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are: <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 7>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 4>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 9>, <4, 7, 9>.
