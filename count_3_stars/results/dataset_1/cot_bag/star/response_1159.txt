Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5

So, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48

So, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
