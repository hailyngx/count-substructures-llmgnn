Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed. 

Let's analyze the neighborhood of each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 5)
    - Total 3-stars from node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (4)
    - Node 1 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9)
    - Total 3-stars from node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (0)
    - Node 3 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 7)
    - Total 3-stars from node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (0)
    - Node 5 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (4, 9)
    - Total 3-stars from node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (2)
    - Node 8 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (2, 7)
    - Total 3-stars from node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:  
\[ [1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1] = [24] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 9, 2)>
- <9, (7, 2, 4)>
