Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to list the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges. 

Node 0 is connected to: 4, 7
Node 1 is connected to: 4, 5
Node 2 is connected to: 4, 7, 9
Node 4 is connected to: 0, 1, 2, 5
Node 5 is connected to: 1, 4, 8
Node 6 is connected to: 7, 8
Node 7 is connected to: 0, 2, 6
Node 8 is connected to: 5, 6
Node 9 is connected to: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 8)>

No other nodes have three or more neighbors, so there are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
