Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 35 = 55 \)

So, the final answer is [55].

The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (8, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (6, 1, 8)>, <4, (7, 5, 9)>, <4, (8, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
