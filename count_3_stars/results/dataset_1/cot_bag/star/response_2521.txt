Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
```
      0
     / \
    1 - 7 - 6
   /|   |\
  4 5   3-9
 /   \ /
2     8
```

Identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 12 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 7, 3>
- <1, 4, 2>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <3, 7, 0>
- <3, 7, 9>
- <3, 9, 0>
- <4, 2, 3>
- <7, 3, 9>
- <9, 8, 4>
