Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on each of the eligible nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 9, 6)>
  - <1, (0, 9, 1)>
  - <1, (0, 1, 6)>
  - <1, (9, 1, 6)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (6, 9, 4)>
  - <2, (6, 9, 2)>
  - <2, (4, 5, 2)>
  - <2, (5, 3, 2)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (1, 9, 6)>
  - <6, (1, 0, 6)>
  - <6, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <6, (2, 9, 6)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 4)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 2)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <9, (2, 4, 9)>
  - <9, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (2, 6, 4)>
  - <9, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (6, 8, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22, so the final answer is [22].
