Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we'll first list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7

For node 2, we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1] = 11 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
