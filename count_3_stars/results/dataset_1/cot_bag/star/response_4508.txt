Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has no neighbors
- Node 9 has no neighbors
- Nodes 0, 6, and 8 have 3 neighbors
- Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7 have 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 19 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars are:

- <0, (3, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
