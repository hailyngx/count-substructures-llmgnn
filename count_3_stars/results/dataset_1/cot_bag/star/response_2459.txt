Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15

So, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>
