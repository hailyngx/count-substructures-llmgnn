Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph based on the given information:

Node 0: has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 7), forms 1 3-star.
Node 1: has 1 neighbor, not eligible for a 3-star.
Node 2: has 2 neighbors, not eligible for a 3-star.
Node 3: has 1 neighbor, not eligible for a 3-star.
Node 4: has 1 neighbor, not eligible for a 3-star.
Node 5: has 4 neighbors (3, 6, 7, 9), forms 1 3-star.
Node 6: has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7), forms 1 3-star.
Node 7: has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8, 9), forms 1 3-star.
Node 8: has 1 neighbor, not eligible for a 3-star.
Node 9: has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7), forms 1 3-star.

So, there are a total of [\( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \)] = [1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4] = 23 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [23].
