Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can visualize the graph and identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 7) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 6) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (4, 6, 8) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

There is no node with more than 3 neighbors in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 6.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 8)>
