Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 5, 7.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors of node 0 (nodes 4, 5, 7).
So, the number of 3-stars for node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \), which means there is 1 unique 3-star.

For node 5:
There are 4 neighbors of node 5 (nodes 0, 3, 7, 9).
So, the number of 3-stars for node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), which results in 4 unique 3-stars.

For node 7:
There are 5 neighbors of node 7 (nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, 9).
So, the number of 3-stars for node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), which gives us 10 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 10] = 15 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
