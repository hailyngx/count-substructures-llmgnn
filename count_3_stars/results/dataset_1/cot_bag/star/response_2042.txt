Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6. 

For node 0: we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars with node 0 as the center are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, and <0, (2, 4, 6)>.

For node 2: we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars with node 2 as the center are <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, and <2, (0, 4, 5)>.

For node 4: we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars with node 4 as the center are <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, and <4, (0, 5, 9)>.

For node 5: we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars with node 5 as the center are <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, and <5, (0, 4, 2)>.

For node 6: we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars with node 6 as the center are <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, and <6, (0, 1, 4)>.

Adding all the 3-stars together gives a total of [20]. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
