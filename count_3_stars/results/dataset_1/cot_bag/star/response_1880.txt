Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 -> inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4 -> inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5 -> inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 6 -> inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 20 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) = 23
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
