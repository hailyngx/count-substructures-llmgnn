Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify which nodes have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 10.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
