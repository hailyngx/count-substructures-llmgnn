Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Edges: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5)

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors
Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 1 neighbor
Node 4 has 1 neighbor
Node 5 has 1 neighbor
Node 6 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 1 neighbor
Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Only nodes 0, 6, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 

Adding up: 0 3-stars total. 

So, the final answer is: [0].

There are no unique 3-stars in this graph, so there are no 3-stars to list.
