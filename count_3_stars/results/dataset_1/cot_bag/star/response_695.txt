Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Finding 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 9
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
In total, there are 1 + 1 + 10C3 + 4C3 + 5C3 + 5C3 + 5C3 + 1 + 4C3 = 1 + 1 + 120 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 161 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final result is [161].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
