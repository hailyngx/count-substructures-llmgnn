Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the nodes with three or more neighbors. 
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 32 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>.
