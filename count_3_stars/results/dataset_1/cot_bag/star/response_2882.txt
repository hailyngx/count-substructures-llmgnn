Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}.

Let's check each node to see if they form 3-stars.

Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 9 - it forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 9).
Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3 - it forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 3).
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4 - it forms 3-stars with neighbors (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4).
Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7 - it forms 3-stars with neighbors (1, 2, 6), (1, 2, 7), (1, 4, 7), (2, 6, 7).
Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 7 - it forms a 3-star with neighbors (2, 7).
Node 6 has neighbors: 3 - it does not form a 3-star.
Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 9 - it forms a 3-star with neighbors (3, 4, 9).
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 7 - it does not form a 3-star.

So, the 3-stars in this graph are: <0, (2, 9)>, <1, (2, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>.

There are [10] 3-stars in total in this graph.
