Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({{2}\choose {3}} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \({{4}\choose {3}} = 4\) Possible 3-stars: <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: \({{2}\choose {3}} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \({{3}\choose {3}} = 1\) Possible 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: \({{4}\choose {3}} = 4\) Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 4)>
- Node 6: \({{3}\choose {3}} = 1\) Possible 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 8: \({{2}\choose {3}} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ [0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0] = [10] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10. The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (6, 7, 8)>,
<5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 4)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
