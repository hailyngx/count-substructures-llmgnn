Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, and 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 6
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 8
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, and 8
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 51 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [51].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>.
