Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges in this graph are: {(0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 8), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2)}

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, as they are potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {2, 5, 6, 8}

For each of these nodes, let's count the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 2:
- (2, 6, 5)
- (2, 6, 8)
- (2, 6, 9)
- (2, 7, 8)
- (2, 8, 3)
- (2, 8, 5)
- (2, 8, 6)
- (2, 9, 6)

For node 5:
- (5, 8, 2)
- (5, 8, 6)

For node 6:
- (6, 5, 0)
- (6, 5, 8)
- (6, 2, 8)
- (6, 8, 5)

For node 8:
- (8, 5, 0)
- (8, 5, 6)
- (8, 6, 5)
- (8, 2, 6)
- (8, 3, 2)

Total number of 3-stars: [8 + 2 + 4 + 5] = [19]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, 6, 5>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 3>, <2, 8, 5>, 
<5, 8, 2>, <5, 8, 6>,
<6, 5, 0>, <6, 5, 8>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 8, 5>,
<8, 5, 0>, <8, 5, 6>, <8, 6, 5>, <8, 2, 6>, <8, 3, 2>
