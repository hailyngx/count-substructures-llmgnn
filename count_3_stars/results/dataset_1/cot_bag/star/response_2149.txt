Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
