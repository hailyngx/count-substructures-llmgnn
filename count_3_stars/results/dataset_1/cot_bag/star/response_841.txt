Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first organize the graph as described:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9
- Node 2 is connected to node 0
- Node 3 is connected to node 0
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars: 

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
    - Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: 
        - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
        - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
        - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
        - <0, (2, 6, 9)>
        - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
        - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
        - <0, (3, 6, 8)>
        - <0, (3, 6, 9)>
        - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
        - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
        - <0, (5, 8, 9)>
        - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
        - <0, (5, 6, 9)>
        - <0, (5, 9, 6)>
        - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
        - <0, (6, 9, 8)>
        - <0, (6, 5, 9)>
        - <0, (6, 9, 5)>
        - <0, (8, 5, 9)>
        - <0, (8, 9, 6)>
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Unique 3-star with node 4 as the center: 
        - <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - Unique 3-star with node 5 as the center: 
        - <5, (0, 6, 1)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - Unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 
        - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
        - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
        - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
        - <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Nodes 7, 8, and 9 each have 1 neighbor, so they cannot form any 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].
