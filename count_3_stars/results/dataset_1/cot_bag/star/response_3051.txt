Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 4 neighbors
Node 4: 1 neighbor
Node 5: 5 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 2 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 3, 9)>
