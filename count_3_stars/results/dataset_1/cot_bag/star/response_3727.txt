Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:  

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 7)  

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: it has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 8), so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 2: it has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 8), so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 3: it has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6), so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 5: it has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 6, 8), so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 6: it has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5), so it can form only 1 3-star.
For node 8: it has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5), so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
