Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 6)
(2, 4), (2, 5)
(3, 5), (3, 7)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8)
(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 9)
(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8)
(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7)
(9, 5), (9, 6)

Now we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: C(2, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: C(2, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 3: C(2, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: C(2, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 7: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
- Node 9: C(2, 3) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [14].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<4, (8, 5, 2)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<5, (8, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 9, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
