Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [19] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>
