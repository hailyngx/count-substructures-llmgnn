Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges based on the information provided.

The graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 8).
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8).
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3, and they are:
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>

So, the final answer is [3].
