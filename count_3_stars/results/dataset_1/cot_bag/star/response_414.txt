Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 0)>
<5, (7, 9, 1)>
