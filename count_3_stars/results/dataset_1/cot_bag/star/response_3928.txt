Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we construct the graph as described below:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 4.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9: <1, (3, 6, 9)>

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
There is 1 unique 3-star in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
