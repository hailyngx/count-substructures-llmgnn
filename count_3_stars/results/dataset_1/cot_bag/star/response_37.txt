Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:  
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 3), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 7)  

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 6, 9  
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3  
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 4, 7  
Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9  
Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9  
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 6, 7  

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:  
Node 0 forms 1 3-star, Node 2 forms 3 3-stars, Node 3 forms 3 3-stars, Node 6 forms 4 3-stars, Node 7 forms 4 3-stars, Node 9 forms 3 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 18  
So, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>
