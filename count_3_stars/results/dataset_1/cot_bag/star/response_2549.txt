Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given edges:  

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 1), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 9  
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6  
Node 3 has 2 neighbors  
Node 4 has 1 neighbor  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8  
Node 6 has 1 neighbor   
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 9  
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9  
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: No 3-stars (exactly 3 neighbors required)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [17] \).

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 7, 8)>  
<0, (1, 7, 9)>  
<0, (1, 8, 9)>  
<0, (7, 8, 9)>  
<5, (4, 8, 5)>  
<7, (0, 8, 9)>  
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
