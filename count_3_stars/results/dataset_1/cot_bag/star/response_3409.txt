Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

Node 0: 0 neighbors
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: 0 neighbors
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (6, 3, 9)>.
