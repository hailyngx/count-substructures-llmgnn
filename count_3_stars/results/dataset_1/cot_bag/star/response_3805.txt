Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to node 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 22 3-stars. Therefore, the final count is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 7, 9)>
