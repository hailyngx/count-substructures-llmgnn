Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 35 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 4, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 6, 7)>,
