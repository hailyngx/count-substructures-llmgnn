Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-star structures:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 8)>.

Node 3 has 2 neighbors, 2 and 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star can be formed with node 3.

Node 9 has 2 neighbors, 6 and 8. Like node 3, no 3-star can be formed with node 9.

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed, we have [1].

Therefore, the unique 3-star structure found in this graph is: <<0, (2, 4, 8)>>.
