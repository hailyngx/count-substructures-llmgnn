Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars present.
Let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 4)> and <3, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 8)>

Given the 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
