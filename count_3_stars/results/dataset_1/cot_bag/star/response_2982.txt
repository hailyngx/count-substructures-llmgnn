Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 -- 3 -- 8 -- 7
    |         |
    9         2 -- 6
              |
              |
              5
```

From the graph, we see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars: [(0, 3, 8), (0, 3, 9)]
- Node 2 has 2 3-stars: [(2, 3, 8), (2, 3, 6)]
- Node 3 has 2 3-stars: [(3, 0, 9), (3, 8, 7)]
- Node 8 has 2 3-stars: [(8, 3, 2), (8, 3, 7)]
- Node 9 has 1 3-star: [(9, 0, 5)]

The total number of 3-stars is 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9. 

So, the final answer is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <3, (0, 9, 8)>, <3, (8, 7, 3)>, <8, (3, 2, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>
