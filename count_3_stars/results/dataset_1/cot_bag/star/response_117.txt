Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 6

Based on the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:
- From node 0: <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- From node 2: <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- From node 6: <6, (2, 4, 9)>

Since each of these nodes forms exactly one 3-star, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
