Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 1 and node 5. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1:
\( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

For node 5:
\( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [4 + 10] = 14 \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 9, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
