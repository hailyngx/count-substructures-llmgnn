Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

For each node, let's count the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 0 has neighbors {4, 7, 8} --> [1] 3-star can be formed: <0, (4, 7, 8)>
Node 2 has neighbors {5, 8, 9} --> [1] 3-star can be formed: <2, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 3 has neighbors {4, 6, 7} --> [1] 3-star can be formed: <3, (4, 6, 7)>
Node 4 has neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9} --> [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-stars can be formed:
    <4, (0, 3, 8)>
    <4, (0, 3, 9)>
    <4, (0, 8, 9)>
    <4, (3, 8, 9)>
Node 8 has neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5} --> [4 choose 3 = 4] 3-stars can be formed:
    <8, (0, 2, 4)>
    <8, (0, 2, 5)>
    <8, (0, 4, 5)>
    <8, (2, 4, 5)>
Node 9 has neighbors {2, 4} --> No 3-star can be formed with less than 3 neighbors for node 9

The final total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 11.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
