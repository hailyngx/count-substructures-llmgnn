Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>
