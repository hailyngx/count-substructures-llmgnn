Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 7. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5.
Number of 3-stars with node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7.
Number of 3-stars with node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7.
Number of 3-stars with node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 26

Thus, there are 26 unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>.

So, the final answer is [26].
