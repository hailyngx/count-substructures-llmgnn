Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 2: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7}
Node 4: Neighbors = {1, 9}
Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 3}
Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 5}
Node 8: Neighbors = {2}
Node 9: Neighbors = {4}

We can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5 have three or more neighbors. 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, -)>
<1, (5, 0, -)>
<2, (1, 3, -)>
<2, (1, 5, -)>
<3, (1, 4, -)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
