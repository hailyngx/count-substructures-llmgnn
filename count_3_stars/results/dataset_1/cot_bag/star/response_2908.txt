Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <2, 1, 8>
- <4, 1, 8>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <7, 1, 8>
- <7, 1, 9>
- <7, 5, 9>
- <8, 1, 4>
- <8, 1, 5>
- <8, 5, 7>
- <8, 7, 9>
- <9, 1, 5>
- <9, 4, 5>
- <9, 7, 5>
