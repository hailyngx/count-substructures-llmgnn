Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 8)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15

So, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
