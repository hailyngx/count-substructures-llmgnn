Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 5, and 7.

For node 0:
- It has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 2:
- It has 2 neighbors: 4, 5
- Number of 3-stars: 0

For node 5:
- It has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>

For node 7:
- It has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 10 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
