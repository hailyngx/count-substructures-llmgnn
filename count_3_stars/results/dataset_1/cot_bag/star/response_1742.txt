Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 1: neighbors 0, 2, 8  
Node 2: neighbors 1, 3, 5, 6  
Node 3: neighbors 2, 6  
Node 4: neighbors 6, 8  
Node 5: neighbors 2, 7, 9  
Node 6: neighbors 2, 3, 4, 8, 9  
Node 8: neighbors 1, 4, 6, 9  
Node 9: neighbors 5, 6, 7, 8  

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23 \)  

Therefore, the final answer is [23].  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<1, (0, 2, 8)>  
<2, (1, 3, 5)>  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<2, (3, 5, 6)>  
<2, (5, 6, 9)>  
<6, (2, 3, 4)>  
<6, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (3, 4, 8)>  
<6, (4, 8, 9)>  
<8, (1, 4, 6)>  
<8, (1, 6, 9)>  
<8, (4, 6, 9)>  
<9, (5, 6, 7)>  
<9, (5, 7, 8)>  
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
