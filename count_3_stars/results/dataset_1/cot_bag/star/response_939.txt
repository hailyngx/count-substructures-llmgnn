Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, and the edges are listed as given. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10] = 29

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [29].
