Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 8)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 4, 1)>
  - <2, (4, 1, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 5, 1)>
  - <2, (5, 1, 6)>
  - <2, (0, 5, 4)>
  - <2, (5, 4, 6)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 2, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 0, 8)>
  - <4, (2, 0, 5)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 10] = 24.
