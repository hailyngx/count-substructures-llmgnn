Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - Possible 3-stars for node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [1 + 10] = 11 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 8)> and <4, (0, 2, 3)>.
