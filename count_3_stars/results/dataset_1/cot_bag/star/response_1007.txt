Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6
- Node 2: 6, 9
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2

From the list above, we see that the nodes 0, 1, 6 have three or more neighbors, so we will find the number of 3-stars they form. 

For node 0, it has 4 neighbors, so the number of 3-stars it forms is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$.

For node 1, it has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

For node 6, it has 5 neighbors, so it forms $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars.

Adding these up: $4 + 1 + 10 = 15$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
