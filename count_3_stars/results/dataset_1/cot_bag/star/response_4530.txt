Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph as described:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6)
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6)
(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9)
(4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8)
(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 9)
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 9)
(7, 5), (7, 8)
(8, 4), (8, 7)
(9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the unique 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <1, (0, 4, 6)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <5, (1, 3, 9)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <6, (0, 2, 4)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars using \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 4: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 8: 1 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of 7 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
