Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

Unique 3-stars found:

2. <2, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 9)>
5. <3, (6, 8, 9)>
6. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 9)>
8. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
9. <6, (3, 9, 7)>
10. <6, (3, 9, 8)>
11. <9, (3, 6, 7)>
12. <9, (3, 6, 8)>
13. <9, (6, 7, 8)>
14. <9, (6, 8, 3)>
