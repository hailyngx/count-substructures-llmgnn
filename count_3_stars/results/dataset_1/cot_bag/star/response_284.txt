Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph with the given information can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 3), (5, 0), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {4, 5, 6, 7, 9}, forming 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {3, 8, 9}, forming 1 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {1, 6, 7, 9}, forming 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}, forming 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
