Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's determine the number of neighbors each node has:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 1 neighbor
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 1 neighbor
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
    <3, (2, 7, 8)>
    <3, (7, 5, 9)>
    <3, (2, 7, 5)>
    <3, (2, 7, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    <5, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
    <7, (3, 5, 9)>
    <7, (3, 2, 8)>
    <7, (5, 9, 3)>
    <7, (5, 9, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
    <9, (5, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 5, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 2, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 7)>.
