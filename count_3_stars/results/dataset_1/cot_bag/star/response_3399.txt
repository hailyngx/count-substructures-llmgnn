Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (2, 3, 6), so there is 1 3-star. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (4, 6, 8), so there is 1 3-star. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (0, 6, 8), so there is 1 3-star. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 3, 8), so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (1, 3, 6, 7, 9), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 17

Therefore, there are 17 3-stars in this graph.  [17]
