Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
        - Node 0: 1 neighbor (1)
        - Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7)
        - Node 2: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8)
        - Node 3: 2 neighbors (2, 8)
        - Node 4: 4 neighbors (2, 6, 9)
        - Node 5: 1 neighbor (1)
        - Node 6: 1 neighbor (4)
        - Node 7: 2 neighbors (1, 8)
        - Node 8: 5 neighbors (2, 3, 7, 9)
        - Node 9: 2 neighbors (4, 8)
        
        Calculating the number of 3-stars:
        - Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
        - Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
        - Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
        - Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
        
        Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 16
        So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
        
        Unique 3-stars:
        <1, (0, 5, 7)>
        <2, (3, 4, 8)>
        <4, (2, 6, 9)>
        <8, (2, 3, 7)>
        <8, (2, 3, 9)>
        <8, (2, 4, 9)>
        <8, (3, 7, 9)>
        <8, (4, 7, 9)>
        <8, (2, 7, 9)>
        <8, (3, 4, 9)>
        <8, (3, 4, 7)>
        <8, (2, 3, 4)>
        <8, (2, 4, 7)>
        <8, (2, 3, 6)>
        <8, (2, 4, 6)>
        <8, (3, 6, 7)>
