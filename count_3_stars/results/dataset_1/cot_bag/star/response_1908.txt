Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9 and the edges are given. Let's determine the 3-star graphs in this network.

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with at least three neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 24.

So, the final answer is [24].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 5>
- <2, 5, 6>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 5, 9>
- <4, 0, 3>
- <4, 5, 6>
- <5, 0, 8>
- <5, 2, 9>
- <5, 3, 6>
- <5, 4, 6>
- <9, 1, 2>
- <9, 2, 6>
- <9, 3, 6>
