Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 1: 0, 5, 8, 9  
Node 2: 4, 7  
Node 3: 4  
Node 4: 2, 3  
Node 5: 0, 1, 8, 9  
Node 6: 0, 8  
Node 7: 2  
Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 6  
Node 9: 0, 1, 5  

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars:  
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 0.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 1.  
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving node 5.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 4 = 18.  

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 5, 8)>  
<0, (1, 5, 9)>  
<0, (1, 8, 5)>  
<0, (1, 9, 5)>  
<0, (5, 1, 8)>  
<0, (5, 1, 9)>  
<0, (5, 8, 1)>  
<0, (5, 9, 1)>  
<1, (0, 5, 8)>  
<1, (0, 5, 9)>  
<1, (5, 0, 8)>  
<1, (5, 0, 9)>  
<5, (0, 1, 8)>  
<5, (0, 1, 9)>  
<5, (1, 0, 8)>  
<5, (1, 0, 9)>  
<8, (0, 1, 5)>  
<8, (0, 5, 1)>  

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
