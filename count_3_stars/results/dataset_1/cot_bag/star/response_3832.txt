Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0: This node has 1 neighbor (node 1), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 9, and 9). Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2: This node has 1 neighbor (node 7), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 3: This node has 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 7, and 7). Therefore, it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 7, and 7). Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 7, and 9). Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6: This node has 1 neighbor (node 8), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7: This node has 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9). Therefore, it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8: This node has 1 neighbor (node 6), so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9: This node has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, and 7). Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are: <1, 9, 5>, <3, 4, 7>, <3, 5, 7>, <3, 7, 9>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 2, 4>, <7, 2, 5>, <7, 3, 4>, <7, 3, 5>, <7, 3, 9>, <7, 4, 5>, <7, 4, 9>, <7, 5, 9>, <9, 1, 5>, <9, 5, 7>.
