Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
