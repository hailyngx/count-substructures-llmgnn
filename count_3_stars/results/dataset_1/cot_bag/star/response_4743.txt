Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (0, 2)
- Node 1: (1, 2)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (2, 6, 9)
- Node 4: (6, 8)
- Node 5: (6, 8)
- Node 6: (3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 7: (2)
- Node 8: (2, 4, 5)
- Node 9: (3, 6)

Let's now find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 and Node 5 have 2 neighbors each, so they cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating the total: \( 10 + 1 + 4 = 15 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (7, 8, 0)>
- <2, (7, 8, 1)>
- <2, (8, 1, 3)>
