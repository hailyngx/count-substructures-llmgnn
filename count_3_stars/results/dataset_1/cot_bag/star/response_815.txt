Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- For Node 0:
  - Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 9.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 0 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <0, (1, 5, 9)>

- For Node 1:
  - Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 7.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>

- For Node 2:
  - Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, and 9.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>

- For Node 3:
  - Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, and 9.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- For Node 4:
  - Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, and 7.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>

- For Node 6:
  - Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 6 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>

- For Node 7:
  - Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

- For Node 9:
  - Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
  - Total 3-stars with Node 9 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 47

So, the final answer is [47].
