Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Here is a list of the 3-stars in this graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [10]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, >
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, >
<5, (6, 3, >
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, >
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
