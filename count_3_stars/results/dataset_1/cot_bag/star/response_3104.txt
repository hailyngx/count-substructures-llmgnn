Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 have 5 neighbors each, so they can potentially form 10 3-stars each (since \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)).

Node 0, 1, 6, and 7 have 3 neighbors each, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 5 \times 10 + 4 \times 1 = 50 + 4 = 54 \) [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
