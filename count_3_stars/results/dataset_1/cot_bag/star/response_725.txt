Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with nodes and edges.

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 3), (0, 7), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4), (8, 9), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations in this graph based on the rules mentioned earlier:

For node 0: (0, 3), (0, 7)
For node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 9)
For node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 9)
For node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 4)
For node 9: (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now we count the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star
Node 3 forms 1 3-star
Node 4 forms 1 3-star
Node 7 forms 1 3-star
Node 9 forms 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (3, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
