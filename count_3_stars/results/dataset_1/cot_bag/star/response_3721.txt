Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we can identify the following nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2}

We can see that only nodes 0, 2, and 5 each have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars from these nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

Adding these together, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 4 = 34 3-stars in this graph, which we will represent as [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 4, 5)>
