Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 4, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 3>
<5, 6, 7>
<6, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
