Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 7
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these together, we get a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10 3-stars. 

Thus, the final answer is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
