Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0 and node 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 = 40

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
