Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Finding the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 30 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 4)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 3, 9)>
<1, (7, 3, 4)>
<1, (8, 0, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (7, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
