Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four nodes with at least three neighbors: 0, 1, 4, and 9.

For node 0, there are 3 possible 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 9, 5)>, <0, (5, 4, 9)>. Therefore, [3].

For node 1, there is only 1 possible 3-star: <1, (7, 8, 6)>. Therefore, [1].

For node 4, there are 3 possible 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 9, 3)>, <4, (3, 0, 9)>. Therefore, [3].

For node 9, there are 4 possible 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 0, 6)>, <9, (4, 0, 7)>. Therefore, [4].

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get [3 + 1 + 3 + 4] = [11].
