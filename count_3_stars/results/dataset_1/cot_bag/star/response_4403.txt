Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
We will go through each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed with it:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars can be formed.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 64 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<1, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (8, 4, 1)>
<2, (8, 6, 1)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
