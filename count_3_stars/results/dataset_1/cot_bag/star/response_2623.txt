Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 9}, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 8}, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 22\).

The unique 3-stars in this 3-star graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
