Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars in this graph. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 3, 8, 9 

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 35 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (8, 0, 1)>, <3, (8, 0, 9)>, <3, (8, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 0, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>
