Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6

Calculating the number of common neighbors for all pairs of nodes, we find that nodes {3, 4, 6}, {3, 6, 9}, and {4, 6, 9} form 3-star graphs.

Thus, the total number of 3-star graphs in this network is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
