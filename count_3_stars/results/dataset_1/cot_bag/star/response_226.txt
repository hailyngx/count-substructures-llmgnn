Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: node 2, node 4, node 5, and node 7.

For node 2:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 2:
<[2, 0, 5], [2, 3, 8], [2, 5, 8], [2, 0, 5]>

For node 4:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 4:
<[4, 1, 5], [4, 1, 7], [4, 7, 9], [4, 5, 7]>

For node 5:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 5:
<[5, 0, 1], [5, 0, 2], [5, 7, 8], [5, 1, 7]>

For node 7:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars formed with node 7:
<[7, 4, 5], [7, 4, 9], [7, 5, 8], [7, 5, 9]>

Putting all together:
There are 16 3-stars in total. 
So, the final answer is [16].
