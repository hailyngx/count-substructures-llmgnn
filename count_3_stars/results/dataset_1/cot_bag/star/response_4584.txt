Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each
- Therefore, there are 6 3-stars in total for these nodes

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<1, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
