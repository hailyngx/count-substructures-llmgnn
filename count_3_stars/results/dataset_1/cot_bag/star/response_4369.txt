Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes and sum them up at the end.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8

Let's find the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 2, 4
    - Number of 3-stars around node 0: 0

2. Node 2:
    - Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8
    - Number of 3-stars around node 2: 1

3. Node 4:
    - Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
    - Number of 3-stars around node 4: 1

4. Node 8:
    - Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9
    - Number of 3-stars around node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>.
