Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

There are no 3-stars for nodes with less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (8, 7, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 2)>
