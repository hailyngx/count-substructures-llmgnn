Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: nodes 2 and 4. Thus, it does not form a 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: nodes 2 and 9. Thus, it does not form a 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 7 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. 
- By applying the formula, \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \), we find that there are 35 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- By applying the formula, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), we find that there are 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- There is exactly 1 3-star with node 4 as the center.

For nodes 5, 6, and 7:
- Similar to nodes 0, 1, and 7, they do not form 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- By applying the formula, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), we find that there are 4 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- By applying the formula, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), we find that there are 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Putting these results together, we have a total of \( 35 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 54 \) 3-stars in this graph: [54].

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, and <9, (1, 3, 7)>.
