Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 7
- Node 2: 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>
