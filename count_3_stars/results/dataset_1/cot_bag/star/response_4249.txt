Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}. As it has 5 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {0, 5}. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: {0, 7}. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {0, 6, 9}. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: {0, 9}. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: {1}. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {0, 3, 8}. It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {2, 8}. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: {6, 7}. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: {3, 4}. It cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, and the unique 3-stars are:

[3] 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
