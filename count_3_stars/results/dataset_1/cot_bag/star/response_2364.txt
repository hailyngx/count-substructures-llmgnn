Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and edges described can be visually represented as follows:

```
    0 -- 5 -- 4 -- 8 -- 2
   /|\   |    |    |    |
  9 | 6  7    1    5    | 
   \|/   |\   |\   |\   /  
    7 -- 3 -- 1 -- 4 
```


Node 0 has 4 neighbors, nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6 have 4 neighbors each, and node 7 has 6 neighbors. 

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n!}{3! \cdot (n-3)!} \) to these nodes, we get:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \[ [4 + 4*4 + 20] = [4 + 16 + 20] = [40] \]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
