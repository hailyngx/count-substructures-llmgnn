Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 29 3-stars.

So the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
