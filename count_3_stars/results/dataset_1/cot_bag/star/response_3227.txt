Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 1, 2

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0:
- Only one 3-star can be formed with node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>

For Node 1:
- One 3-star can be formed with node 1: <1, (0, 3, 9)>

For Node 3:
- Two 3-stars can be formed with node 3: <3, (1, 2, 8)> and <3, (1, 7, 6)>

Putting this together, we have [1] 3-star in this graph, which are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, and <3, (1, 2, 8)>.
