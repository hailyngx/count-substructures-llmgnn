Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can represent the graph with the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
