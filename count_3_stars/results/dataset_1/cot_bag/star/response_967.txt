Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's first list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 7
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 2, 8
Node 6: 2, 8
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 5, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 unique 3-stars)
Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Among these nodes, only Node 2 forms 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>.
