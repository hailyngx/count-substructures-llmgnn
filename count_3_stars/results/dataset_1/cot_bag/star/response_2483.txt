Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graph configurations in this graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors.

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form.

Calculating for each applicable node:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 6) + 3 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 8) = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 5, 0>
<2, 5, 1>
<2, 6, 3>
<2, 7, 3>
<3, 1, 5>
<3, 6, 2>
<3, 7, 2>
<4, 0, 5>
