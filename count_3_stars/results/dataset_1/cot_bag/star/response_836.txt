Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's first list the nodes with the number of neighbors they have:

- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 3, 5, and 8: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 7: <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 0, 1, and 6: <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 6, and 7: <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star with neighbors 1, 7, and 8: <5, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
