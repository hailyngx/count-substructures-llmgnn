Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of 25 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is: [25] 
And the unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 8, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>
