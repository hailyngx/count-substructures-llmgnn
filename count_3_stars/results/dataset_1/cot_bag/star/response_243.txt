Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 24

So, there are 24 3-stars in this graph: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>.

Therefore, the answer is [24].
