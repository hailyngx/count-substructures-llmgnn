Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 2: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 5: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: Not applicable as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>.
