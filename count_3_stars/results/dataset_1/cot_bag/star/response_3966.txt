Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are six nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with 0 as the center. The unique 3-stars for node 0 are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, and <0, (1, 3, 5)>.

For node 1, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with 1 as the center. The unique 3-stars for node 1 are <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, and <1, (0, 4, 8)>.

For node 2, there are 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with 2 as the center. The unique 3-stars for node 2 are <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, and <2, (0, 5, 8)>.

For node 5, there are 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6. Since it's exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 3-star with 5 as the center, which is <5, (0, 2, 6)>.

For node 8, there are 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with 8 as the center. The unique 3-stars for node 8 are <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, and <8, (1, 3, 7)>.

Adding these all up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
