Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:  
Node 0: 3, 8, 9  
Node 1: 6, 8  
Node 2: 5, 7, 9  
Node 3: 0, 6  
Node 4: 7  
Node 5: 2  
Node 6: 1, 3, 7  
Node 7: 2, 4, 6  
Node 8: 0, 1, 9  
Node 9: 0, 2, 8  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars taking into account the advice provided earlier.  

Now weâ€™ll go through each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

Adding these up gives the total number of 3-stars as [5].

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
