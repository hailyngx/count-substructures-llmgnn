Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (1 < 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (1 < 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (1 < 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (2 < 3). It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3 = 3). It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (1 < 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (2 < 3). It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2 < 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (2 < 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 1 (from node 3) which gives [1] in total.
The unique 3-star is <3, (0, 4, 9)> in this graph.
