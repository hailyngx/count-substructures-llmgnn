Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:

- Node 0: 0 has 2 neighbors (2, 4), so it can form no 3-star.
- Node 1: 1 has only 1 neighbor (8), so it can form no 3-star.
- Node 2: 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: 3 has 2 neighbors (2, 5), so it can form no 3-star.
- Node 4: 4 has 2 neighbors (0, 6), so it can form no 3-star.
- Node 5: 5 has 1 neighbor (3), so it can form no 3-star.
- Node 6: 6 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7: 7 has 1 neighbor (6), so it can form no 3-star.
- Node 8: 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: 9 has 2 neighbors (2, 8), so it can form no 3-star.

In total, there are [1] 3-stars. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 3, 9)> and <6, (4, 8, 9)>.
