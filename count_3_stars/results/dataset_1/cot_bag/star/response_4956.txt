Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 5: 1 3-star <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star <9, (4, 5, 6)>
  
There are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.
