Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To start with, let's create a visual representation of the graph. 

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0,7), (0,9), (1,2), (1,7), (1,9), (2,1), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (4,5), (5,4), (5,7), (6,2), (6,7), (6,8), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,5), (7,6), (7,9), (8,2), (8,6), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (9,7)

The following is the visual representation of the graph with the given edges:
```
0 --- 7
|     | \
|     |  9
|     |
1 --- 2 --- 8
|   / | \
|  /  6  9
| /
3

4 --- 5 --- 7
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed using each of them. 

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 7 has 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7

Calculating the 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
\<2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 
\<7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
\<9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10 + 35 + 4] = 49

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the given graph is 49.
