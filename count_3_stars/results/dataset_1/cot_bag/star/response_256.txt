Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {1, 8}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 8}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {7}

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, Node 2 has 3 neighbors, and Node 8 has 3 neighbors. So, we can form 1 3-star at Node 0, 1 3-star at Node 2, and 1 3-star at Node 8. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>.
