Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8

Based on the given criteria, we can identify the 3-stars: 

- For Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- For Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 9, 1)>
- For Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)> 

Counting these, we have a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
