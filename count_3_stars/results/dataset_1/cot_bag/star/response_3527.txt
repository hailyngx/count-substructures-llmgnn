Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and we have the following edges in the graph:

(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8)
(1, 5), (1, 9)
(2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8)
(3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 8)
(5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 9)
(6, 3)
(7, 2)
(8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9)
(9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

For node 0:
- It has neighbors 2, 3, 5, and 8, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 2:
- It has neighbors 0, 5, 7, and 8, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
- It has neighbors 0, 6, and 8, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<3, (0, 6, 8)>

For node 5:
- It has neighbors 0, 1, 2, and 9, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>

For node 8:
- It has neighbors 0, 2, 3, and 9, forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>

For node 9:
- It has neighbors 1, 5, and 8, forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

There are a total of 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the final count is [18].
