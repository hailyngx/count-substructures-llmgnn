Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: [ inom{4}{3} ] = 4
- Node 1: No 3-star
- Node 2: [ inom{3}{3} ] = 1
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: [ inom{4}{3} ] = 4
- Node 6: [ inom{6}{3} ] = 20
- Node 7: [ inom{4}{3} ] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
