Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

Node 0: 2, 6, 9
Node 1: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 8
Node 3: 7, 9
Node 4: 1, 6, 8
Node 5: 1, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
Node 7: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 3: No 3-stars
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 5: No 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>.
