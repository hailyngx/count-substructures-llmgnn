Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
Graph:
0 -- 5 -- 7 -- 8 -- 1
 \    |    |    | /
  9 -- 4 -- 6 -- 2
          | /
          3

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8)
```

Next, we'll identify nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, giving us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 9, 8)>
  - <4, (9, 8, 7)>
  - <4, (8, 7, 5)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, giving us 1 additional 3-star: <5, (6, 0, 7)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, but we've already counted all possible 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, but we've already counted all possible 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5,. 

Putting this final count inside brackets gives us the answer: [5].
