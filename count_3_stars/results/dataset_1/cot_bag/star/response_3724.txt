Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph with its nodes and edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Edges: (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 5), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 8
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 6
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, and 9
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 7
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 7

By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node. 
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [C(3,3) + C(6,3) + C(4,3) + C(3,3)] = [1 + 20 + 4 + 1] = [26].

Unique 3-stars in this graph include:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
