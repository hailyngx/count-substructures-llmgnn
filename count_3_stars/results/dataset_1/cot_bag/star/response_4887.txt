Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 6, 8

Following the guidelines given, we will now count the number of 3-stars in this graph:  

Node 2 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors:
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 3 forms 3-stars with the following set of neighbors:
- <3, (2, 4, 6)>

Node 4 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors:
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>

We have a total of 1 + 3 + 1 + 6 = 11 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>
