Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 1: Less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star.
- Node 2: Less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star.
- Node 3: Exactly 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star.
- Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 7: Less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star.
- Node 8: Less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star.
- Node 9: Exactly 3 neighbors, forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
