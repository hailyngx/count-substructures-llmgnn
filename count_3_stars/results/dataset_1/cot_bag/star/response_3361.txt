Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. To do so, we can create a list of the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2

Nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

For Node 1:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 3:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 5:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 6:
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

For Node 7:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For Node 8:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Since these nodes are independent of each other in forming 3-stars, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24 \]

Therefore, there are 24 3-stars in the graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[<1, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)> \]

Putting this final number inside brackets gives:
\[ [24] \]
