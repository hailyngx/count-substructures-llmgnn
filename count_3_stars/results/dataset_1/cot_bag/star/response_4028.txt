Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edges, the nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 have at least three neighbors each.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these six nodes:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 and Node 9 cannot form any 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors each

Adding up all 3-stars, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13 \) 3-stars. 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, 0)>
