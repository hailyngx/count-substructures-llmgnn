Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 5.
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, there are a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 \) 3-stars in this graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets: [9]
Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>
