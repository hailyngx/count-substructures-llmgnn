Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Calculating the 3-stars:
- For Node 2, we have 1 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 6)>
- For Node 3, we have 1 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 6)>
- For Node 4, we have 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- For Node 5, we have 0 3-stars.
- For Node 6, we have 1 3-star: <6, (2, 9, 3)>
- For Node 7, we have 1 3-star: <7, (5, 9, 3)>
- For Node 8, we have 1 3-star: <8, (9, 2, 5)>
- For Node 9, we have 1 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, and <8, (9, 2, 5)>.
