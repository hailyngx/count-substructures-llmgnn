Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 2: 0 3-stars
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: 0 3-stars
Node 5: 0 3-stars
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 7: 0 3-stars
Node 8: 0 3-stars
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, and <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
