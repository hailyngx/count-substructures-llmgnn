Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 22

Therefore, the final answer is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <2, 0, 8>
- <4, 0, 8>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <7, 6, 9>
- <8, 0, 2>
- <9, 7, 4>
- <9, 7, 6>
- <9, 7, 8>
- <9, 8, 6>
- <9, 8, 7>
- <9, 6, 7>
- <9, 6, 8>
- <9, 3, 1>
- <9, 1, 4>
- <9, 1, 0>
- <4, 1, 9>
- <2, 4, 0>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <6, 8, 0>
- <8, 6, 9>
- <0, 8, 2>
