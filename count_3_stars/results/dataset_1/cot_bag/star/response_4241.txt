Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 8
- Node 4: 0, 5
- Node 5: 4, 8
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>

For Node 4:
- It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 5:
- It has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

For Node 8:
- It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>

For Node 9:
- It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Putting it all together, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
