Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [4 + 1] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
