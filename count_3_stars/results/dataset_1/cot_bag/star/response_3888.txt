Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula explained earlier.

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results, we get a total of \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60 \) 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 3>
<1, 0, 4>
<1, 0, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 1, 4>
<2, 4, 6>
<4, 1, 7>
<4, 2, 6>
<4, 6, 8>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 4, 8>
<6, 4, 9>
<7, 0, 9>
<8, 4, 7>
<8, 4, 9>
<9, 0, 3>
<9, 6, 8>
