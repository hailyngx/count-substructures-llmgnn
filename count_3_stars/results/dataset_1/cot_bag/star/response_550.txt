Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 5)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 8, 9)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 48 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
