Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Based on the description provided, the 3-stars are as follows:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star <8, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
