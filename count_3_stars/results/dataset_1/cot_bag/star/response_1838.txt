Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {7, 8}
- Node 5: {3}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {1}

The nodes that have three or more neighbors and can potentially form a 3-star are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed at each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 26 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [ 26 ].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
