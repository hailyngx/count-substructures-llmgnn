Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 20 + 1] = [25].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
