Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 4 has neighbors {3, 6}
- Node 6 has neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7 has neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 9 has neighbors {0, 5, 6}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( 3 \choose 3 \) = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms \( 2 \choose 3 \) = 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( 2 \choose 3 \) = 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms \( 4 \choose 3 \) = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms \( 2 \choose 3 \) = 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( 3 \choose 3 \) = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
