Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2 
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [31]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>
