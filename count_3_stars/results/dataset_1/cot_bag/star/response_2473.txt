Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors where 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars originating from these nodes:
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for Node 0
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for Node 1
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars for Node 3
- \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for Node 4
- \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars for Node 7
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for Node 9

Adding these results, we have a total of \( [1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 10] = 53 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (5, 9, 0)>
- <7, (6, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (3, 8, 4)>
- <7, (3, 1, 9)>
- <7, (3, 2, 9)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 8)>
- <9, (7, 4, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 2)>
- <9, (6, 3, 1)>
