Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <1, (0, 3, 4)> <1, (0, 3, 8)> <1, (0, 3, 9)> <1, (0, 4, 8)> <1, (0, 4, 9)> 
  <1, (3, 4, 8)> <1, (3, 4, 9)> <1, (3, 8, 9)> <1, (4, 8, 9)> <1, (0, 9, 3)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (1, 4, 8)> <3, (1, 4, 9)> <3, (1, 9, 8)> <3, (4, 8, 9)> 

- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  <4, (1, 3, 8)> <4, (1, 3, 9)> <4, (1, 8, 9)> <4, (3, 8, 9)> 
  <4, (1, 2, 6)> <4, (1, 2, 8)> <4, (2, 6, 8)> <4, (2, 6, 9)> 
  <4, (2, 8, 9)> <4, (6, 8, 9)> <4, (5, 6, 8)> <4, (5, 6, 9)> 
  <4, (5, 8, 9)> <4, (2, 4, 6)> <4, (2, 4, 8)> <4, (4, 6, 8)> 
  <4, (4, 6, 9)> <4, (4, 8, 9)> <4, (5, 6, 8)> <4, (5, 6, 9)> 

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <8, (1, 3, 4)> <8, (1, 3, 9)> <8, (1, 4, 9)> <8, (3, 4, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  <9, (0, 1, 3)> <9, (0, 1, 4)> <9, (0, 3, 4)> <9, (0, 3, 8)> 
  <9, (0, 4, 8)> <9, (1, 3, 4)> <9, (1, 3, 8)> <9, (1, 4, 8)> 
  <9, (3, 4, 8)> <9, (0, 8, 3)> <9, (0, 8, 4)> <9, (0, 8, 9)> 
  <9, (0, 4, 9)> <9, (1, 8, 4)> <9, (1, 8, 3)> <9, (1, 8, 9)> 
  <9, (8, 4, 3)> <9, (8, 4, 1)> <9, (8, 3, 1)> <9, (4, 3, 1)> 

Total number of 3-stars = \(10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 58\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].
