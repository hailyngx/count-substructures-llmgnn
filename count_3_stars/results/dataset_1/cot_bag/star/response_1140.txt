Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (7)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 6)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8, 6)
- Node 5: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 9)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (3, 6, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 20.

Therefore, the answer is [20] and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 9, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
