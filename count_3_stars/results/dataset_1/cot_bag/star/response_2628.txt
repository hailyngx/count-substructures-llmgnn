Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 --- 7
   /|\
  1-8-9
 /   |
5    |
    2-6
       |
       3
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 1] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars are:

- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (2, 3, 6)> 

So, putting the final count inside brackets and listing the unique 3-stars inside angle brackets gives us the result:

\[ [6], \text{ <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 6)>} \]
