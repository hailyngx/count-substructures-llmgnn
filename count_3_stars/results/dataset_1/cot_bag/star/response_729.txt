Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
0 --- 3 --- 4 --- 6 --- 9
|           |       |
|           |       |
8           0       9
           / \
          /   \
        7       5
       /         |
      2          1
```

We'll now identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: [3, 4, 8], forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. Node 2 has neighbors: [1, 7], so no 3-star.
3. Node 3 has neighbors: [0, 4], so no 3-star.
4. Node 4 has neighbors: [0, 3, 6, 9], forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center: 
   - <4, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <4, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <4, (3, 6, 9)>
5. Node 5 has neighbors: [1, 7], so no 3-star.
6. Node 6 has neighbors: [4, 9], so no 3-star.
7. Node 7 has neighbors: [2, 5], so no 3-star.
8. Node 8 has neighbors: [0], so no 3-star.
9. Node 9 has neighbors: [4, 6], so no 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4] = 5.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, and <4, (3, 6, 9)>.
