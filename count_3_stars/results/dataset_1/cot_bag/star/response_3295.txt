Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 6       1 --- 6
        |       |
        |       |       9
        |       | /
        |       /
        |     /
        |   /
        2 --- 4 -- 8 ---- 3
             |       |
             |       |
             |       |
             9       7 ---- 5
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 7).

Node 8 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 9).

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 = 5 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
