Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

We'll now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 52 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
