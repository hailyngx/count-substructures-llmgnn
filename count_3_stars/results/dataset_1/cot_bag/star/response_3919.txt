Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we start by identifying the nodes with three or more neighbors since those are the only ones that can be part of 3-stars.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 43

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
