Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 9.

For node 0:
There are 2 possible 3-stars with node 0: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 3, 9)>

For node 1:
There are 2 possible 3-stars with node 1: 
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (7, 9, 2)>

For node 4:
There is 1 possible 3-star with node 4: 
<4, (0, 3, 9)>

For node 9:
There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 9: 
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>

Adding these up: 2 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 9

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in this graph.
