Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. 
Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: it has 2 neighbors (4 and 8), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 1: it has 3 neighbors (2, 4, and 8), so it can form 1 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 8)>.

For node 2: it has 3 neighbors (1, 7, and 8), so it can form 1 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 8)>.

For node 3: it has 2 neighbors (6 and 7), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 4: it has 2 neighbors (0 and 1), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 6: it has 1 neighbor (3), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 7: it has 2 neighbors (2 and 3), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 8: it has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, and 9), so it can form 1 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 9)>.

For node 9: it has 1 neighbor (8), so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the 3-stars in this graph are: 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, and <8, (0, 1, 9)>.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
