Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 2, 6, 7

Based on the number of neighbors each node has, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star: <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
