Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:  
Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8   
Node 1: 3   
Node 2: 0, 8   
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6  
Node 4: 0, 6, 7  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 9  
Node 7: 4, 6, 8  
Node 8: 0, 2, 7  
Node 9: 6  

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 15 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
