Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually to better understand its structure:

```
    1 -- 4
   / \   |
  /   \  |
 5     6 |
  \   /  |
   \ /   |
    7    8
     \  /
      9
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9]. The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, 4, 5, 6>
- <1, 4, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 6, 8>
- <1, 5, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 8, 9>
