Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (node has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (node has less than 3 neighbors)

Summing these up: 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 33 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 7)>.
