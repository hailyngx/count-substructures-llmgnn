Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 6

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up gives us a total of 14 3-stars: [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
