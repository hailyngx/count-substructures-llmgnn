Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors (7, 9).
Node 1 has 1 neighbor (3).
Node 2 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 9).
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 9).
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (2, 9).
Node 5 has 1 neighbor (6).
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (3, 5).
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8).
Node 8 has 1 neighbor (7).
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4).

Calculating the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 3, 4, and 9).
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 1, 2, and 9).
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star (with nodes 0, 2, and 8).
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars (with nodes 0, 2, and 3).

Adding them up: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13\)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
