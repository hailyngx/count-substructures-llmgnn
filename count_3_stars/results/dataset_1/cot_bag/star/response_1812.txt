Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars using the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will examine each node individually:

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors (nodes 3, 6, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1: Node 1 has 2 neighbors (nodes 2, 7), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

3. Node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 6), so it can form 1 3-star. <2, (1, 5, 6)>

4. Node 3: Node 3 has 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 7), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

5. Node 4: Node 4 has 1 neighbor (node 5), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

6. Node 5: Node 5 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 6), so it can form 1 3-star. <5, (2, 4, 6)>

7. Node 6: Node 6 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 9), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7: Node 7 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 6), so it can form 1 3-star. <7, (1, 3, 6)>

9. Node 8: Node 8 has 1 neighbor (node 0), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

10. Node 9: Node 9 has 2 neighbors (nodes 0, 6), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
