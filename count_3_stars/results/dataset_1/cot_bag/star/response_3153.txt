Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the given edge information:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [0]
- Node 2: [3C3 = 1]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 5: [0]
- Node 6: [3C3 = 1]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [3C3 = 1]
- Node 9: [0]

Total number of 3-stars = [0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0] = [2]

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (8, 4, 9)>
