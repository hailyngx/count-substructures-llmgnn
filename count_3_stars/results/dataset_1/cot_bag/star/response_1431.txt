Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll look at each node that has three or more neighbors.

1. Node 0: Node 0 has 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
2. Node 2: Node 2 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 5, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
3. Node 5: Node 5 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 6, 7). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
4. Node 6: Node 6 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 7). Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
5. Node 7: Node 7 has 4 neighbors (nodes 4, 5, 6, 9). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
6. Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 9). Therefore, there is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center.
7. Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 7, 8). Therefore, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 28 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>.
