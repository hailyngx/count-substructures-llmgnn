Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 5 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 4 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
