Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 9, 1
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 8

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
