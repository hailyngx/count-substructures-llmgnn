Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star with three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (Degree: 6)
- Node 1: 0, 3, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 3: 1 (Degree: 1)
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8, 9 (Degree: 4)
- Node 6: 2, 9 (Degree: 2)
- Node 7: 0, 9 (Degree: 2)
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5 (Degree: 3)
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 (Degree: 6)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:
- Node 0 can form 3-stars with (1, 4, 5), (1, 8, 9), (4, 5, 9), (4, 8, 9), (5, 8, 9). Total: 5
- Node 2 can form 3-stars with (4, 5, 8), (4, 5, 9). Total: 2
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with (0, 5, 9). Total: 1
- Node 5 can form 3-stars with (0, 8, 9). Total: 1
- Node 8 cannot form a 3-star with its neighbors.
- Node 9 can form 3-stars with (0, 4, 5), (0, 6, 7). Total: 2

Adding up all these combinations, we have a total of 11 3-stars inside brackets []:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>
