Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: {4, 7}
Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
Node 4: {1, 2, 7}
Node 5: {7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6}
Node 9: {0, 3, 5}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1: no 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: no 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7
Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
