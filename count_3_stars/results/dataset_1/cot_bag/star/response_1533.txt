Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are 6, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at node 6.

For node 6, the possible 3-stars are:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]
Each combination of 3 neighbors of node 6 forms a unique 3-star. Therefore, within node 6, there are 20 unique 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we have a total of [20] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
