Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 7, 8}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 21. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
