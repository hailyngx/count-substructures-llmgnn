Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
The neighbors of node 0 are 2, 3, and 4. So, there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 3, 4)>.

For node 1:
The neighbors of node 1 are 2, 5, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 5, 7)>.

For node 2:
The neighbors of node 2 are 0, 1, 3, and 5. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>.

For node 3:
The neighbors of node 3 are 0, 2, 4, and 5. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>.

For node 4:
The neighbors of node 4 are 0, 3, 5, and 6. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>.

For node 5:
The neighbors of node 5 are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>.

For node 6:
The neighbors of node 6 are 4, 7, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (4, 7, 8)>.

For node 7:
The neighbors of node 7 are 1, 3, 6, and 9. So, there are 4 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 23.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>.
