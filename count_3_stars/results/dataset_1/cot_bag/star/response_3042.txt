Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 3), (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Now, let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:

Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph can be represented as: 
\[ [20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [23] \]

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>
