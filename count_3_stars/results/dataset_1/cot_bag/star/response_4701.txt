Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 5, 6
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 8, 9
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6
Node 6 has 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 61 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [61].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
