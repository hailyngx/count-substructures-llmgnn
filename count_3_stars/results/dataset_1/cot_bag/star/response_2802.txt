Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 
Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:  

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 9. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

Node 2 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>
Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>

Adding them up, we have a total of [22] 3-stars.
