Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
