Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 35 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
