Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 9
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 4, 9)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (3, 4, 5)
- Node 4: 5 3-stars (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 3), (4, 1, 3), (4, 3, 5), (4, 3, 6)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 5 + 1] = 8.
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (4, 9, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 0, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>.
