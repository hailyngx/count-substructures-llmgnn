Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 7
Node 3: 1, 4
Node 4: 3, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8
Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 6

From the list above, we can see that nodes 1, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
...

For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 5)>
<6, (1, 8, 5)>
<6, (1, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
...

For Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 5)>
<8, (1, 7, 5)>
...

There are in total 20 + 10 + 10 = 40 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [40].
