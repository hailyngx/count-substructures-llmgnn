Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up these results: 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
