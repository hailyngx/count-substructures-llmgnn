Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

The nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [36].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 9, 1>
- <2, 0, 4>
- <3, 1, 7>
- <5, 9, 8>
- <7, 5, 8>
- <7, 9, 8>
- <8, 7, 9>
