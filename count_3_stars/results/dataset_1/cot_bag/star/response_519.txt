Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph to visualize it.  

Now let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors  
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors  
  
Next, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
\( \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 8 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [8].   

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (2, 3, 6)>  
<0, (2, 6, 8)>  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<0, (3, 6, 8)>  
<9, (4, 7, 8)>  
<9, (4, 7, 7)>  
<9, (4, 8, 8)>  
<9, (7, 7, 8)>
