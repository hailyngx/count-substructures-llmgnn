Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7: 1, 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

To count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31.

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in this graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 5)>
