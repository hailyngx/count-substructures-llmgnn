Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 9}
- Node 5: {2}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {2, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with {6, 8, 9} and this gives \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with {5, 6, 7} and this also gives \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with {1, 2, 8}, {1, 2, 9}, {1, 8, 9}, {2, 8, 9}. This gives \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
