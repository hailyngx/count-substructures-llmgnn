Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then we can calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form. 

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 58 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
