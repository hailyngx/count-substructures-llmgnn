Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify how many neighbors each node has:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors (4, 5)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (2)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (2, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (4, 5)

There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4, which we represent as [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
