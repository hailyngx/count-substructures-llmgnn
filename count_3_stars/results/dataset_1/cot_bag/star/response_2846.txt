Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 --- 3 --- 1
    |     |     |
    4     5     8
     \         
       9          
```

There are four nodes with three or more neighbors (0, 3, 4, and 8). We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 4 + 0] = [9]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 0, 5)>, <4, (3, 9, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>
