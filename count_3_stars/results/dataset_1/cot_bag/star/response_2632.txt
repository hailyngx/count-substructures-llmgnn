Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2 has neighbors {3, 4}
- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 2, 9}
- Node 4 has neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 7 has neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} + inom{3}{3} = 2 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 11, so [11].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
