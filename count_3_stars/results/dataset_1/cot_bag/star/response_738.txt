Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. 

Now, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9: \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [19]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <1, 0, 4>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 0, 1>
- <4, 3, 5>
- <4, 3, 8>
- <4, 3, 9>
- <5, 3, 4>
- <5, 4, 9>
- <8, 3, 4>
- <9, 3, 4>
- <9, 4, 5>
