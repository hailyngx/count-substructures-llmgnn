Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4: 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 5, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 6, which we represent as [6].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
