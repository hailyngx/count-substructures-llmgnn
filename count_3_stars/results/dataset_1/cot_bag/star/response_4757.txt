Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
  1 -- 8
 /      |
7 - 0 - 2 - 3
|       | /
5 - 6 - 4
      /
     9
```

To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 34 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 34.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
