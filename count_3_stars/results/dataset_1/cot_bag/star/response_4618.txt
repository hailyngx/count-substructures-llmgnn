Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 6) 
(1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7) 
(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9) 
(3, 2), (3, 4) 
(4, 3), (4, 7) 
(5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9) 
(6, 0) 
(7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5) 
(8, 9) 
(9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For each node that has 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it's part of:

Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10  
<2, (0, 1, 3)>  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (0, 3, 5)>  
<2, (1, 3, 5)>  
<2, (1, 5, 9)>  
<2, (3, 4, 9)>  
<2, (4, 5, 7)>  
<2, (4, 7, 9)>  
<2, (5, 7, 9)>  
<2, (0, 5, 9)>

Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>  
<5, (1, 7, 9)>  
<5, (2, 7, 9)>  
<5, (4, 7, 9)>

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, we have: 
[10 + 4 = 14]  
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
