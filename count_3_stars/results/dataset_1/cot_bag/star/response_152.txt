Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. 
Looking at the given edges, we can see that nodes 0 and 8 have three neighbors each, while all other nodes have fewer.

For node 0:
Node 0 forms 3-stars with its three neighbors 1, 5, and 8. Thus, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for node 0.

For node 8:
Node 8 forms 3-stars with its three neighbors 0, 3, and 4. Thus, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for node 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([1 + 1] = 2\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)> 

So, putting the final number inside brackets we have: \([2]\).
