Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3

The nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 have at least 3 neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

In total, there are [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<1, 5, 8>
<5, 1, 7>
<7, 1, 4>
<7, 1, 8>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 6, 8>
