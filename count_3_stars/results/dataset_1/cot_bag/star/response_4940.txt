Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node for easier visualization:

- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4
- Node 9: 5, 6

Now we'll identify nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for the formation of 3-stars:

- Node 1, 2, 4, and 5 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <1, (2, 4, 6)>

- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
  <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, 
  <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, 
  <2, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (2, 4, 7)>,
  <2, (2, 1, 4)>, <2, (2, 1, 6)>, <2, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (2, 4, 8)>,
  <2, (2, 1, 6)>, <2, (2, 1, 4)>, <2, (2, 1, 6)>, <2, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
  <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 8, 2)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (8, 2, 5)>

- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
  <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Add up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 26

Thus, there are 26 3-stars in this graph:
