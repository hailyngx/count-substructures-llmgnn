Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {5, 6, 7}
Node 1: {6, 8, 9}
Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {2, 7, 8}
Node 4: {5, 8}
Node 5: {0, 2, 4}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 6, 8}
Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 8}

For the calculation of the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 4 each have 3 neighbors, so each can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 9 each have more than 3 neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{k}{3} \) for these nodes, where k is the number of neighbors for each node.
  
Calculating \( \binom{k}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is: 
1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) + 10 (from Node 7) + 4 (from Node 9) = 28 

Therefore, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
