Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 2, 3, 6, 8.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:
1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 25 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
