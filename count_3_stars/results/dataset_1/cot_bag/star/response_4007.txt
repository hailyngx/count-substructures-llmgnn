Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors: {3, 4, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: {0, 2, 5, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 10] = [14] \).

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>.
