Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with at least 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:
1. Node 0: There are 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. 
2. Node 1: There are 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4), so it can form 1 3-star. 
3. Node 3: There are 6 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9), so it can form 20 3-stars.
4. Node 4: There are 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 9), so it can form 4 3-stars.
5. Node 6: There are 2 neighbors (3, 8), so it cannot form any 3-star.
6. Node 7: There is 1 neighbor (3), so it cannot form any 3-star.
7. Node 8: There is 1 neighbor (6), so it cannot form any 3-star.
8. Node 9: There are 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4), so it can form 1 3-star. 

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of [26].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 4>
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
