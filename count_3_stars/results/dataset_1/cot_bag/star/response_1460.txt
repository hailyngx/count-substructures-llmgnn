Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are four nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star 
- For node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star 
- For node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star 
- For node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star 

Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
