Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors first:

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6
Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 9
Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 3
Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 6, 7
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 5, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 5, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 6
Node 9 has neighbors: 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star
Node 3 forms 1 3-star
Node 5 forms 1 3-star
Node 7 forms 1 3-star

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
