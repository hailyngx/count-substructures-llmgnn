Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
  0 ---- 5 ---- 1 ---- 8
  |     /|      |      |
  |    / |      |      |
  |   /  |      |      |
  |  /   |      |      |
  4 ---- 2 ---- 7 ---- 3
        | \    /|      |
        |  \  / |      |
        |   \/  |      |
        |   /\  |      |
        9 -- 6 - -9     
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 1)>, <5, (4, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 2)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (5, 7, 1)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars from the above combinations, we get [18].
