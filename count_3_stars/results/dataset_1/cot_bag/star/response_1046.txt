Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 4, and node 9.

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors (2, 3, 4). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center.
<0, (2, 3, 4)>

For node 4:
There are 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7, 8). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 9:
There are 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 7, 9). So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
<9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 10 + 10] = 21.
