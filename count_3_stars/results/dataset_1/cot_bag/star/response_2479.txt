Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges.

The graph has the following nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4
- Node 3 is connected to node 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 7 is connected to node 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 6

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 2)>
Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 6)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 8)>
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (1, 8)>

Putting all these unique 3-stars together, we have [5] unique 3-stars in this graph.
