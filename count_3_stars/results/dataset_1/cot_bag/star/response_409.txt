Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors: nodes 3, 5, and 7. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 5, 7), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8), so there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 8), so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 1 + 10 = 21, so the final answer is [21].
