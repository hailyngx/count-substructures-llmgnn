Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: [0]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [3]
- Node 3: [0]
- Node 4: [0]
- Node 6: [0]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [3]
- Node 9: [3]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 3  = 11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 1, 9)>
- <2, (7, 9, 1)>
- <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 4, 3)>
- <8, (3, 0, 4)>
- <8, (3, 4, 0)>
- <8, (4, 0, 3)>
- <8, (4, 3, 0)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <9, (0, 3, 2)>
- <9, (2, 0, 3)>
- <9, (2, 3, 0)>
- <9, (3, 0, 2)>
- <9, (3, 2, 0)>
