Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges:

```
    0 -- 4 -- 1 -- 6
    |    / | \   |   
    |   /  |  \  |   
    7  8   2   3  9
     \ |  / \      
      \| /   \
        5 --- |
```

Now, we need to identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to find the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes gives us the following number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 19

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <8, (4, 1, 6)>
- <8, (4, 2, 6)>
