Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9. Hence, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7. Hence, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>

So, the final answer is [26]. Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>
