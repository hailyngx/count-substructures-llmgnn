Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
