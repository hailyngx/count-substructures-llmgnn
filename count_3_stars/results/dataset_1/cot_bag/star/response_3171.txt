Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Following the approach outlined earlier:
- Node 0 can form 1 three-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 three-star.
- Node 5 can form 3 three-stars.
- Node 7 can form 1 three-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 three-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
