Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 0: There are 3 neighbors, so 1 3-star is formed. 
For node 1: There are 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed. 
For node 2: There are 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed. 
For node 5: There are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed.
For node 6: There are 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars are formed.
For node 8: There are 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed.
For node 9: There are 5 neighbors, so \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars are formed.

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 39

So, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>,
<5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>,
<6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>,
<8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>
