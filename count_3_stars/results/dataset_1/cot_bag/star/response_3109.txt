Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 2, 6)> (1 3-star)

For node 4:
- <4, (1, 2, 9)> (1 3-star)

For node 6:
- <6, (3, 5, 8)> (1 3-star)
- <6, (3, 8, 9)> (1 3-star)

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars found: <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>
