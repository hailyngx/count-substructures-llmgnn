Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 1 neighbor
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 22

Therefore, the graph has a total of [22] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
