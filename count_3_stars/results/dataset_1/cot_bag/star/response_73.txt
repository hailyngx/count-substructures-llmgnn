Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 3-stars
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 7, 8>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 8, 9>
- <8, 9, 0>
- <8, 9, 4>
- <8, 9, 5>
- <9, 0, 7>
- <9, 0, 8>
- <9, 4, 8>
- <9, 5, 8>
- <7, 0, 8>
- <8, 0, 7>
- <7, 1, 8>
- <8, 1, 7>
- <7, 1, 9>
