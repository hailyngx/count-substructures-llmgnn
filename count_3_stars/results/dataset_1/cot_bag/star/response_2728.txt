Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [23].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 1, 2)>
<0, (8, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<4, (8, 0, 9)>
<7, (3, 0, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<7, (6, 2, 9)>
<7, (8, 4, 9)>
