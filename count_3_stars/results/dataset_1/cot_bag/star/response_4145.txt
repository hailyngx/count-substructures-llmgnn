Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8. 
Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1, there are edges with nodes 3, 5, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 5, 8)>.

For node 2, there are edges with nodes 3, 5, and 7. So, there is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (3, 5, 7)>.

For node 3, there are edges with nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center. Listing them: 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>,  <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>.

For node 4, there are edges with nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center. Listing them: 
<4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>.

For node 5, there are edges with nodes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center. Listing them: 
<5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>, <5, (8, 9, 5)>, <5, (9, 7, 5)>.

For node 7, there are edges with nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center. Listing a few:
<7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>.

For node 8, there are edges with nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. So, there are \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center. Listing a few:
<8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35 = 81 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [81].
