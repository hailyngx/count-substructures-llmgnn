Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 33

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [33].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>

- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
