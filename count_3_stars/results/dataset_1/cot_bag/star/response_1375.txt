Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node:
Node 0: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 6
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 3

We can see that nodes 3 and 4 have 5 and 6 neighbors respectively, so they are potential centers of 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 (from node 3) + 20 (from node 4) = 30, which we will put inside brackets: [30].
Now, we will list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
