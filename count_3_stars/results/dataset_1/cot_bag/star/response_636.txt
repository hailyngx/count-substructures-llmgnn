Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 -- 1 -- 8
    |    |    |  
    5 -- 4 -- 3
         |
         6
         |
         9
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 9). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1: This node has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 8). Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: This node has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9). Thus, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4: This node has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6). Therefore, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5: This node has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 8). So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: This node has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5). Thus, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: This node has 2 neighbors (0, 3), which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 8) = 9.  
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, 1, 5>  
<1, 0, 5>  
<3, 4, 8>  
<4, 3, 6>  
<5, 0, 1>  
<5, 0, 4>  
<5, 1, 4>  
<5, 1, 8>  
<5, 4, 8>
