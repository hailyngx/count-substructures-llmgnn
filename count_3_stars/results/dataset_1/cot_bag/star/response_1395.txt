Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph first:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: [(0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 9), (9, 6), (9, 8)]

Now let's analyze the nodes:

- Node 0: It has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1: It has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3: It has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4: It has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7: It has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8: It has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 5 and node 7 both have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate \( \binom{4}{3} \) for each of them.
- Node 7 specifically forms 5 unique 3-stars.
- Node 5 specifically forms 4 unique 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 5 + 4 = 9 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (3, 5, 4)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 3)>
- <7, (5, 6, 4)>
- <7, (3, 5, 7)>
