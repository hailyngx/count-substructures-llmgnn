Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {4, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>
Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 0)>
Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>
Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (6, 5, 9)>
Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Counting all 3-stars, we have [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [30].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 0)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, 
<8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (6, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>
