Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8), so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 9), so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9), so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 7), so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9), so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5), so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars from these nodes, we get a total of 6 3-stars. So the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
1. <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <5, (1, 7, 9)>
6. <9, (1, 2, 5)>
