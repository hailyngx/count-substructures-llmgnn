Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 20

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>
