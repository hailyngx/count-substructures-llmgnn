Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9

Now let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 20 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 20.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>. 

So, the final answer is [20].
