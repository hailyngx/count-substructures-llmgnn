Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges:

```
    0 --- 1       3 --- 4
    |     |       |     |
    5 --- 8 --- 7 |     |
            |     |     |
            6     |
                  |
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of them:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars from nodes with three or more neighbors, we get 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, and <8, (3, 4, 5)>.
