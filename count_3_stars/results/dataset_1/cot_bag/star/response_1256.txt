Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 3), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 7, 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 7, 8. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 6. So, it does not form a 3-star.
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 5. So, it does not form a 3-star.
Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2. So, it forms 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: [4]

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>
