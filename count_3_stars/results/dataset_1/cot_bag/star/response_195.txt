Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: (8)
- Node 1: (6)
- Node 2: (6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: (6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (6)
- Node 6: (1, 2, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (2, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 8: (0, 2, 9)
- Node 9: (4, 7, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].
The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, 6, 7, 8>
- <4, 6, 7, 9>
