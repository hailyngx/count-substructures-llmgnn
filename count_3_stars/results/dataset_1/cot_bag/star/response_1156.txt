Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 8, 9
Node 1: 3, 8
Node 2: 0, 6
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 4: 3
Node 6: 2, 9
Node 7: 3, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 7
Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>.
