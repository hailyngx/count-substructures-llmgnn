Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
(0, 5), (5, 0)
(2, 5), (5, 2)
(2, 6), (6, 2)
(3, 4), (4, 3)
(3, 6), (6, 3)
(3, 7), (7, 3)
(3, 9), (9, 3)
(4, 8), (8, 4)
(5, 6), (6, 5)
(6, 8), (8, 6)
(6, 9), (9, 6)
(7, 8), (8, 7)
(8, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

We see that nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: No 3-star (has exactly 3 neighbors)
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing all the 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
