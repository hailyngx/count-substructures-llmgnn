Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Calculating the 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 22

Therefore, there are [22] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 4)>.
