Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: {7}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph: 
For node 2: 1 3-star
For node 3: 1 3-star
For node 4: 1 3-star
For node 5: 1 3-star
For node 6: 1 3-star
For node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 6

So, the final answer is [6] with the unique 3-stars as follows: 
<2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
