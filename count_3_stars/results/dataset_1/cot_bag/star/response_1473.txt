Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: has 6 neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: has 3 neighbors {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors {0, 2, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are 26 3-stars in the given graph. Listing them in the <> format:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>
