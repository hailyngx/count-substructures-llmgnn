Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are multiple nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors. Let's identify those nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>
