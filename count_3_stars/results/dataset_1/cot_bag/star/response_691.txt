Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are:
- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, which results in \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 also has 4 neighbors, which gives us another \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, resulting in 1 3-star.
Therefore, there are \( [4 + 4 + 1] = [9] \) 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
