Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars. 

Starting with node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7. This forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 7)>.

Moving on to node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Looking at node 2:
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. This forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>.

Examining node 3:
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Checking node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. This forms one 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 9)>.

Investigating node 5:
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 7)> and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.

Looking at node 6:
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Examining node 7:
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5. This forms one 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 5)>.

Checking node 8:
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Finally, node 9:
Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Putting it all together:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
