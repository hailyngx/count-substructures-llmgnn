Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- So, <0, (3, 6, 8)> is the 3-star with node 0 as the center.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, and 2.
- Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- So, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)> are the 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 2.
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- So, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)> are the 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 6.
- Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- So, <5, (2, 4, 6)> is the 3-star with node 5 as the center.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, and 7.
- Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- So, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)> are the 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

Adding up all the 3-stars we calculated:
1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 4) = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>.
