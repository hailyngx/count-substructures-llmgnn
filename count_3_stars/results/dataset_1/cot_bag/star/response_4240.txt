Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [4 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 10 \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
3. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
4. <0, (1, 2, 9)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 6)>
6. <7, (0, 3, 6)>
7. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
8. <7, (4, 6, 0)>
9. <9, (0, 2, 5)>
10. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
