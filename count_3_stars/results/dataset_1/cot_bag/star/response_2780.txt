Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 9), (7, 5), (8, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars around that node.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4
- Number of 3-stars around node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star around node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
- Node 1 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 5
- Node 2 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
- Number of 3-stars around node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star around node 3: <3, (0, 2, 4)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
- Number of 3-stars around node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star around node 4: <4, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 5 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 6 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 5
- Node 7 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 4
- Node 8 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 6
- Node 9 does not have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Putting all the unique 3-stars together, we have:
[<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3. The final result is [3].
