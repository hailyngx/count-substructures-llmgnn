Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 7

Node 1, 3, and 6 have three or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 = 15

So, there are 15 3-stars in this graph. Listing them uniquely:

[15]
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 3, 6)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (6, 3, 2)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 1)>, <3, (2, 6, 4)>, <3, (4, 6, 1)>, <3, (4, 6, 2)>, <3, (4, 2, 6)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (6, 2, 4)>, <3, (6, 4, 2)>
