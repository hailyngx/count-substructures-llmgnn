Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and then sum them up:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (4 3-stars can be formed)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 2)>
