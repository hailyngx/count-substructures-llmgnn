Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
We have connections with nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars involving node 0 would be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 1: 
We have connections with nodes 4, 5, and 8. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars involving node 1 would be \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 3: 
We have connections with nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars involving node 3 would be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 4: 
We have connections with nodes 0, 1, and 2. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars involving node 4 would be \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).

For node 7: 
We have connections with nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars involving node 7 would be \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node gives us a total of 14 3-stars. So, the answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
