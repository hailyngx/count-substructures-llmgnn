Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
