Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 6, 9. 
Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 8.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 3, 9.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 9. 
Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 9.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 0.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 3. 
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 3: [1]
Node 9: [1]

Summing up all the 3-stars gives: [4]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 9>
<2, 3, 9> 
<3, 2, 9>
<9, 0, 2>
