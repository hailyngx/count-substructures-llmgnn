Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the nodes, we have a total of \(10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 56\) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 2, 8, 9>
- <0, 5, 8, 9>
- <0, 6, 2, 8>
- <0, 6, 7, 8>
- <0, 6, 8, 9>
- <0, 8, 1, 9>
- <0, 8, 2, 5>
- <0, 8, 2, 9>
- <0, 8, 4, 5>
- <0, 8, 4, 6>
- <0, 8, 5, 9>
- <0, 8, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 8, 9>
- <2, 6, 7, 8>
- <2, 6, 8, 9>
- <2, 8, 5, 9>
- <6, 7, 3, 9>
- <8, 1, 9, 3>
- <8, 4, 5, 9>

- <8, 6, 0, 9>
