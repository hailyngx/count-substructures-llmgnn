Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the provided information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: [(0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)]

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

So, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
