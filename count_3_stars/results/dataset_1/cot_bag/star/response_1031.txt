Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 2: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars
- Node 8: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star
- Node 9: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: $4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 15$

Therefore, there are 15 3-stars in this graph. Listing the unique 3-stars:
