Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, we have a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 0)>
