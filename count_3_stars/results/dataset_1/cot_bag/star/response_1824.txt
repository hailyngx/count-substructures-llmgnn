Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 2, 5
Node 1: 2, 4, 6
Node 2: 0, 1
Node 3: 5, 8
Node 4: 1, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 6: 1, 5
Node 8: 3, 4
Node 9: 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 0: 1 3-star
Node 1: 3 3-stars
Node 3: 3 3-stars
Node 4: 6 3-stars
Node 5: 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 10] = [23]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 3)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<6, (1, 5, 3)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 0)>
<8, (4, 9, 1)>
<8, (4, 9, 3)>
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
<8, (4, 9, 7)>
<9, (4, 8, 1)>
