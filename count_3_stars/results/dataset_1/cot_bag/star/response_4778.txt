Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are 0, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

For node 0, we can form 4 3-stars: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>.

For node 4, we can form 6 3-stars: <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>.

For node 6, we can form 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>.

For node 7, we can form 4 3-stars: <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>.

For node 8, we can form 2 3-stars: <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>.

Adding these up, we have a total of [4 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 2] = [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
