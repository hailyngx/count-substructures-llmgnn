Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 6  
- 1 is connected to 5  
- 2 is connected to 6, 8  
- 4 is connected to 6, 7, 8, 9  
- 5 is connected to 1, 6, 7, 9  
- 6 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9  
- 7 is connected to 4, 5, 9  
- 8 is connected to 2, 4, 6  
- 9 is connected to 4, 5, 6, 7  

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 32

So, the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
