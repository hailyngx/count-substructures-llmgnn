Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 8.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 7.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 8, and 9.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 4.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Combining these results, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = 16 \).

The unique 3-stars formed are:

<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
