Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 3, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 1, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Each of the nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9 has at least 3 neighbors, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

Calculating the numbers of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
