Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph formed by the nodes in this graph is as follows:

- For node 0: [1] (0, 4, 8)
- For node 4: [1] (4, 0, 3)
- For node 5: [2] (5, 1, 3), (5, 4, 7)
- For node 6: [1] (6, 1, 2)
- For node 7: [1] (7, 5, 9)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
