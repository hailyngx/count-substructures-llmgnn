Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (3, 4, 7, 9) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (3, 6) -> 0 3-stars
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (4, 9) -> 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7) -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (0, 2) -> 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (3, 9) -> 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 neighbor (1) -> 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (0, 3) -> 1 3-star
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5) -> 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
