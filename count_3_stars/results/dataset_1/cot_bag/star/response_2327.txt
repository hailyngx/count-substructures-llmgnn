Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 3), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8
This forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
<3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 8, 6
This forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
<5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 6)>, <5, (6, 8, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 8
This forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
<6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
