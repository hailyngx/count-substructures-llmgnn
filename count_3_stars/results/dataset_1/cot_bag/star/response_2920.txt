Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the edges are listed. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 6, 9
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 9
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 forms 1 3-star
Node 4 forms 1 3-star
Node 7 forms 1 3-star
Node 8 forms 4 3-stars
Node 9 forms 4 3-stars

\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [11] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 9)>
