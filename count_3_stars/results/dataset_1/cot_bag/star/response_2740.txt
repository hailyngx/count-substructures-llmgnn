Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The 3-stars formed by each node are:

- Node 0: [<0, (2, 8)>]
- Node 2: [<2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>]
- Node 3: [<3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>]
- Node 4: [<4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 9, 7)>]
- Node 6: [<6, (3, 4, 5)>]
- Node 7: [<7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 9, 4)>]
- Node 9: [<9, (3, 5, 7)>]

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [11].
