Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

For node 0, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
For node 1, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
For node 3, there are ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars.
For node 4, there are ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star.
For node 8, there are ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star.
For node 9, there are ${2 \choose 3} = 0$ 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0] = 14

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
