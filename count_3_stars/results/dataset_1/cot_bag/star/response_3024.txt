Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 2. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 0. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 9. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 8. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
