Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Let's analyze the nodes to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (1 and 5).
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 8, 0).
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6) so it forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 6).
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7) so it forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 7).
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 8, 0) so it forms two 3-stars with nodes (0, 2, 8) and (0, 3, 8).

The total number of 3-stars is 3, found as follows:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 + 1 = 2 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (2, 8, 5)>
- <0, (3, 8, 5)>
