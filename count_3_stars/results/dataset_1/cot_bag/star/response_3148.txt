Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the degrees of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 1
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 8

Therefore, nodes with at least 3 neighbors are nodes 1, 4, and 9. 

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 56 (from node 9) = 58

So, the total number of 3-stars is [58].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

<9, (1, 3, 7)>
