Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the nodes and their connections visually:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 6 and 9
- 1 is connected to 3, 4, 5, and 8
- 2 is connected to 4 and 7
- 3 is connected to 1, 8, and 9
- 4 is connected to 1, 2, and 5
- 5 is connected to 1, 4, and 7
- 6 is connected to 0 and 8
- 7 is connected to 2, 5, and 8
- 8 is connected to 1, 3, 6, and 7
- 9 is connected to 0 and 3

Now let's identify the central nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 7)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 7)

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11] and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 1)>.
