Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the number of 3-stars from each node: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>,
<7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>,
<7, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>.
