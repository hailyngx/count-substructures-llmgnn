Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of possible 3-stars that can be formed with it.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$
- Node 1: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- Node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$

Total number of 3-stars: $20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32$

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [32].
