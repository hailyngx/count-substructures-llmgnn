Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9} (6 neighbors)
- Node 1: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 1, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 40 3-stars. 

Inside brackets []: [40]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (8, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
