Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 6
- Number of 3-stars for node 0 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star for node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
- Number of 3-stars for node 2 = 0

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- Number of 3-stars for node 4 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star for node 4: <4, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
- Number of 3-stars for node 5 = 0

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Number of 3-stars for node 6 = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars for node 7 = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star for node 7: <7, (4, 6, 8)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 5, 7
- Number of 3-stars for node 8 = 0

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>.
