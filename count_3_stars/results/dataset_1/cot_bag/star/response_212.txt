Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as pairs of connected nodes. 

Let's analyze the nodes to determine which nodes are part of a 3-star structure:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor (insufficient for a 3-star).
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (insufficient for a 3-star).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (insufficient for a 3-star).
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor (insufficient for a 3-star).
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 4 + 4 + 20] = [32] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <0, (7, 2, 9)>
- <0, (9, 7, 2)>
- <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (7, 0, 9)>
- <2, (7, 9, 0)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 0, 9)>
- <7, (2, 9, 0)>
- <7, (9, 0, 2)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (0, 7, 2)>
- <9, (2, 0, 7)>
- <9, (2, 7, 0)>
- <9, (7, 0, 2)>
- <9, (7, 2, 0)>
- <9, (5, 6, 9)>
