Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors. Number of 3-star graphs with 0 as the center = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \), <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-star graphs with 1 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-star graphs with 3 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors. Number of 3-star graphs with 4 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \), <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors. Only 1 3-star graph with 5 as the center, <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors. Only 1 3-star graph with 9 as the center, <9, (1, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 24.
So, the final result is [24].
