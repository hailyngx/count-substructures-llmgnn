Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 9, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, and 6, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, and 9, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, and 9, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, and 9, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, and 7, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 5) + 4 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 15

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>
