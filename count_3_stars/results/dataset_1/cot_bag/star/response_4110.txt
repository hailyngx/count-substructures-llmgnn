Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6. So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7. So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 6, 7. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 8. So, it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. 
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9. So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 6, 9. It cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 8. So, it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
