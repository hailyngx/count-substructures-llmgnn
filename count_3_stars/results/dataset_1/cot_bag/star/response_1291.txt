Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5)]

Since we need to find the total number of 3-stars, let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars are formed:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars involving this node.
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars involving this node.
- Node 2: 6 neighbors, so there are 20 3-stars involving this node.
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star involving this node.
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars involving this node.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star involving this node.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars involving this node.
- Node 7: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star involving this node.
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star involving this node.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars involving this node.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 55

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 1, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>
