Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  (exactly 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
