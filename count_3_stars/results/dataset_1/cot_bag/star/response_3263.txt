Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with degree 3 or more: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

For node 0: 
- 3-star count: ${1 \choose 3} = 0$

For node 3: 
- 3-star count: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 5: 
- 3-star count: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 6: 
- 3-star count: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- 3-stars: <6, (3, 4, 5)>

For node 7: 
- 3-star count: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 8: 
- 3-star count: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
- 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>

For node 9: 
- 3-star count: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$
- 3-stars: <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18]. The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>.
