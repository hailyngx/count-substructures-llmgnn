Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 7 nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4:  \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9:  \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 14 in total, so the final answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
