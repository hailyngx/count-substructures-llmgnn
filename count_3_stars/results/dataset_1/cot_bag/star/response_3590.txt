Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives [4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [14].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>
