Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 = 11.

List of unique 3-stars:
<[1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 6], [1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 8]>
