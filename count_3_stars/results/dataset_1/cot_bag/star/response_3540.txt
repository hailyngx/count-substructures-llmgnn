Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 4 neighbors: node 2, node 3, and node 4. 

For node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <<2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 9, 0)>, <2, (0, 4, 3)>, <2, (4, 9, 3)>>

For node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <<3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>>

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12].
