Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 45

Thus, the final answer is [45].
