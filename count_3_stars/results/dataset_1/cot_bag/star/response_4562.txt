Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, it is clear that the nodes in the graph have the following neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Next, we need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars. From the list above, nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed from each of these nodes:
- Node 0:  1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4:  1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of [6].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 7)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6)>
- <6, (4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
