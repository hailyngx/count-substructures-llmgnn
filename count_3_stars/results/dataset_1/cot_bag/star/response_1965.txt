Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first note that nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, making them potential centers for 3-stars. Let's now calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these potential central nodes:

- Node 1: Nodes 7, 8, and 9 are connected to node 1, forming one 3-star. So, we have \( 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: Nodes 2 and 9 are connected to node 5, but these nodes are also connected to other nodes, making them ineligible for 3-stars around node 5.
- Node 6: Nodes 2, 7, and 8 are connected to node 6, forming one 3-star. So, we have \( 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: Nodes 1, 3, and 9 are connected to node 8, forming one 3-star. So, we have \( 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9: Nodes 1, 5, and 8 are connected to node 9, forming one 3-star. So, we have \( 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars formed by the potential central nodes, we have a total of \( \text{[} 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \text{]} = 5 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( \text{[} 5 \text{]} = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
