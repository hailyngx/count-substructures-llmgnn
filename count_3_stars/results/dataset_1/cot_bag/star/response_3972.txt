Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are a part of:

- Node 0 is connected to 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>

- Node 3 is connected to 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>

- Node 4 is connected to 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>

- Node 6 is connected to 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>

- Node 9 is connected to 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7
  - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>,
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>,
<4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>,
<6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>,
<9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>
