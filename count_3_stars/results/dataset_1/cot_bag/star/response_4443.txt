Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 2), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7)
- Total 3-stars: [1]

<0, (6, 7)>

Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 8)
- Total 3-stars: [1]

<1, (2, 3, 8)>

Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 5)
- Total 3-stars: [1]

<2, (1, 4, 5)>

Node 3: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 6)
- Total 3-stars: [1]

<3, (1, 4, 6)>

Node 4: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
- Total 3-stars: [0]

Node 5: 2 neighbors (2, 7)
- Total 3-stars: [0]

Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 7)
- Total 3-stars: [1]

<6, (0, 3, 7)>

Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8)
- Total 3-stars: [3]

<7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>

Node 8: 2 neighbors (1, 7)
- Total 3-stars: [0]

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [7]

So, the answer is [7].
