Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
- It has 2 neighbors: 3 and 9, so it does not form any 3-star.

For node 1:
- It has 6 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 8, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

For node 2:
- It has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 8, so it forms 1 3-star.

For nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9:
- They each have more than 3 neighbors, so they can form inom{n}{3} 3-stars, where n is the number of their neighbors.

Adding all the 3-stars together, we get a total of [20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 20] = [83] 3-stars.
