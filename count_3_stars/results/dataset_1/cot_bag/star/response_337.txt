Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 8, 9).
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8).
Node 3 has 2 neighbors (7, 8).
Node 4 has 2 neighbors (0, 5).
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 7).
Node 6 has 2 neighbors (7, 8).
Node 7 has 4 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 8).
Node 8 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 6, 7).
Node 9 has 1 neighbor (1).

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

So, the final answer is [20].
The unique 3-stars found are:
