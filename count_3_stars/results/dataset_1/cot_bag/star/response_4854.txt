Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5 

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 6 [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 6.
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>

So the final answer is [6].
