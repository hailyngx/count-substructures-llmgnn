Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and then calculate the number of 3-stars around each of them. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars).

Summing up the 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 26 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 4)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 4)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 1)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 5, 4)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 1)>, <7, (1, 6, 4)>, <7, (1, 5, 4)>.
