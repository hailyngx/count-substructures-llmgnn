Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: no 3-stars
- Node 1: no 3-stars
- Node 2: no 3-stars
- Node 3: <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: no 3-stars
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8: no 3-stars
- Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
