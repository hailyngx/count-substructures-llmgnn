Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:
- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Edges: 
    - (0, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 3), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 6)

Now, let's see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For Node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is: [12]

And the unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 2)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 1)>
