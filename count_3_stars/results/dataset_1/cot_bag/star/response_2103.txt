Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 4, 8)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (0, 6)
- Node 6: 2 neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
