Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, node 3, and node 6.

For node 0:
There are 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 8.
So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (4, 5, 8)>.

For node 2:
There are 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, and 8.
So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>.

For node 3:
There are 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 7.
So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (1, 6, 7)>.

For node 6:
There are 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 7.
So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [7] \).
