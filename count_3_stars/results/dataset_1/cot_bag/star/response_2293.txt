Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 6)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>.

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>.

3. Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9.
   - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   - Unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 8, 1)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 20 + 4 + 20 = 44.
Putting this final number inside brackets gives: [44].
