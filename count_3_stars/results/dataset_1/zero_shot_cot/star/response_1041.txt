Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (7, 8, 2)>
<3, (9, 9, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in the graph.
