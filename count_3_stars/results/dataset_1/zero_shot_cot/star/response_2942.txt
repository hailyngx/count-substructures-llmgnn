Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph:
- 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 26 edges: 
  (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) 
  (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) 
  (2, 6) 
  (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) 
  (4, 1) (4, 5) 
  (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) 
  (6, 2) (6, 3) 
  (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) 
  (8, 1) 
  (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

[Total number of 3-stars: 6]

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>
