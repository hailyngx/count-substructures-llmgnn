Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

Node 0 has 3 edges connected to it: (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9).  
Node 1 has 2 edges connected to it: (1, 4), (1, 9).  
Node 2 has 1 edge connected to it: (2, 9).  
Node 4 has 2 edges connected to it: (4, 1), (4, 7).  
Node 5 has 1 edge connected to it: (5, 9).  
Node 6 has 1 edge connected to it: (6, 0).  
Node 7 has 3 edges connected to it: (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9).  
Node 8 has 2 edges connected to it: (8, 0), (8, 7).  
Node 9 has 5 edges connected to it: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7).  

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.  
Counting the 3-stars:  
- 1 with center at node 0: <0, (6, 8, 9)>  
- 1 with center at node 7: <7, (4, 8, 9)>  
- 1 with center at node 9: <9, (0, 1, 2)>  
- 1 with center at node 4: <4, (1, 7, 9)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>
