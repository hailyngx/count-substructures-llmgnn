Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
