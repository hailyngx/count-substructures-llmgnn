Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- There is one 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 2, 7, and 9 as the leaves.
- There is one 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 0, 6, and 9 as the leaves.
- There is one 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 1, 3, and 5 as the leaves.
- There is one 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 0, 3, and 6 as the leaves.
- There is one 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 4, 5, and 7 as the leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
