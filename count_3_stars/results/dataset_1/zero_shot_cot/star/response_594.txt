Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars.

First, let's list all the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 9}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {8, 9}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 6)>
<1, (2, 7)>
<2, (1, 9)>
<4, (8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [6]
