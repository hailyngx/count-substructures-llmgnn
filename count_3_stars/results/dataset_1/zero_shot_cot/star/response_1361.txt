Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the given graph. 
The central nodes are the ones connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the central nodes are: 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's find all the possible 3-stars in the given graph. 
Starting with central node 2:
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (9, 7, 3)>

Moving on to central node 4:
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (9, 0, 6)>
- <4, (6, 5, 9)>
- <4, (6, 2, 9)>

For central node 6:
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (8, 7, 2)>
- <6, (8, 7, 9)>

For central node 7:
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (9, 1, 8)>
- <7, (9, 8, 2)>

Finally, for central node 9:
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (4, 5, 7)>
- <9, (5, 9, 7)>
- <9, (7, 8, 2)>
- <9, (7, 8, 4)>
- <9, (7, 2, 5)>
- <9, (7, 2, 9)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <4, (6, 5, 9)>, <4, (6, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (8, 7, 2)>, <6, (8, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (9, 1, 8)>, <7, (9, 8, 2)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 9, 7)>, <9, (7, 8, 2)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>.
