Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star structures can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8.  
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8.  
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6.  
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6.  
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5.  
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7.  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
