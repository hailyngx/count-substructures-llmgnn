Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Then we can count the number of such 3-stars.

Let's first list out all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 2, and 4.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [2].
