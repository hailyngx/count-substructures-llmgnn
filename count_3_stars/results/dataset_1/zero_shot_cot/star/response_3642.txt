Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes (nodes connected to exactly three other nodes). Let's start by listing all 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>

By going through the given graph, we can see that these are all the 3-stars present in the graph. Counting them, we get a total of [6].
