Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
5. <8, (2, 5, 6)>
6. <2, (8, 9, -)>
7. <9, (2, 3, -)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
