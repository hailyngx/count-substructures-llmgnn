Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 

- Node 0 has neighbors 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 has neighbors 6 and 9.
- Node 2 has neighbor 9.
- Node 3 has neighbor 5.
- Node 4 has neighbor 5.
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbor 5.
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

There are 4 possible central nodes: 0, 1, 7, and 9.

For central node 0:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>

For central node 1:
- <1, (6, 9, 5)>

For central node 7:
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>

For central node 9:
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
