Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (3, 6, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
5. <4, (7, 8, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 9)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (0, 4, 5)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
