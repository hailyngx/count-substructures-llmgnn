Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4.

2. Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
   - For each central node, we look at its connections to form 3-stars.
   - After examining all central nodes, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
