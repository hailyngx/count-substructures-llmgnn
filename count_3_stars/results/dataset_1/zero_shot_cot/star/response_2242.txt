Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that form a 3-star with the center node.
    
Node 1: (1, 4, 6, 7, 8)
Node 2: (2, 4, 9)
Node 3: (3, 8)
Node 4: (1, 2)
Node 5: (5, 6, 8, 9)
Node 6: (1, 5, 6, 9)
Node 7: (0, 1)
Node 8: (1, 3, 5)
Node 9: (2, 5, 6)

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: [6]

List of unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 9, 5)>, <3, (8)>, <4, (2, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 1, 9)>
