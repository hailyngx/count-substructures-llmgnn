Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of 3-stars. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 6 and 8 have exactly 3 neighbors each. This means they can act as the center of a 3-star. Let's list all unique 3-stars that can be formed:

1. <6, (1, 4, 9)>
2. <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
