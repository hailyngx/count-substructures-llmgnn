Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by examining each node and its adjacent nodes to see if they form a 3-star pattern. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars step-by-step:

1. For node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to node 1.
     - <0, (1, )>  (Incomplete star)

2. For node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.
     - <1, (0, 4, 7)> 
     - <1, (0, 8, 7)>
     - <1, (4, 0, 8)>
     - <1, (7, 0, 8)>
     - <1, (8, 0, 7)>

3. For node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
     - <3, (5, 8, )>  (Incomplete star)

4. For node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to node 1.
     - <4, (1, )>  (Incomplete star)

5. For node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to node 3.
     - <5, (3, )>  (Incomplete star)

6. For node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to node 8.
     - <6, (8, )>  (Incomplete star)

7. For node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
     - <7, (1, 8, )>  (Incomplete star)

8. For node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
     - <8, (1, 3, 7)>
     - <8, (1, 6, 7)>
     - <8, (3, 1, 6)>
     - <8, (7, 1, 3)>
     - <8, (7, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 7)>, <1, (4, 0, 8)>, <1, (7, 0, 8)>, <1, (8, 0, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, )>, <4, (1, )>, <5, (3, )>, <6, (8, )>, <7, (1, 8, )>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 1, 6)>.
