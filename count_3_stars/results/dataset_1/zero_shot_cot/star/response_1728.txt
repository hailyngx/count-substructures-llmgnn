Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central node in a 3-star graph has exactly 3 edges connected to it. From the given graph, the central nodes are 0, 1, 8, and 9.

Next, we need to identify the leaves (other nodes connected to the central node) for each central node. 
- For central node 0: (1, 2, 4, 6, 9)
- For central node 1: (0, 3, 7, 8, 9)
- For central node 8: (1, 5, 6, 9)
- For central node 9: (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For central node 0: there are 5 leaves, so we have 5 choose 3 = 10 unique 3-stars.
- For central node 1: there are 5 leaves, so we have 5 choose 3 = 10 unique 3-stars.
- For central node 8: there are 4 leaves, so we have 4 choose 3 = 4 unique 3-stars.
- For central node 9: there are 6 leaves, so we have 6 choose 3 = 20 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 44].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
