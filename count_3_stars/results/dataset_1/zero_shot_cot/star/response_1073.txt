Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3.

From the given edges, nodes 2, 3, and 8 have a degree of 3, making them potential center nodes for 3-stars. Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph. So, the final answer is [3].
