Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, we have the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 4, 3)>
<3, (8, 1, 4)>
<3, (9, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
