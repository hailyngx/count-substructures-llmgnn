Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, -)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 8)>
6. <5, (3, -, -)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 7)>
8. <7, (2, 6, 8)>
9. <8, (1, 2, 4)>
10. <9, (4, 7, -)>

Count of 3-stars: 10
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
