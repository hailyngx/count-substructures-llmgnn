Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 4)
4. Node 3: (3, 6, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 6)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 3, 4)
8. Node 7: (7, 5, 6)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 1)
10. Node 9: (9, 6) 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 8)> <1, (2, 8)> <2, (1, 4)> <3, (6, 8)> <4, (2, 6)> <5, (0, 7)> <6, (3, 4)> <7, (5, 6)> <8, (0, 1)>
