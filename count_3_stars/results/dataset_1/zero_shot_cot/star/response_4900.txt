Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

First, let's list the unique 3-stars by examining each node in the graph as the potential center of a 3-star. We will check each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star structure.

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 2, 7
- Node 5: Neighbors are 7, 9
- Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: Neighbor is 1
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, )>
<5, (7, 9, )>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: 9
