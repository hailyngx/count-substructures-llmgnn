Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, let's list down the 3-stars in the graph and count them.

1. From node 0: 
<0, (6, 9)>
<0, (6, 9)>

2. From node 1:
<1, (3, 9)>

3. From node 2:
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<2, (5, 3, 4)>

4. From node 3:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 1, 4)>
<3, (4, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 2, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 1)>
<3, (4, 9, 7)>
<3, (7, 2, 5)>
<3, (7, 5, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>

5. From node 4:
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 2, 8)>
<4, (8, 2, 3)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 6)>

6. From node 5:
<5, (2, 7, 3)>
<5, (7, 2, 3)>

7. From node 6:
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 0, 8)>

8. From node 7:
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (6, 3, 5)>

9. From node 8:
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 4, 9)>

10. From node 9:
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (6, 0, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 4)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 22.]
