Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their neighbors. 

Central nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

3-stars:
<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6)>
<4, (1, 5)>
<5, (4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 6)>
<8, (0, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)> 

Count of 3-stars: [10]
