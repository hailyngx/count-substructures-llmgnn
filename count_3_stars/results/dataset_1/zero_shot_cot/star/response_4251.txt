Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes, forming the structure of a 3-star. 

Given the graph with the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
