Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 8, ?)>
- <1, (0, ?, ?)>
- <2, (3, 7, ?)>
- <3, (2, ?, ?)>
- <4, (5, ?, ?)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, ?, ?)>
- <7, (2, ?, ?)>
- <8, (0, ?, ?)>
- <9, (5, ?, ?)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
