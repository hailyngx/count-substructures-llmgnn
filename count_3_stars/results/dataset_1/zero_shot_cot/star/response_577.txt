Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4 <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8 <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7 <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 6 also forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 9 <6, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
