Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. The central node and its attached nodes:
   - Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 8)
   <2, (5, 8)>

2. The central node and its attached nodes:
   - Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7)
   <4, (5, 7)>

3. The central node and its attached nodes:
   - Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7)
   <5, (2, 4, 6)>

4. The central node and its attached nodes:
   - Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 7)
   <6, (5, 7)>

5. The central node and its attached nodes:
   - Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)
   <7, (0, 4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
