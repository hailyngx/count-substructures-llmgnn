Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's follow these steps:

1. To form a 3-star, we need to find nodes with exactly three neighbors.

2. Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors based on the given edges.

Based on the provided edges, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 3, 8, and 9.

3. For each of these nodes, list the unique 3-stars:

- For node 3: <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- For node 8: <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- For node 9: <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
