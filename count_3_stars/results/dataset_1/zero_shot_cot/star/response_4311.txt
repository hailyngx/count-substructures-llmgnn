Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes and their edges one by one to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8.
  Therefore, <0, (2, 5, 7)> and <0, (2, 5, 8)> are two 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
  Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 1 as the center since it doesn't have exactly three neighbors.

- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
  Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 2 as the center since it doesn't have exactly three neighbors.

- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
  Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 3 as the center since it doesn't have exactly three neighbors.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
  Therefore, <4, (5, 6, 9)> is a 3-star with node 4 as the center.

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
  Therefore, there are no additional 3-stars with node 5 as the center since we already counted one.

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
  Therefore, there are no additional 3-stars with node 6 as the center since we already counted one.

- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
  Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 7 as the center since it doesn't have exactly three neighbors.

- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
  Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 8 as the center since it doesn't have exactly three neighbors.

- Node 9 is connected to node 4.
  Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center since it doesn't have exactly three neighbors.

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are: <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, and <4, (5, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
