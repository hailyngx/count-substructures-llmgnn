Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node in each 3-star.  
List of nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  

Step 2: Identify the leaves connected to each central node in the 3-star.  
- For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 6)  
- For node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8)  
- For node 2: (2, 4), (2, 9)  
- For node 3: (3, 9)  
- For node 4: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6)  
- For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 9)  
- For node 6: (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7)  
- For node 7: (7, 6)  
- For node 8: (8, 1), (8, 9)  
- For node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8)  

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.  
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

Therefore, the answer is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, and <9, (2, 3, 5, 8)>.
