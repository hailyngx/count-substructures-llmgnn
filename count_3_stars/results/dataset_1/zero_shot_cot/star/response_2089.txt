Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with 3 edges, as they can potentially form 3-stars.
    - Node 2 has 4 edges: (0, 2), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9)
    - Node 4 has 4 edges: (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9)
    - Node 9 has 6 edges: (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9)

Step 2: Check for 3-stars involving these nodes.
    - For node 2:
        - <2, (0, 5, 8)> is not a 3-star as 0, 5, and 8 are not directly connected to each other.
        - <2, (0, 5, 9)> forms a 3-star.
    - For node 4:
        - <4, (3, 6, 7)> is not a 3-star as 3, 6, and 7 are not directly connected to each other.
        - <4, (3, 6, 9)> is not a 3-star as 6 and 9 are not directly connected.
        - <4, (3, 7, 9)> forms a 3-star.
    - For node 9:
        - <9, (2, 8, 4)> is not a 3-star as 4 and 8 are not directly connected.
        - <9, (2, 3, 7)> is not a 3-star as 3 and 7 are not directly connected.
        - <9, (2, 3, 4)> forms a 3-star.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
    - Two unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>

Output: 
[2]
