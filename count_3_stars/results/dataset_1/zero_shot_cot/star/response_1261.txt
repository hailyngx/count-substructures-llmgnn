Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (3, 8, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
