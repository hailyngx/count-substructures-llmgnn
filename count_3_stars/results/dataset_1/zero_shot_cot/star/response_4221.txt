Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to form 3-stars.  
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1.  
So, the possible 3-stars with central node 0 are:  
<0, (1, 4, 9)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 to form 3-stars.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.  
So, the possible 3-stars with central node 1 are:  
<1, (0, 4, 9)>  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 2 to form 3-stars.  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.   
So, the possible 3-stars with central node 2 are:  
<2, (1, 3, 6)>

Since we are considering unique 3-stars, the final count of 3-stars in this graph is [4].  
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 4, 9)>  
<1, (0, 4, 9)>  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
