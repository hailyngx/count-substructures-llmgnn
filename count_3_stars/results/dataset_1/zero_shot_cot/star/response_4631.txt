Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they are the center of a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 8 
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 6

2. Check 3-star configurations:
   - (4, 2, 5): Node 4 is the center, and nodes 2 and 5 are the leaves. (<4, (2, 5)>)
   - (4, 3, 6): Node 4 is the center, and nodes 3 and 6 are the leaves. (<4, (3, 6)>)
   - (5, 2, 4): Node 5 is the center, and nodes 2 and 4 are the leaves. (<5, (2, 4)>)
   - (6, 3, 4): Node 6 is the center, and nodes 3 and 4 are the leaves. (<6, (3, 4)>)
   - (8, 4, 5): Node 8 is the center, and nodes 4 and 5 are the leaves. (<8, (4, 5)>)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <4, (2, 5)>, <4, (3, 6)>, <5, (2, 4)>, <6, (3, 4)>, and <8, (4, 5)>. [5]
