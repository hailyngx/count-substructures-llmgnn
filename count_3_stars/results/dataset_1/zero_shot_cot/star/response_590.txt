Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 0 because it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 1 because it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

3. Node 3:
   - Connected to node 1.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 3 because it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

4. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 0 and 9.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 4 because it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

5. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 5 because it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

6. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 6 because it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

7. Node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 6 and 9.
   - There is no 3-star centered at node 7 because it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

8. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
   - So, node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 9.

9. Node 9:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
   - So, node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
  
Unique 3-stars found: 
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
