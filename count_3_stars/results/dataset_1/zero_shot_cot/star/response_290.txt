Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the nodes that meet this criteria are: 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Next, let's list the 3-stars with their unique representations:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
