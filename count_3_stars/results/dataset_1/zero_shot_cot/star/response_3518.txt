Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (4, 2, NIL)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, NIL, NIL)>
<6, (4, 2, 7)>
<7, (6, 2, NIL)>
<8, (4, 6, NIL)>
<9, (5, 2, NIL)>

Considering there is no restriction on the orientation of the 3-star, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
