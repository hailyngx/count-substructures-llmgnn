Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Now, let's find the 3-star patterns in this graph:
- <0, (2, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6)>
- <7, (2, 6)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars, we get [3].
