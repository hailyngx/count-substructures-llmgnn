Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, -)>
<2, (3, 5, -)>
<3, (2, 8, -)>
<4, (6, 8, -)>
<5, (2, -, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

[9]
