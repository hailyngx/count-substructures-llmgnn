Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9. Since node 0 is connected to exactly 5 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5. This forms a 3-star centered at node 1 with leaves 0, 3, 5. Let's count this.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 9. Since node 2 is connected to exactly 2 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1. This forms a 3-star centered at node 3 with leaves 0, 1. Let's count this.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6. Since node 4 is connected to exactly 2 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

6. Node 5 is connected to node 1. Since node 5 is connected to exactly 1 node, it cannot form a 3-star.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 9. Since node 6 is connected to exactly 4 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 9. This forms a 3-star centered at node 7 with leaves 0, 6, 9. Let's count this.

9. Node 8 is connected to node 0. Since node 8 is connected to exactly 1 node, it cannot form a 3-star.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7. Since node 9 is connected to exactly 4 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
