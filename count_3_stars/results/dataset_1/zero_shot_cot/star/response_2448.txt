Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (2, 3, 7)
2. Node 1: (2, 7, 9)
3. Node 2: (0, 1, 5)
4. Node 4: (6, 7, 8)
5. Node 9: (1, 2, 5)

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>
