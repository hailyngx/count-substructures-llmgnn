Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given Graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (6, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[Number of 3-stars: 3]

<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
