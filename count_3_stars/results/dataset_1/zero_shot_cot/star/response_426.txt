Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. We will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

From the given graph, the nodes with 3 edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 0:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
Total 3-stars with Node 0 as the center: 4

For Node 3:
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
Total 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: 3

For Node 5:
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
Total 3-stars with Node 5 as the center: 4

For Node 7:
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
Total 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
