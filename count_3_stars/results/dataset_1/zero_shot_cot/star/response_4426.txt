Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three edges, which are potential central nodes of 3-stars. From the given edges, the nodes with three edges are: 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's analyze each potential central node:
1. For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9) -> <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 8) -> <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>
3. For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9) -> <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>
4. For node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 9) -> <7, (0, 1, 9)>
5. For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 7) -> <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get: [13]
