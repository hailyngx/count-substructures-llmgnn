Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (4, 6)

- Node 2: (3, 4, 8), (4, 2, 9)

- Node 4: (0, 2, 6), (2, 4, 5), (4, 0, 7), (5, 4, 7), (7, 4, 8)

- Node 5: (4, 7) 

- Node 6: (0, 4)

- Node 7: (4, 5)

- Node 8: (2, 4)

- Node 9: (2, 4)

Therefore, we have identified the unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (4, 0, 7)>, <4, (5, 4, 7)>, <4, (7, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
