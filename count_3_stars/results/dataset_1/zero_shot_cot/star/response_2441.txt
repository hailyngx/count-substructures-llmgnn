Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. 
A central node in a 3-star graph is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the given edges, the nodes and their number of connections are as follows:
- Node 0 has 2 connections
- Node 1 has 3 connections
- Node 2 has 3 connections
- Node 3 has 4 connections
- Node 4 has 2 connections
- Node 5 has 3 connections
- Node 6 has 2 connections
- Node 7 has 2 connections
- Node 8 has 4 connections
- Node 9 has 4 connections

Therefore, the central nodes in this graph are nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. For central node 1:
   - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 2, 8)>
2. For central node 2:
   - <2, (3, 8, 9)>
   - <2, (3, 8, 1)>
3. For central node 5:
   - <5, (6, 1, 9)>
4. For central node 8:
   - <8, (1, 2, 3)>
5. For central node 9:
   - <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
