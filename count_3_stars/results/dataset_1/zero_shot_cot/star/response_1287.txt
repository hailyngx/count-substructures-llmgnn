Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (9, 1, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 6)>
