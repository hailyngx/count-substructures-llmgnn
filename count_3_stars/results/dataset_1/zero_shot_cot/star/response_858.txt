Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
