Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes for each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go step-by-step: 

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 9.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

2. Count the number of 3-stars using the identified central nodes:
- For node 2: (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 7), (2, 6, 7), (2, 7, 9), (2, 4, 9) <2, (4, 5, 6, 7, 9)>.
- For node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 5, 7), (3, 0, 7) <3, (0, 5, 7)>.
- For node 4: (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 9), (4, 2, 9) <4, (1, 2, 9)>.
- For node 9: (9, 1, 2), (9, 1, 4), (9, 2, 4) <9, (1, 4, 2)>.
- For node 7: (7, 1, 2), (7, 1, 5), (7, 1, 8), (7, 2, 3), (7, 2, 5) <7, (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

<2, (4, 5, 6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)>.
