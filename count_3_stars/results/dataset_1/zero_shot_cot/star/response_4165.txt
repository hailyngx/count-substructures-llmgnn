Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes of the potential 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has its center connected to exactly three other nodes, let's find the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

The nodes that have 3 neighbors are: 3 and 9.

Next, let's find the neighbors of each central node:

For node 3, the neighbors are: 2, 4, 6, 9.

For node 9, the neighbors are: 3, 4, 8.

Now, let's count how many 3-stars exist in the graph:

- For node 3:
  - <3, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
  
- For node 9:
  - <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
