Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes with degree 3. In the given graph, nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7 are the central nodes.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

For node 0:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>

For node 5:
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
