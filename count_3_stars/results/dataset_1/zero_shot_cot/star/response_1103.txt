Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three edges connecting to it, and then identify the other nodes that are connected to this central node. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
