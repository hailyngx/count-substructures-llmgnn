Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of each 3-star pattern.

The central node of a 3-star will have degree 3, while the three leaf nodes connected to the central node will have degree 1.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph and then count the total number.

<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
