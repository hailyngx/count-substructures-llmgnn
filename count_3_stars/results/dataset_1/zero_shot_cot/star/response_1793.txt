Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes in the graph:

Central node (0): Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6
Central node (1): Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7
Central node (2): Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

[3]

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
