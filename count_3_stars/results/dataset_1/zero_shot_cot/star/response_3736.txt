Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find and list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with (1, 2, 4)
2. Node 6 forms a 3-star with (3, 4, 9)
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with (4, 6, 7)
