Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 9, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 9)>
3. <2, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (2, 2, 9)>
6. <5, (7, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
