Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)
   <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   <0, (1, 4, 6)>
   
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)
   <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   
3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7)
   <2, (1, 3, 7)>
   
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2)
   
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6)
   <4, (0, 5, 6)>
   
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4)
   
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9)
   <6, (0, 7, 9)>
   
8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 6)

9. Node 9: (9, 6)

Hence, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in this given graph.
