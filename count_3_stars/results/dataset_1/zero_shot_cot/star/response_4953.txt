Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes as required for a 3-star. These nodes would be potential central nodes of 3-stars:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- No other nodes have exactly three connections.

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars that we find:

<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
