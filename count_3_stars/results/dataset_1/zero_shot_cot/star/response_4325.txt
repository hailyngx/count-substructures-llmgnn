Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars.

Let's first list the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, -)>
<4, (3, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8].
