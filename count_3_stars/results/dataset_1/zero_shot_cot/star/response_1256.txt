Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (7)>
<5, (1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
