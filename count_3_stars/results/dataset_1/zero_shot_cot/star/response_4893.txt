Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to see if any 3-stars exist in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 5, 6)> - Node 0 as the center, connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
2. <1, (7, 8, 9)> - Node 1 as the center, connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
3. <2, (0, 4, 5)> - Node 2 as the center, connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
4. <4, (2, 5, 7)> - Node 4 as the center, connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
