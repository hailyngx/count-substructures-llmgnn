Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. It seems there are only two such instances in this graph.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
