Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Finding 3-stars involves identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star revolves around a central node, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Let's analyze the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[5]

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
