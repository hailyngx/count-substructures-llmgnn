Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we will look for nodes that are connected to 3 neighbors, which form a 3-star structure with that node as the center.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 5. This forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 4)>

So, there are four 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
