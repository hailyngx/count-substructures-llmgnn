Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can search for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (6, 7, X)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 7, X)>

Since each 3-star consists of a central node and three other connected nodes, we have a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [6].
