Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- From node 1: <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- From node 2: No 3-star
- From node 3: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- From node 4: No 3-star
- From node 5: <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- From node 6: No 3-star
- From node 7: No 3-star
- From node 8: No 3-star
- From node 9: <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>.
