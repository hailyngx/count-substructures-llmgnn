Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <1, (3, 8, 7)>
2. <3, (1, 8, 7)>
3. <7, (4, 6, 8)>
4. <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
