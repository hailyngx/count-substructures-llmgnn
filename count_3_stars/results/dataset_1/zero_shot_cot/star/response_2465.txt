Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
2. <5, (1, 6, 8)>
3. <7, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <8, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <9, (1, 3, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
