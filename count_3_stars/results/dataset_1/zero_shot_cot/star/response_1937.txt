Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 4

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:
1. Node 2 is the center node with neighbors 1, 4, 9: <2, (1, 4, 9)>
2. Node 4 is the center node with neighbors 0, 2, 5: <4, (0, 2, 5)>
3. Node 6 is the center node with neighbors 0, 1, 8: <6, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
