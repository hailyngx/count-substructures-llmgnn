Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list all the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars listed above. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
