Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
