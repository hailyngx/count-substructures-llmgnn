Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's find all 3-stars in this graph.

The central node of a 3-star can be any node in the graph. We will iterate through each node and check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (leaves) in the graph.

1. From node 0:
   - (0, 1), (0, 8) are connected.
   - Node 0 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes, so no 3-star here.

2. From node 1:
   - (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5) are connected.
   - Therefore, <1, (0, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.

3. From node 2:
   - (2, 6), (2, 7) are connected.
   - Node 2 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes, so no 3-star here.

4. From node 3:
   - (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8) are connected.
   - Therefore, <3, (1, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.

5. From node 5:
   - (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7) are connected.
   - Therefore, <5, (1, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.

6. From node 6:
   - (6, 2) is connected.
   - Node 6 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes, so no 3-star here.

7. From node 7:
   - (7, 2), (7, 5) are connected.
   - Node 7 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes, so no 3-star here.

8. From node 8:
   - (8, 0), (8, 3) are connected.
   - Node 8 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes, so no 3-star here.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
