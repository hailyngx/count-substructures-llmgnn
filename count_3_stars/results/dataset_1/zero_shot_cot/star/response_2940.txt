Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's list all the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0: 6, 8
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by checking each node as the center of a 3-star:

**Node 0:**  
- 3-star: 0 - (6, 8)  [0, (6, 8)]

**Node 1:**  
- 3-star: 1 - (7, 9)  [1, (7, 9)]

**Node 2:**  
- No 3-star as there are only 3 connections.

**Node 3:**  
- No 3-star as there are only 3 connections.

**Node 4:**  
- No 3-star as there is only 1 connection.

**Node 5:**  
- No 3-star as there are only 3 connections.

**Node 6:**  
- 3-star: 6 - (0, 2, 3)  [6, (0, 2, 3)]
- 3-star: 6 - (2, 5, 7)  [6, (2, 5, 7)]

**Node 7:**  
- 3-star: 7 - (1, 3, 5)  [7, (1, 3, 5)]

**Node 8:**  
- 3-star: 8 - (0, 4, 9)  [8, (0, 4, 9)]
- 3-star: 8 - (4, 9, 1)  [8, (4, 9, 1)]

**Node 9:**  
- No 3-star as there is only 2 connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (6, 8)>  
<1, (7, 9)>  
<6, (0, 2, 3)>  
<6, (2, 5, 7)>  
<7, (1, 3, 5)>  
<8, (0, 4, 9)>  
<8, (4, 9, 1)>
