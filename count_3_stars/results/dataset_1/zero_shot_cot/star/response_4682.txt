Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, -)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, -)>
<5, (8, - , -)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, - , -)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
