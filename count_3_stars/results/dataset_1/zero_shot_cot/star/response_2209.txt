Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 2 is the center in the following 3-stars:
    <2, (0, 1, 6)>
    <2, (0, 1, 9)>
    Total 3-stars for center 2: 2

2. Node 4 is the center in the following 3-stars:
    <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    Total 3-stars for center 4: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>.
