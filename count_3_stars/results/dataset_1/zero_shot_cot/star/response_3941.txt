Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central node of each 3-star in the graph. The central node is the node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 
Based on the given edges, we can identify the following central nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8

Next, let's create the list of unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars as requested, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in total.
