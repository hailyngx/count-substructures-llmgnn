Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Since each 3-star has a central node connected to three other nodes, we should look for nodes with exactly three edges. 

Let's identify the nodes with three edges:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 3, 4, 5
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 2, 4, 7
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 4, 7
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 6, 8
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 2
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 0, 8
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 3, 4, 7
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 6
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 3
- Node 9 has edges with node 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[6]

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
