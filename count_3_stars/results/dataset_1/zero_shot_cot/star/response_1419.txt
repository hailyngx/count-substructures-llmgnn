Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

The possible 3-stars can have central nodes numbered from 0 to 9. Let's go through each node and check the nodes it is connected to.

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. So, <0, (2, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8. So, <1, (2, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. So, <1, (2, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8. So, <2, (1, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. So, <2, (0, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. So, <2, (1, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. So, <3, (6, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. So, <4, (1, 2, 9)> is a 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8. So, <5, (1, 2, 6)> is a 3-star.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. So, <6, (1, 2, 5)> is a 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. So, <7, (0, 4, 2)> is a 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8. So, <8, (1, 2, 6)> is a 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. So, <9, (1, 2, 4)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (6, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
