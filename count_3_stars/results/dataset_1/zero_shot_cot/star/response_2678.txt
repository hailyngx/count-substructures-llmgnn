Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars present. 

Based on the given edges, we can list all the unique 3-stars as follows:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
