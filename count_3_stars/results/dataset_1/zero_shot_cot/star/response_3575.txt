Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first find the 3-stars in the given graph.

We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's enumerate the possible 3-stars based on the edges provided:

1. <0, (3, 8, -)>
2. <1, (5, -, -)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
5. <4, (9, -, -)>
6. <5, (1, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (5, -, -)>
8. <7, (2, 5, -)>
9. <8, (0, 3, -)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 5)> 

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars: 

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
   
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 8, -)>, <1, (5, -, -)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (9, -, -)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (5, -, -)>, <7, (2, 5, -)>, <8, (0, 3, -)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>
