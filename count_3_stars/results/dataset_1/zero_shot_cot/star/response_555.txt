Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
    - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (4, 5, 8)>

2. For node 2:
    - <2, (4, 3, 6)>
    
3. For node 3:
    - <3, (2, 4, 7)>
    
4. For node 4:
    - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
    
5. For node 5:
    - <5, (0, 4, 7)>
    - <5, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (4, 7, 9)>
    
6. For node 7:
    - <7, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <7, (0, 5, 9)>
    
7. For node 8:
    - <8, (0, 1, 5)>
    
8. For node 9:
    - <9, (4, 5, 7)>
