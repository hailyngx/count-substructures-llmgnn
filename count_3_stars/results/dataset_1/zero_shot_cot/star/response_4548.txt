Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 and their degrees.
- Node 0: 1, 6 (degree: 2)

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 and their degrees.
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8 (degree: 4)

Similarly, let's identify the nodes connected to other nodes:
- Node 2: 1, 4 (degree: 2)
- Node 3: 7 (degree: 1)
- Node 4: 2, 6, 8 (degree: 3)
- Node 5: 9 (degree: 1)
- Node 6: 0, 4 (degree: 2)
- Node 7: 1, 3, 9 (degree: 3)
- Node 8: 1, 4 (degree: 2)
- Node 9: 5, 7 (degree: 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node as a center of a potential 3-star.
- Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed using node 0 as the center.
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.
- Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed using node 2 as the center.
- Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed using node 3 as the center.
- Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 0, 8)> are 3-stars.
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed using node 5 as the center.
- Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed using node 6 as the center.
- Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 9)> is a 3-star.
- Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed using node 8 as the center.
- Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed using node 9 as the center.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 0, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
