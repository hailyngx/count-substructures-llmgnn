Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 1, 2)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 3)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 3)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 7)>
7. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 6, 9)>
9. <8, (3, 6, 9)>
10. <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
