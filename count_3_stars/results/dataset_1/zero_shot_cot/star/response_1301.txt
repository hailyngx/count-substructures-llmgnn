Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars.

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 has neighbors 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 4, and 5.

2. Count the 3-stars using the identified nodes:
- There is a 3-star centered at node 1 with leaves 2, 7, and 8.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 2 with leaves 1, 6, and 8.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 5 with leaves 3, 6, and 7.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 6 with leaves 2, 4, and 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, and <6, (2, 4, 5)>.
