Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 7, -)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8].
