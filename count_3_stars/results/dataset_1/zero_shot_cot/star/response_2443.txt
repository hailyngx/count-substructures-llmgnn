Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
We will first identify all 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 2, 4, and 9. So the 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
   <0, (2, 4, 9)>

2. Node 1 has an edge with node 3. Since it does not have two other edges to form a 3-star, there are no 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

3. Node 2 has an edge with node 0. Since it does not have two other edges to form a 3-star, there are no 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

4. Node 3 has edges with nodes 1 and 4. So the 3-stars with node 3 as the center are:
   <3, (1, 4, 5)>

5. Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 9. So the 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
   <4, (0, 3, 5)>
   <4, (0, 3, 6)>
   <4, (0, 5, 6)>
   <4, (3, 5, 6)>
   <4, (5, 6, 9)>

6. Nodes 5, 6, and 9 do not have enough edges to form 3-stars.

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total count of [5]. So, the answer is [5].
