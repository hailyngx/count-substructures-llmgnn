Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.
We can see that there are 3 nodes (0, 5, 9) with degree 2 (connected to 2 other nodes), and hence, each forms a 3-star structure with its two connected nodes.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.

So, the answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2)>
<9, (0, -)>
