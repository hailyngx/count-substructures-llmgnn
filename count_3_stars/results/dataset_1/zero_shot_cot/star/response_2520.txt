Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars. The nodes with exactly 3 adjacent nodes are the potential central nodes. 

Potential central nodes: 0, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's look at each potential central node and list the connected nodes to identify the 3-stars in the graph.

For central node 0:
Connected nodes: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
Possibilities for 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>

For central node 4:
Connected nodes: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8
Possibilities for 3-stars: 
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>

For central node 6:
Connected nodes: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
Possibilities for 3-stars:
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (6, 8, 9)>

For central node 7:
Connected nodes: 2, 6, 8, 9
Possibilities for 3-stars:
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, we have found a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph. We represent them in the unique format inside brackets [].
