Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 8
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 2 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)> and <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 8)> and <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars: <3, (1, 7, 9)> and <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 2 3-stars: <4, (2, 7, 8)> and <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 2 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 9)> and <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (0, 4, 2)> and <8, (0, 4, 2)>
- Node 9 forms 2 3-stars: <9, (3, 7, 1)> and <9, (3, 7, 1)>

Total number of 3-stars: 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12
So, the final answer is [12].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 2)>, <9, (3, 7, 1)>
