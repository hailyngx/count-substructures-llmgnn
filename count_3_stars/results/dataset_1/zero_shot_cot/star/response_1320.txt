Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 1: (1, 2, 9), (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 8)
2. From node 2: (2, 1, 9)
3. From node 3: (3, 1, 5), (3, 4, 9)
4. From node 4: (4, 0, 3)
5. From node 5: (5, 1, 8), (5, 6, 8)
6. From node 6: (6, 5, 9)
7. From node 8: (8, 1, 5), (8, 9, 5)
8. From node 9: (9, 2, 3), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
