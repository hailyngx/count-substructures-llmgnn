Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 1 is connected to Node 6
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 7, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to Node 3
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 6 and 9
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph. 

[The total number of 3-stars is 3]

[<2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>]
