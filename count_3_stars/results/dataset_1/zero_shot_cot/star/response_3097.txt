Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by observing the connections between nodes.

1. Check each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each node found, check if those three connections form a 3-star.

From the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 2: (2, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 7, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
