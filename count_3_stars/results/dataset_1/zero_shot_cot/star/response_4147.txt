Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we need to find all 3-stars in this graph.

**3-Stars:**
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, -)>
<5, (2, 4, -)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

To find the total number of 3-stars, we count the unique combinations above:
