Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (8, 2, 4)>
2. <1, (4, 9, 0)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (4, 7, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 7)>
6. <5, (2, 6, 9)>
7. <6, (7, 9, 2)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 6)>
9. <8, (0, 2, 4)>
10. <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
