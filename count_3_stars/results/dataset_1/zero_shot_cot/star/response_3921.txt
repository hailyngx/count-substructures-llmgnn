Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars:
1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. For each identified node, check if it is connected to those 3 nodes directly.
3. Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 7, 9. Not a 3-star.
- Node 1: Connected to node 3. Not a 3-star.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 7. Possible 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 7.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 9. Not a 3-star.
- Node 4: Connected to node 8. Not a 3-star.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 7. Possible 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 7.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 7. Possible 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 7.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6. Not a 3-star.
- Node 8: Connected to node 4. Not a 3-star.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 3. Not a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <2, (5, 6, 7)>.
There are a total of [1] 3-stars in the graph.
