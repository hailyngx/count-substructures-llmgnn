Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

In this graph, the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center and identifying the leaves connected to them. 

- For node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)> 
- For node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- For node 4: <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (7, 8)>
- For node 8: <8, (0, 3, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
