Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the definition of a 3-star graph, we can observe that each edge connected to a node can potentially form a 3-star with that node as the center. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
