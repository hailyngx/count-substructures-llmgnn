Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <3, (4, 8, -)>
4. <4, (3, 8, -)>
5. <6, (0, 1, -)>
6. <7, (1, 8, -)>
7. <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
