Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 5, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 2, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 1, 5)
- Node 3: (3, 1, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 2)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 8, 0)>, <1, (2, 8, 1)>, <2, (1, 5, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 5)>.
