Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify Central Nodes
In a 3-star graph, the central nodes will have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. Based on the given edges, the nodes that have 3 edges are 0, 6, 8, and 9.

<0, ...>
<6, ...>
<8, ...>
<9, ...>

Step 2: Find Adjacent Nodes
For each central node, identify the nodes it is connected to.

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Step 3: Count Unique 3-stars
Count the number of unique 3-stars based on the combinations found.

<0, (2, 4, 8)> 
<0, (4, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 0, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 3, 6)>
