Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 9, 6)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
