Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the possible 3-stars are:
1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 9)>
5. <5, (0, 1, 8)>
6. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
7. <9, (3, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
