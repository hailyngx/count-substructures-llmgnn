Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
