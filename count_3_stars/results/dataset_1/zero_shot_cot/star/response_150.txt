Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <4, (2, 8, 6)>
6. <5, (3, 7, -)>
7. <6, (2, 4, 8)>
8. <7, (0, 5, -)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
10. <9, (1, 2, -)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [10].
