Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (a 3-star pattern).

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 9, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 5)>

Counting the unique instances above, we have a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
