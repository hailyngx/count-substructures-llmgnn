Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes in the graph: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 3 is the center of the 3-star:
    - (3, 4, 8)
    - (3, 6, 9)
    - (3, 7, 8)
    - (3, 9, 6)
  
- Node 6 is the center of the 3-star:
    - (6, 2, 5)
    - (6, 3, 7)
    - (6, 5, 2)
    - (6, 9, 3)

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (4, 8, 6)>
<3, (6, 9, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 3)>
<6, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (5, 2, 6)>
<6, (9, 3, 6)>
