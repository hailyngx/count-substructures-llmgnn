Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

From the provided edges, we can see that the following nodes have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8

Next, we construct the 3-stars with each of these nodes as the central node:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

<>1, (3, 5, 8), 5, (0, 6, 8), 4, (1, 7, 8)<>
