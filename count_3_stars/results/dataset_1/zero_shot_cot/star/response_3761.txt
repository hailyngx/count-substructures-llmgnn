Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 7, 9
- Node 3: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 6

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 3, 9)>
- <1, (6, 5, 9)>
- <2, (7, 9, 3)>
- <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <7, (2, 9, 3)>
- <8, (3)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
