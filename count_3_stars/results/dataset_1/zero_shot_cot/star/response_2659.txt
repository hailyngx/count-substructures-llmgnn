Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (8)>
<6, (1)>
<7, (1, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
