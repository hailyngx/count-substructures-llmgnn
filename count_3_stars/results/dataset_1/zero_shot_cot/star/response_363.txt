Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We will identify each 3-star by looking for each central node and its three connected nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
