Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Based on the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (5, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 3, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 1, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>
<5, (7, 0, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we can see that there are [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
