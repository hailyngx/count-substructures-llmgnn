Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the central node for each potential 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we need to check each node to see if it is connected to exactly three nodes.

2. List the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Since there are 16 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
