Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs in this given graph. 
- A 3-star graph requires a central node with exactly three edges connecting it to three other nodes.

Let's determine the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star graph:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-star graphs identified:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [12].
