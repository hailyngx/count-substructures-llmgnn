Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 4, 8.

Next, let's identify the leaves connected to each of these central nodes to form 3-stars:
1. Central node: 0
    Leaves: 2, 3, 5, 6

2. Central node: 1
    Leaves: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8

3. Central node: 4
    Leaves: 1, 3, 5

4. Central node: 8
    Leaves: 1, 5

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- From node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- From node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- From node 4: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- From node 8: <8, (1, 5)>

Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
