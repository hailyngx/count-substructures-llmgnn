Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
