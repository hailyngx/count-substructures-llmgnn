Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 2: <1, (3, 8, 2)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <3, (1, 4, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8: <5, (2, 6, 8)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 9, and 8: <7, (0, 9, 8)>

Therefore, there are **5** 3-stars in the given graph.  
The final answer is **[5]**.
