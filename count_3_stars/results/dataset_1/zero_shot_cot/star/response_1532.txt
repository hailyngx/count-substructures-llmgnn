Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

- Node 2: connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 5: connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 6: connected to nodes 2, 9, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars formed with these nodes as centers.

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the output is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
