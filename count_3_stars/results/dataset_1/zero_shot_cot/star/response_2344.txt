Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences of 3-stars. 

Given the edges in the graph, let's list the three occurrences of 3-stars based on the definition provided:

1. Node 0 is the central node with leaves 4, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
2. Node 1 is the central node with leaves 2, 3, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
3. Node 5 is the central node with leaves 1, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
  
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
