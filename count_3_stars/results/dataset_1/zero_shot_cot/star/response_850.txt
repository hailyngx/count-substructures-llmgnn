Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.  
From the given edges, nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 each have three edges connected to them.  

Step 2: For each of the identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star.  
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8) forms a 3-star.  
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8) forms a 3-star.  
- Node 3: (3, 1) - Does not form a 3-star.  
- Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 9) - Does not form a 3-star.  
- Node 5: (5, 7), (5, 8) - Does not form a 3-star.  

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.  
The graph contains 2 unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 8)> and <2, (4, 6, 8)>.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
