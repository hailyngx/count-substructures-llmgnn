Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star in this graph can be any node with at least 3 neighbors. Let's list out the possible 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we get a total of [7].
