Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, 1, and 2 to form 3-star graphs. 

For node 0:
- Node 2 is connected to node 0. Thus, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 0 and leaves at nodes 2, 1, and 7. These nodes are connected as (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7).

For node 1:
- Node 2 is connected to node 1. Thus, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 1 and leaves at nodes 2, 0, and 8. These nodes are connected as (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9).

For node 2:
- Node 0 and node 1 are connected to node 2. Another 3-star is formed with the center at node 2 and leaves at nodes 0, 1, and 7. These nodes are connected as (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7).

Now, counting the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 1, 7)>
<1, (2, 0, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
