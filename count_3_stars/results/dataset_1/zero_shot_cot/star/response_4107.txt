Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The <0, (1, 7, 9)> 3-star is present, which means node 0 is the center connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.

The <1, (0, 3, 5)> 3-star is present, with node 1 as the center connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.

The <4, (2, 5, 8)> 3-star is present, with node 4 as the center connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
