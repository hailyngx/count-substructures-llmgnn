Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, the 3-stars can be formed with the central node being any of the following nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars with each central node:

1. For node 1:
    - <1, (2, 3, 2)>
   
2. For node 2:
    - <2, (1, 3, 1)>
    - <2, (3, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (6, 6, 6)>

3. For node 3:
    - <3, (1, 2, 1)>
    - <3, (2, 1, 2)>
  
4. For node 4:
    - <4, (5, 9, 5)>
    - <4, (9, 5, 9)>

5. For node 5:
    - <5, (4, 9, 4)>
    - <5, (9, 4, 9)>

6. For node 6:
    - <6, (2, 7, 2)>
    - <6, (7, 2, 7)>

7. For node 7:
    - <7, (6, 9, 6)>
    - <7, (9, 6, 9)>

8. For node 9:
    - <9, (4, 5, 4)>
    - <9, (5, 4, 5)>
    - <9, (7, 9, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
