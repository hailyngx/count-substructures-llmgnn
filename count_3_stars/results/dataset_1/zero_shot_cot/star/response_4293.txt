Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Based on the given edges, we have the following:

- Central Node 0: 2, 5, 7
- Central Node 1: 3, 7
- Central Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Central Node 3: 1
- Central Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Central Node 5: 0
- Central Node 6: 2, 4
- Central Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Central Node 8: 4
- Central Node 9: 4, 7

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are <0, (2, 5, 7)> and <4, (2, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
