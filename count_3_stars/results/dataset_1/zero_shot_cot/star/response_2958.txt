Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Analyze the 3-star structures in the graph.
   - The central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
   - Identify the nodes that act as the center in the 3-star structures.

Based on the given edges, the 3-star structures are as follows:
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
   - Count the number of unique 3-stars found above.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
