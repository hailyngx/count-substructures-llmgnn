Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify which nodes serve as centers of the 3-stars. In this graph, a center of a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors connected to it. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following nodes as potential centers of 3-stars due to having exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 2, 6, 8)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 1, 3)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 2, 5)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3)

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
