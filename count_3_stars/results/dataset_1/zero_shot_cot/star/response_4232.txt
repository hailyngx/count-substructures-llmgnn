Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (7, 9)>
2. <2, (5, 6)>
3. <3, (6, 9)>
4. <4, (6)>
5. <5, (2, 6)>
6. <7, (0, 6, 9)>
7. <8, (9)>
8. <9, (0, 3, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph, which is the number of unique configurations we found above:
