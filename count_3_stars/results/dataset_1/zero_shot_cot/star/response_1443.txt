Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2: (2, 5, 6)  
2. Node 5: (5, 2, 8)  
3. Node 6: (6, 2, 4)  
4. Node 8: (8, 5, 7)  
5. Node 9: (9, 1, 5)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
