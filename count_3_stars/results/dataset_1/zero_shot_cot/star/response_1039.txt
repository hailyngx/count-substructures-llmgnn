Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph by finding nodes with exactly three neighbors. Then, we will check each central node's neighbors to see if they form a 3-star. 

The central nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes: 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8. 

For each central node:
- Node 0 has neighbors {3, 7, 8}, forming a 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 2, 6}, forming a 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors {6, 7, 8}, forming a 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors {0, 1, 4}, forming a 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors {0, 4, 7}, forming a 3-star.

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
