Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 3, 7, 9 as the leaves.  
2. 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 4, 6, 8 as the leaves.  
3. 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 3, 5, 9 as the leaves.  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
