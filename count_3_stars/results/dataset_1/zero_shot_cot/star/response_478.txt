Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, _)>
<2, (0, 4, _)>
<3, (5, 8, _)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, _)>
<7, (0, 6, _)>
<8, (3, 9, _)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
