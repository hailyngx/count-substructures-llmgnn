Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the edges given, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4,  )>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
There are 4 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, )>
