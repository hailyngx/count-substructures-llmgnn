Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
In order to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Now that we have identified the 3-stars in the graph, we can count the total number of 3-stars present. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
