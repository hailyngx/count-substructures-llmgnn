Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-star structures.

First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 3, 6  
Node 1: 7, 9  
Node 2: 4, 6  
Node 3: 0, 6  
Node 4: 2, 8  
Node 6: 0, 2, 3  
Node 7: 1  
Node 8: 4  
Node 9: 1  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 2)>  
<1, (7, 9, 1)>  
<2, (4, 8, 0)>  
<3, (0, 6, 6)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
<0, (3, 6, 2)>, <1, (7, 9, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <3, (0, 6, 6)>
