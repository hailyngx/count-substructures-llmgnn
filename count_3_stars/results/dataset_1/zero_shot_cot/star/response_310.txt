Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

In this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 0, 2, and 8.

Now we can list the individual 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have [6].
