Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's visualize the given graph. 

The graph has the following edges:
- (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 9)
- (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 9)
- (2, 1), (2, 9)
- (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8)
- (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8)
- (6, 3), (6, 9)
- (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9)
- (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7)
- (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
[9]
