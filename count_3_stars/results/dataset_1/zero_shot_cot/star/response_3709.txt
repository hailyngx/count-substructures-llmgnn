Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's list all the 3-star patterns in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 5)>

Since there are 12 unique 3-stars listed above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
