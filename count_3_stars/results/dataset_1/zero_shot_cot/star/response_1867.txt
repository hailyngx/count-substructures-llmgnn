Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with three neighbors, which can potentially form 3-stars. 

Node 0, Node 3, Node 7, and Node 9 are the nodes with three neighbors. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
   
2. For Node 3:
   - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
   
3. For Node 7:
   - <7, (1, 9, 0)>
   
4. For Node 9:
   - <9, (2, 7, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
