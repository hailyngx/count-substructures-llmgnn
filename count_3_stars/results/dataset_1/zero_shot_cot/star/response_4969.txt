Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes with 3 incident edges. Based on the given edges, the central nodes are 1, 2, 5, and 9.

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node to determine the 3-stars.

For central node 1:
- Central node: 1
- Leaves: 2, 8, 9
<1, (2, 8, 9)>

For central node 2:
- Central node: 2
- Leaves: 1, 4, 6
<2, (1, 4, 6)>

For central node 5:
- Central node: 5
- Leaves: 0, 3, 4
<5, (0, 3, 4)>

For central node 9:
- Central node: 9
- Leaves: 1, 3, 6, 7
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
