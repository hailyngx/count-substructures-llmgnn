Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars based on the given information that a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the list of edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. **Node 0** forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. **Node 1** forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
3. **Node 7** forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <7, (1, 3, 9)>
4. **Node 8** forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <8, (0, 1, 9)>

There are **4** unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is **[4]**.
