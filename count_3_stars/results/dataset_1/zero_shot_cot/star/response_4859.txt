Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's look for all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 
- Node 1
- Node 5

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph.
Let's start with node 1 as the potential center of 3-stars:
- Node 1: (1, 2, 6), (1, 5, 9)

Now, let's move to node 5 as the potential center of 3-stars:
- Node 5: (5, 1, 8), (5, 3, 4)

After identifying the unique 3-stars, we count how many 3-stars are there in total.
There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 6, 1)>, <1, (5, 9, 1)>, <5, (1, 8, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>
