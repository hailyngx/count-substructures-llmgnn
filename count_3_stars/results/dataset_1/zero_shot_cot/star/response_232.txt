Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes in this graph. 
Central nodes:
- Node 0 has adjacent nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 8 has adjacent nodes 1, 2, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking at each central node:
1. Node 0:
   - (0, 2, 3, 4) form a 3-star.
   - (0, 2, 5, 6) form a 3-star.
   - (0, 2, 7, 8) form a 3-star.
   - (0, 3, 4, 7) form a 3-star.
   - (0, 3, 5, 6) form a 3-star.
   - (0, 4, 7, 8) form a 3-star. 

2. Node 8:
   - (8, 1, 2, 0) form a 3-star.
   - (8, 1, 2, 9) form a 3-star.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
