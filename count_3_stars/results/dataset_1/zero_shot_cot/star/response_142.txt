Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<Edge 0, (4, 9, 2)>
<Edge 1, (5, 8, 2)>
<Edge 2, (4, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (4, 0, 6)>
