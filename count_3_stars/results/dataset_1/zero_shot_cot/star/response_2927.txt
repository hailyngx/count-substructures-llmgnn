Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7: <4, (0, 1, 7)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 0: <5, (1, 6, 0)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <6, (1, 5, 7)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <7, (1, 4, 9)>
9. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7: <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
