Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighboring nodes.
    - Node 0 has 6 neighboring nodes (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)
    - Node 1 has 3 neighboring nodes (0, 3, 9)
    - Node 2 has 4 neighboring nodes (4, 5, 6, 8)
    - Node 3 has 1 neighboring node (1)
    - Node 4 has 3 neighboring nodes (0, 2, 9)
    - Node 5 has 4 neighboring nodes (0, 2, 8, 9)
    - Node 6 has 2 neighboring nodes (2, 9)
    - Node 7 has 2 neighboring nodes (0, 9)
    - Node 8 has 3 neighboring nodes (0, 2, 5)
    - Node 9 has 6 neighboring nodes (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7)
    
Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
    - Only nodes 1, 4, and 5 have exactly 3 neighboring nodes (3 stars).

[3]  
Unique 3-stars:  
<1, (0, 3, 9)>  
<4, (0, 2, 9)>  
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
