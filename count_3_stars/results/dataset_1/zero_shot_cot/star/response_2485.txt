Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the center nodes in the graph. The center node in a 3-star graph would be the node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it.

From the given edges:
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 9 has 6 edges connected to it.
- All other nodes have less than 3 edges connected to them.

Therefore, the possible center nodes are node 6 and node 9.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- If we choose node 6 as the center, the 3-stars would be:
    - <6, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 0, 2)>
    - <6, (1, 0, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 0)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 0)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 2)>
    - <6, (2, 0, 1)>
    - <6, (3, 0, 1)>
- If we choose node 9 as the center, the 3-stars would be:
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 3)>
    - <9, (1, 7, 3)>
    - <9, (1, 8, 3)>
    - <9, (1, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
The unique 3-stars found are:
    - <6, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 0, 2)>
    - <6, (1, 0, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 0)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 0)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 2)>
    - <6, (2, 0, 1)>
    - <6, (3, 0, 1)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 4, 3)>
