Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 5, 6, and 8 as the leaves. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 1, 4, and 6 as the leaves. <2, (1, 4, 6)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 4 as the leaves. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 0, 1, and 2 as the leaves. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [4].
