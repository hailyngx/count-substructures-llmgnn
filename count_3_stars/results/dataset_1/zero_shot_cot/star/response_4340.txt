Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7 are connected to exactly three other nodes. So, each of these nodes can act as a potential center of a 3-star. Let's list them:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 3)>

Now count the number of unique 3-stars: [4]
