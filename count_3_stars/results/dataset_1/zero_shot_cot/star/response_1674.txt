Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 2.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 9, and 5.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 6.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 9, and 7.

No other nodes have exactly three connections.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-star configurations:

1. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
3. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
5. <7, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
