Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9. So, the 3-star with node 0 as the center is <0, (1, 3, 9)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9. So, the 3-star with node 1 as the center is <1, (0, 7, 9)>.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9. So, the 3-star with node 3 as the center is <3, (0, 6, 9)>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. There is no 3-star with node 4 as the center since it has four connections.
5. Nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 do not have exactly three connections, so they cannot be a center of a 3-star.
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7. So, the 3-star with node 9 as the center is <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

There are [4] 3-stars in total.
