Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 0: The neighbors of node 0 are 3, 5, and 7. Thus, the 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
  - <0, (3, 5, 7)>

- For node 1: The neighbors of node 1 are 2 and 4. Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 1 as the center in this graph.

- For node 2: The neighbors of node 2 are 1, 3, 5, and 8. Thus, the 3-stars with node 2 as the center are:
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
  - <2, (3, 5, 8)>

- For node 3: The neighbors of node 3 are 0 and 2. Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 3 as the center in this graph.

- For node 4: The neighbors of node 4 are 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Thus, the 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
  - <4, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 8)>

- For node 5: The neighbors of node 5 are 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8. Thus, the 3-stars with node 5 as the center are:
  - <5, (0, 2, 4)>
  - <5, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <5, (4, 7, 8)>

- For node 6: The neighbors of node 6 are 4 and 8. Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 6 as the center in this graph.

- For node 7: The neighbors of node 7 are 0, 4, and 5. Thus, the 3-stars with node 7 as the center are:
  - <7, (0, 4, 5)>
  
- For node 8: The neighbors of node 8 are 2, 4, 5, and 6. Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 8 as the center in this graph.

- For node 9: The neighbors of node 9 are 6. Thus, there are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center in this graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>
