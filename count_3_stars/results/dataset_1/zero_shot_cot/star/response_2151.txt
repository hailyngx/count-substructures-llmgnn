Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Looking at the given edges, we can see that nodes 4, 8, and 9 meet this criteria. 

Next, find the nodes they are connected to, which will form the leaves of the 3-star graphs. 

For node 4: (1, 6, 8)
For node 8: (2, 4, 5)
For node 9: (0, 2, 3)

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars. 

There are two 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 6, 8)> and <4, (1, 8, 6)>.
There are two 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (2, 4, 5)> and <8, (2, 5, 4)>.
There is one 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
