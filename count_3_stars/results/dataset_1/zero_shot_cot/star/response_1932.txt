Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node in each potential 3-star. The central node must have exactly three edges connected to it.

From the given graph:
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it: (0, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 6).
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it: (1, 6), (4, 6), and (6, 8).
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it, which is more than 3, so it cannot be the central node of a 3-star.

Based on this information, we can see that there are <1, (0, 2, 6)> and <6, (1, 4, 8)> as the unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
