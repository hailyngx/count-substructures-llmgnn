Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star configuration.

First, let's identify the central node (the node connected to exactly three other nodes):

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7: <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and not part of a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9: <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and not part of a 3-star.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6: <5, (3, 6)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 5: <6, (3, 5)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 7: <8, (3, 7)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7: <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6)>
