Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

First, let's list the nodes that are connected to three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.

Now, let's list the 3-stars we found:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
