Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 9, 1)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (2, 4, 1)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <5, (3, 7, 6)>
6. <6, (3, 9, 7)>
7. <7, (5, 9, 6)>
8. <8, (4, 2, 0)>
9. <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
