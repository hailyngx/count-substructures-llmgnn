Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph will always have 3 outgoing edges in a 3-star pattern. So, we can count the number of 3-stars by examining each node as a central node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes. 

Let's check each node one by one:

1. Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. Node 1: Does not form a 3-star since it only has 2 outgoing edges.
3. Node 2: Does not form a 3-star since it has 3 outgoing edges but they are connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7, which do not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. Node 4: Does not form a 3-star since it only has 2 outgoing edges.
6. Node 5: Does not form a 3-star since it only has 2 outgoing edges.
7. Node 6: Does not form a 3-star since it has 3 outgoing edges but they are connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9, which do not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7: Does not form a 3-star since it has 3 outgoing edges but they are connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8, which do not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8: Does not form a 3-star since it only has 2 outgoing edges.
10. Node 9: Does not form a 3-star since it only has 2 outgoing edges.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
