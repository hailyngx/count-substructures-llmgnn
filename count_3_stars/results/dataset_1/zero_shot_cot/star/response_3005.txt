Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

There are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
