Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to node 8. 
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. 
    - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
  
2. Moving on to node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to node 6. 
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9. 
    - <2, (7, 8, 6)>

3. Next, we look at node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. 
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6. 
    - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
  
4. Finally, examining node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to node 6.
    - No 3-star can be formed from node 9.

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>.
