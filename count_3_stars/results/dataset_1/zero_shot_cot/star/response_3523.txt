Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6: <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8: <4, (1, 7, 8)>
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9: <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2: <6, (1, 2, 0)>
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8: <7, (1, 4, 5)>
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5: <8, (3, 4, 5)>
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5: <9, (3, 5, 0)>

Having found all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 10 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
