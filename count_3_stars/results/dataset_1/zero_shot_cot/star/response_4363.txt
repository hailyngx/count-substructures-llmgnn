Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9: <2, (3, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8: <3, (2, 4, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <4, (1, 3, 6)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <6, (0, 1, 4)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <7, (1, 5, 9)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6: <8, (2, 3, 6)>
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Hence, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
