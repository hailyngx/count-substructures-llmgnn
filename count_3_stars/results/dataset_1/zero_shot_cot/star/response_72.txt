Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star structure. 
To form a 3-star, a node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the possible 3-stars: 

1. Possible 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 6, 7)>
    <0, (2, 7, 8)>
    <1, (4, 5, 7)>
    <2, (0, 4, 8)>
    <4, (1, 2, 5)>
    <5, (1, 4, 7)>
    <6, (0, 3, 8)>
    <7, (0, 4, 5)>
    <8, (0, 2, 5)>
    <9, (3, 4, -)> (Node 9 only has 2 connections)

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
