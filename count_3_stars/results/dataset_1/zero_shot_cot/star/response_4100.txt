Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Find all nodes connected to the central node (degree 3 nodes).
    - Node 1: (0, 3, 4)
    - Node 3: (1, 5, 6)
    - Node 4: (1, 5, 9)
    - Node 5: (3, 4, 7)
    - Node 6: (3, 7, 9)
    - Node 7: (5, 6, 9)
    - Node 9: (0, 1, 4)

2. Count the total number of 3-stars. 

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
