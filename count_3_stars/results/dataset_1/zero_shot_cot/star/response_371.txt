Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Remember that in a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the potential central nodes are nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9 because they have exactly three edges connected to them.

Analyzing each potential central node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8.

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph: [6]

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)> 

Final answer: [6]
