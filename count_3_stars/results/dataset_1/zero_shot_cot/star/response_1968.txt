Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Then, we will count the 3-stars in the graph.

- Central Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Central Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Central Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Central Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8.
- Central Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Central Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Central Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Central Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- Central Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9.
- Central Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 1)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
