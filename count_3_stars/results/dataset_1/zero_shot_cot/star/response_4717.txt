Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:  

1. Node 0 is connected to {5, 6, 8, 9}.  
   - This forms two 3-star structures: <0, (5, 6, 8)> and <0, (5, 8, 9)>.

2. Node 1 is connected to {2, 7}.  
   - There are no 3-stars centered at node 1.

3. Node 2 is connected to {1}.  
   - There are no 3-stars centered at node 2.

4. Node 3 is connected to {8}.  
   - There are no 3-stars centered at node 3.

5. Node 4 is connected to {5}.  
   - There are no 3-stars centered at node 4.

6. Node 5 is connected to {0, 4}.  
   - There are no 3-stars centered at node 5.

7. Node 6 is connected to {0}.  
   - There are no 3-stars centered at node 6.

8. Node 7 is connected to {1, 9}.  
   - There are no 3-stars centered at node 7.

9. Node 8 is connected to {0, 3, 9}.  
   - This forms two 3-star structures: <8, (0, 3, 9)> and <8, (0, 9, 7)>.

10. Node 9 is connected to {0, 7, 8}.  
   - This forms one 3-star structure: <9, (0, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<0, (5, 8, 9)>  
<8, (0, 3, 9)>  
<8, (0, 9, 7)>  
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
