Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing out the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
