Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Let's start by listing out the unique 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (6, 7, -)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, -)>
<8, (0, 1, -)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, -)>

Now we can count the total number of unique 3-stars.
