Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 6, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
