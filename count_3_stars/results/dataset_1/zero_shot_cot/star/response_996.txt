Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible subgraphs where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will break this down step by step:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

2. For each node with 3 neighbors, identify the unique 3-stars:

- Node 6: <6, (3, 8, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 8, 9)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the final answer is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <6, (3, 8, 5)> and <7, (4, 8, 9)>.
