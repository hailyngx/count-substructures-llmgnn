Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Find all nodes with 3 edges connected.
From the given list of edges, we can determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: 1 edge
- Node 1: 3 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 4 edges
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 4 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 5 edges

Step 2: Identify 3-stars.
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.
Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have 8 unique 3-stars.
