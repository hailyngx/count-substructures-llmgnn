Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that have exactly three adjacent edges, which represent the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has adjacent edges to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 has adjacent edges to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 has adjacent edges to nodes 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph by considering the identified central nodes:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
