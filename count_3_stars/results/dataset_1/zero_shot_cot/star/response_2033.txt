Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to the center node.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7.
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
    - Count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node as the center of the star and checking the connected nodes.
    - No 3-star is formed around node 6 since it has no edges connected.

<1, (8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 9, 7)>
<5, (2, 8, X)> (No star as node 5 has only 2 connected nodes)
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, X)> (No star as node 8 has only 2 connected nodes)
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars [5].
