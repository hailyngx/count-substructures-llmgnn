Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 8, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
7. <8, (0, 1, 3)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
