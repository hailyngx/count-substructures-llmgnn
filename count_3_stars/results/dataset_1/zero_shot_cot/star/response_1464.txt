Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration, i.e., a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: (0, 2, 6, 7), (0, 6, 7, 8) - 2 3-stars
- Node 1: (1, 5, 6, 9) - 1 3-star
- Node 2: (2, 0, 4, 6) - 1 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 4, 6, 7) - 1 3-star
- Node 4: (4, 2, 3, 6), (4, 6, 7, 8) - 2 3-stars
- Node 5: (5, 1, 6, 9) - 1 3-star
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 2), (6, 3, 4, 7), (6, 7, 4, 0) - 3 3-stars
- Node 7: (7, 0, 4, 6), (7, 6, 0, 4), (7, 4, 6, 9) - 3 3-stars
- Node 8: (8, 0, 7, 4) - 1 3-star
- Node 9: (9, 1, 6, 7) - 1 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
  
Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 7, 4)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
