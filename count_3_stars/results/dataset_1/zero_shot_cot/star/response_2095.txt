Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 4, -)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
6. <5, (4, 9, -)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
8. <7, (2, -, -)>
9. <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
