Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7. Since it has exactly three edges connected to other nodes (1, 3, and 6), it can act as the center of a 3-star. 

Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5. Just like node 0, it can also act as the center of a 3-star.

Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7. Similarly, it can act as the center of a 3-star.

So the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we have [3].
