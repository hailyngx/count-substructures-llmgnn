Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 0, 6)>
<0, (6, 1, 7)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<0, (6, 7, 4)>

<1, (6, 0, 7)>
<1, (7, 4, 6)>
<1, (7, 6, 4)>

<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 0, 6)>

<3, (0, 6, 2)>

<4, (2, 0, 6)>
<4, (6, 0, 2)>
<4, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>

<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 1)>
<6, (1, 0, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 0)>
<6, (4, 0, 7)>
<6, (7, 0, 1)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>

<7, (1, 6, 4)>
<7, (4, 1, 6)>
<7, (6, 0, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [27]
