Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (6, 1, 4)>
<2, (6, 1, 5)>
<2, (6, 3, 5)>
<3, (5, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>
<6, (2, 1, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 3)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 6)>
<8, (5, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>
<9, (8, 5, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get the following:
[22]
