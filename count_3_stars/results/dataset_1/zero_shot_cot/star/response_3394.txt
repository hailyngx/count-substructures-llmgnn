Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list down the neighboring nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 1)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
