Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we find all nodes with degree equal to 3 since they can be potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 3: 0, 2, 5

Now let's list all possible 3-stars that can be formed with the given graph:

- For node 0:
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 2, 4)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 7)>

- For node 2:
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (5, 9, 3)>

- For node 5:
    - <5, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <5, (2, 9, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
