Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking for nodes that are adjacent to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 9, 3)>
<6, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
