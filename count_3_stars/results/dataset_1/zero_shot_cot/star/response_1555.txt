Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 6, 8)>
3. <3, (4, 7, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
5. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
6. <6, (4, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: 6
