Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

In this graph, we have identified the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in the given graph.
