Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 5) and (1, 5, 6)
2. Node 1: (0, 5, 6) and (0, 5, 7)
3. Node 2: (6, 8, 4)
4. Node 4: (5, 8, 9)

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (6, 8, 4)>
