Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars:

- Node 0: does not form a 3-star because it has only 3 edges and a 3-star requires 4 edges.
- Node 1: forms two 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 9)> and <1, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 2: forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 7)>.
- Node 3: does not form a 3-star because it has only 2 edges and a 3-star requires 4 edges.
- Node 4: forms one 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>.
- Node 5: does not form a 3-star because it has only 3 edges and a 3-star requires 4 edges.
- Node 6: does not form a 3-star because it has only 1 edge and a 3-star requires at least 3 edges.
- Node 7: forms one 3-star: <7, (1, 4, 9)>.
- Node 8: does not form a 3-star because it has only 4 edges but not in the required configuration for a 3-star.
- Node 9: does not form a 3-star because it has only 4 edges but not in the required configuration for a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, and <7, (1, 4, 9)>.
