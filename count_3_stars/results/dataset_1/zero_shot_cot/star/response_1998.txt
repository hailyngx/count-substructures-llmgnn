Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 0, 6)>
<4, (3, 0, 1)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 0, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 0, 6)>

Thus, there are 22 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [22].
