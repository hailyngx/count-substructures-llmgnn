Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars. We will then count the number of 3-star structures around each central node.

The nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-star structures around each central node:

- Central node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Central node 2: <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Central node 5: <5, (0, 4, 0)>
- Central node 6: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)
- Central node 9: No 3-star (only 2 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
