Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 
From the given edges, the central nodes are nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.

Now, for each central node, let's find the 3-stars connected to them:

For central node 1:
- 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- 3-star: <1, (2, 8, 9)>

For central node 3:
- 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 9)>

For central node 5:
- 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 8)>

For central node 9:
- 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 8)>
- 3-star: <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
