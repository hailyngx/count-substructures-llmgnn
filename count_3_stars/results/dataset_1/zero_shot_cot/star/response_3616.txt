Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central nodes and their respective leaves. 

Let's start by listing the central nodes and their adjacent nodes: 
- Node 0 has adjacent nodes 3 and 6
- Node 1 has adjacent nodes 3, 4, and 8
- Node 2 has adjacent nodes 5 and 9
- Node 3 has adjacent nodes 0 and 1
- Node 4 has adjacent node 1
- Node 5 has adjacent node 2
- Node 6 has adjacent nodes 0 and 9
- Node 8 has adjacent nodes 1 and 9
- Node 9 has adjacent nodes 2, 6, and 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (3, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1)>
<6, (0, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
