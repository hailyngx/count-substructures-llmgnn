Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form a 3-star. Remember, for a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (3, 6, 8)>
3. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
4. <2, (4, 6, 9)>
5. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
6. <3, (6, 4, 7)>
7. <3, (6, 5, 0)>
8. <3, (6, 0, 4)>
9. <3, (6, 5, 0)>
10. <3, (7, 4, 8)>
11. <3, (8, 0, 7)>
12. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
13. <4, (6, 3, 0)>
14. <4, (6, 5, 0)>
15. <4, (6, 0, 3)>
16. <5, (0, 6, 3)>
17. <6, (0, 3, 8)>
18. <6, (0, 4, 2)>
19. <6, (0, 5, 3)>
20. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
21. <6, (2, 4, 7)>
22. <6, (2, 7, 4)>
23. <6, (4, 2, 7)>
24. <6, (5, 0, 3)>
25. <6, (5, 3, 0)>
26. <6, (7, 4, 2)>
27. <6, (9, 2, 4)>
28. <7, (3, 6, 4)>
29. <7, (4, 6, 2)>
30. <7, (6, 3, 0)>
31. <7, (8, 3, 0)>
32. <8, (0, 3, 7)>
33. <8, (3, 0, 7)>
34. <8, (3, 7, 0)>
35. <8, (7, 3, 0)>
36. <9, (2, 6, 4)>
37. <9, (6, 4, 2)>
38. <9, (6, 8, 0)>

There are a total of [38] 3-stars in the given graph.
