Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 8, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 8, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 9, 9)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 8, 9, 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 3, 7, 8)

Next, we will list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 8)>
<3, (2, 9, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get: [5].
