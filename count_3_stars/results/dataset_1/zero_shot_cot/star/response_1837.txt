Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph, which are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we will form 3-star structures around each central node.

The central nodes can be determined by checking the nodes with degree equal to 3. In this case, node 1, node 2, node 3, and node 8 are central nodes.

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures around each central node:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [4].
