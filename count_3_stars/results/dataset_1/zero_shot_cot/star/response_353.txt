Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph.  
Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.

From the analysis above, the 3-star patterns in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
