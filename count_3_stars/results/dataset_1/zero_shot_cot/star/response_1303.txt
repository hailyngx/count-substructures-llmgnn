Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Following the definition provided, a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. First, let's list down all the nodes and their neighbors:

```
Node 0: 2, 6, 7, 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 5
Node 2: 0, 1, 8
Node 3: 1, 4, 6
Node 4: 3, 5
Node 5: 1, 4
Node 6: 0, 3
Node 7: 0, 9
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 0, 7
```

2. Now, for each node, let's identify if it forms any 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 2, 6), (0, 7, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 2, 5)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 1)
- Node 3: None
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: None
- Node 6: None
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: None
- Node 9: None

3. Finally, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

From step 2, we have found the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6), (7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 6), (7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5)>
