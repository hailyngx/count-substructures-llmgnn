Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is the central node of the 3-star:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>

2. Node 3 is the central node of the 3-star:
<3, (1, 5, 6)>

3. Node 4 is the central node of the 3-star:
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, 6)>

4. Node 5 is the central node of the 3-star:
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (8, 3, 2)>

5. Node 8 is the central node of the 3-star:
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>

6. Node 9 is the central node of the 3-star:
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (7, 4, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10]
