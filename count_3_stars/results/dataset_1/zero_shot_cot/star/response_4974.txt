Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all the nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 9, -)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 3, -)>
- <5, (6, 8, -)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
