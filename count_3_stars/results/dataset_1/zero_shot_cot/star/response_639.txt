Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze each node:

- Node 0: connected to 3 nodes (5, 8, 9)
  - <0, (5, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 1: connected to 1 node
  - Node 1 is not the center of any 3-star.
  
- Node 2: connected to 2 nodes
  - Node 2 is not the center of any 3-star.
  
- Node 3: connected to 2 nodes
  - Node 3 is not the center of any 3-star.
  
- Node 4: connected to 3 nodes (2, 6, 7)
  - <4, (2, 6, 7)>
  
- Node 5: connected to 2 nodes
  - Node 5 is not the center of any 3-star.
  
- Node 6: connected to 4 nodes (2, 4, 5, 9)
  - <6, (2, 4, 5)>
  
- Node 7: connected to 4 nodes (1, 3, 4, 9)
  - <7, (1, 3, 4)>
  
- Node 8: connected to 1 node
  - Node 8 is not the center of any 3-star.
  
- Node 9: connected to 4 nodes (0, 3, 6, 7)
  - <9, (0, 3, 6)>
  
Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
