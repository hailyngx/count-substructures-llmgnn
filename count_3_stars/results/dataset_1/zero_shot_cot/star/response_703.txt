Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star shape. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. **Identify Nodes Connected to Three Other Nodes:**
   - Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 3, and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 3, and 6.
   - Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes.
   - Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 1, 6, and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to 1 node.
   - Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes.
   - Node 6 is connected to 5 nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to 2 nodes.
   - Node 8 is connected to 1 node.
   - Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 2, 3, and 6.

2. **Counting 3-Stars:**
   - From the identified nodes, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming 3-stars.

3. **Listing the Unique 3-Stars:**
   - <0, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 3)>

4. **Calculating the Total Number of 3-Stars:**
   - Since there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
