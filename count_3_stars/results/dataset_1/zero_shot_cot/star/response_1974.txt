Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph: 

1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
6. <4, (0, 5, 9)>
7. <5, (2, 4, 7)>
8. <7, (1, 5, -)>
9. <8, (3, 4, -)>
10. <9, (3, 4, -)>

So, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
