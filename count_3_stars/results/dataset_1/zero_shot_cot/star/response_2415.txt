Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has exactly three edges connected to the center node, we need to look for nodes with degree 3. 
From the list of edges, nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9 have degree 3. These nodes can be potential center nodes of 3-stars.

Let's analyze each potential central node one by one:

1. Node 1:
   - (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
   - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 9)>

2. Node 4:
   - (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9)
   - <4, (3, 6, 9)>

3. Node 6:
   - (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9)
   - <6, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <6, (0, 1, 9)>
   - <6, (1, 4, 9)>

4. Node 7:
   - (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9)
   - <7, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <7, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
   - <7, (2, 5, 9)>
   - <7, (1, 5, 9)>

5. Node 9:
   - (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)
   - <9, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <9, (3, 4, 6)>
   - <9, (3, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Combining all unique 3-stars identified:
<[1, (5, 6, 7)> <1, (5, 6, 9)> <1, (5, 7, 9)> <1, (6, 7, 9)> <4, (3, 6, 9)> <6, (0, 1, 4)> <6, (0, 1, 9)> <6, (1, 4, 9)> <7, (1, 2, 5)> <7, (1, 2, 9)> <7, (1, 5, 9)> <7, (2, 5, 9)> <9, (0, 1, 3)> <9, (0, 1, 4)> <9, (0, 1, 6)> <9, (0, 1, 7)> <9, (1, 3, 4)> <9, (1, 3, 6)> <9, (1, 3, 7)> <9, (3, 4, 6)> <9, (3, 4, 7)> <9, (4, 6, 7)>>
  
There are 22 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the answer is [22].
