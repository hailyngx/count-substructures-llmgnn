Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, we need to check each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. Then, we will list all the unique 3-stars found. 

Let's start: 

- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8) --> 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8) --> 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4) --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9) --> 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 1, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7) --> 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: (5, 8) --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9) --> 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 7: (7, 4) --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9) --> 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8) --> 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 1, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
