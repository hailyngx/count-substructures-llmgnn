Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with three neighbors.
    - Node 0 has three neighbors: 4, 5, 9
    - Node 2 has three neighbors: 1, 7, 9
    - Node 3 has three neighbors: 5, 7, 9
    - Node 5 has three neighbors: 0, 4, 9
    - Node 7 has three neighbors: 1, 2, 3
    - Node 9 has three neighbors: 0, 2, 3

Step 2: Find the 3-stars in the graph.
    - <0, (4, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.
    - <2, (1, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.
    - <3, (5, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.
    - <5, (0, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.
    - <7, (1, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.
    - <9, (0, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
    - There are 6 unique 3-stars.
