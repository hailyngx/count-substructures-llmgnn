Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 8)>

Count: [2]
