Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3 and it must be connected to exactly 3 nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph: 

1. Node 1 is a central node:
    - Leaves: (0, 2, 5)
2. Node 2 is a central node:
    - Leaves: (1, 5, 6)
3. Node 5 is a central node:
    - Leaves: (1, 2, 6)
4. Node 6 is a central node:
    - Leaves: (1, 2, 5)
5. Node 7 is a central node:
    - Leaves: (3, 5, 6)
  
Therefore, we have identified the unique 3-stars as follows:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
