Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
