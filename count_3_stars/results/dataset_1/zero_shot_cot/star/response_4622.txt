Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars:

1. Nodes with three connections:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7, making it a potential central node for 3-stars.

2. For each potential central node identified in step 1, we will check if the connected nodes form 3-stars.

Checking for 3-stars with central node 2:

- Node 2 is the central node, and it is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7. Let's check each combination of three connected nodes:

1. (0, 1, 6) - This forms a 3-star with central node 2. Let's denote it as <2, (0, 1, 6)>
2. (0, 1, 7) - This does not form a 3-star.
3. (0, 6, 7) - This does not form a 3-star.
4. (1, 6, 7) - This does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, we found 1 unique 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 6)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
