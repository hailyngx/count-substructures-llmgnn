Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connections. 

Let's first list the edges incident to each node:
- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 9), (4, 0), (9, 0)
- Node 1: (1, 2), (2, 1)
- Node 2: (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 9), (9, 2)
- Node 3: (3, 8), (8, 3)
- Node 4: (0, 4), (4, 0)
- Node 5: (5, 8), (8, 5)
- Node 6: (6, 8), (8, 6)
- Node 8: (3, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 8)
- Node 9: (0, 9), (2, 9), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 8)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
