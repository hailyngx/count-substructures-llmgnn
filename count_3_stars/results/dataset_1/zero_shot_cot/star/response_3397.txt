Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.  
- Node 0 connected to: 4, 8  
- Node 1 connected to: 2, 7  
- Node 2 connected to: 1, 6  
- Node 4 connected to: 0, 5  
- Node 5 connected to: 4, 6  
- Node 6 connected to: 2, 5, 9  
- Node 7 connected to: 1, 8  
- Node 8 connected to: 0, 7  
- Node 9 connected to: 6  

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.  
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8 <0, (4, 8)>  
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7 <1, (2, 7)>  
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6 <2, (1, 6)>  
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5 <4, (0, 5)>  
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6 <5, (4, 6)>  
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 9 <6, (2, 5, 9)>  
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8 <7, (1, 8)>  
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7 <8, (0, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
- Total number of 3-stars: 8  

So, the final answer is [8].
