Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 3. Count: 3-stars with center 0 <0, (1, 2, 3)>.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 4. Count: 3-stars with center 1 <1, (0, 2, 4)>.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 8. Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 3. Count: 3-stars with center 2 <2, (0, 1, 3)>.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. Node 3 does not form any 3-stars because it is missing one connection to form a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9. Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, and 8. Count: 3-stars with center 4 <4, (1, 3, 8)>.

6. Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not form any 3-stars as they do not have exactly three connections.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, and <2, (0, 1, 3)>.
