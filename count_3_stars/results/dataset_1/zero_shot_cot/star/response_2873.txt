Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Starting with the central nodes:
1. For node 0:
    - Leaves: 1, 2, 7
2. For node 1:
    - Leaves: 0, 2, 9
3. For node 2:
    - Leaves: 0, 1, 5, 6
4. For node 3:
    - Leaves: 9
5. For node 4:
    - Leaves: 8
6. For node 5:
    - Leaves: 2, 8
7. For node 6:
    - Leaves: 2, 7, 8
8. For node 7:
    - Leaves: 0, 6
9. For node 8:
    - Leaves: 4, 5, 6
10. For node 9:
    - Leaves: 1, 3

Counting the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
