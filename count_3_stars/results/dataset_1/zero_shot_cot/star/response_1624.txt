Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. The center of the 3-star will be the central node, and the nodes it is connected to will be the leaves.

Upon examining the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 9, )>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (4, 6, )>
- <9, (0, 6, )>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
