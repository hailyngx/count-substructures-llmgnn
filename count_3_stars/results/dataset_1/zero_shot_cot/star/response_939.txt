Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars first. 

Let's analyze each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 9, 0)>
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>

So overall, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
