Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to other nodes by 3 edges, forming a 3-star pattern with one central node and three leaves.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Starting from node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Starting from node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)> and <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Starting from node 2: <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. Starting from node 3: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
5. Starting from node 4: <4, (0, 8, 9)>
6. Starting from node 5: <5, (0, 1, 3)>
7. Starting from node 7: <7, (0, 1, 5)>
8. Starting from node 8: <8, (1, 4, 7)>
9. Starting from node 9: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, and <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
