Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
