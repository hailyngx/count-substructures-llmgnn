Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three edges are: 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Next, let's find the actual 3-stars in the graph:

1. When considering node 0 as the center:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
   
2. When considering node 5 as the center:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. <5, (0, 1, 2)>

3. When considering node 6 as the center:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9. <6, (0, 4, 9)>

4. When considering node 7 as the center:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4. <7, (0, 1, 4)>

5. When considering node 9 as the center:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8. <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
