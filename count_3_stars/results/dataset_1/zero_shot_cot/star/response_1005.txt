Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars by finding central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
   
2. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <3, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <6, (0, 3, 9)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [3]
