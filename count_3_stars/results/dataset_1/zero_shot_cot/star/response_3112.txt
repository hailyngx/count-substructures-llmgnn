Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's go step by step:

1. Central nodes have degree 3 and leaf nodes have degree 1.
2. Look for nodes with degree 3: Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 9.
3. For each node with degree 3, identify the neighboring nodes. Count the 3-stars based on these configurations.

Based on the given graph, here are the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- For Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- For Node 4: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- For Node 5: <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- For Node 9: <9, (0, 8, 5)>
