Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 9, 4)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars:
