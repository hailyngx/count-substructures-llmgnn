Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

Nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7)

Next, let's form 3-stars by considering these central nodes and their connected nodes. 

So, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
