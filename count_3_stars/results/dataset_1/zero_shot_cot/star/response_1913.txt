Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them, we first need to identify the central node and its 3 connected nodes for each 3-star.

From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (7, 8, 2)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <8, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (4, 7, _)> (Note: Only 2 connected nodes are given.)

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get the total count as [5]. 

Therefore, the result is [5].
