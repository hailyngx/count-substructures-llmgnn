Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like structure.

Upon examining the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 5)>
<7, (1)>
<8, (3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
