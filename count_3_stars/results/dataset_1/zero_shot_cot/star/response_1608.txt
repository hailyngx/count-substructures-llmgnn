Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each potential 3-star. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly 3 edges. Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 4 has 2 edges.
- Nodes 0, 7, and 8 have 1 edge each.

2. Nodes 1 and 2 both have 3 edges, so they can potentially be central nodes of 3-stars. Let's check the neighbors of nodes 1 and 2:

For node 1:
- Neighbors of node 1: 3, 6, 7
- Potential 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
  
For node 2:
- Neighbors of node 2: 3, 5, 8
- Potential 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
  
Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
