Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are directly connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
