Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 0 and 9 as the leaves. So, <4, (0, 9)>. 
2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 9, forming a 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 6 and 9 as the leaves. So, <7, (6, 9)>.

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2.]
