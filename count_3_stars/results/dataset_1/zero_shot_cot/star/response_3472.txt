Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify nodes with 3 connections.
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 2.
- Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 2, 3, 7.

Step 2: Count 3-stars.
- Once we identify nodes with 3 connections, we need to check if a 3-star configuration is formed around each of these nodes.
- A 3-star is formed around node 0 with the nodes (1, 3, 4).
- A 3-star is also formed around node 3 with the nodes (0, 2 ,8).
- A 3-star is formed around node 8 with the nodes (0, 2, 3).

Step 3: Final count.
- Count of 3-stars: 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>.
