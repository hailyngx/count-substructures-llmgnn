Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list out the connections for each node to understand the structure of the graph:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
