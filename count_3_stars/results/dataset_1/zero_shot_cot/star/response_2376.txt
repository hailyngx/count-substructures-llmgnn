Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 1, 4, 7
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 0, 3, 7
3. Central node: 2, Leaves: 3, 6, 9
4. Central node: 3, Leaves: 1, 2, 4
5. Central node: 4, Leaves: 0, 3, 5
6. Central node: 5, Leaves: 3, 4, 8
7. Central node: 6, Leaves: 2, 8, 0
8. Central node: 7, Leaves: 0, 1, 9
9. Central node: 8, Leaves: 0, 5, 6
10. Central node: 9, Leaves: 2, 5, 7

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

<0, (1, 4, 7)> <1, (0, 3, 7)> <2, (3, 6, 9)> <3, (1, 2, 4)> <4, (0, 3, 5)> <5, (3, 4, 8)> <6, (2, 8, 0)> <7, (0, 1, 9)> <8, (0, 5, 6)> <9, (2, 5, 7)>
