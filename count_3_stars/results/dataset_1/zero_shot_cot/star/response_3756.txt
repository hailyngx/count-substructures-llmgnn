Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9. <1, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the graph.
