Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star is formed by the center node and three leaves that are connected to the center node.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
