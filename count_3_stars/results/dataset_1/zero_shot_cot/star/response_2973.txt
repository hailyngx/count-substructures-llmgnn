Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's list out the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>

(Note: We only list each unique 3-star once in angled brackets <>)

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
