Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 4, 6, 7
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 6, 8
3. Central node: 2, Leaves: 6, 9
4. Central node: 3, Leaves: 4, 5, 7
5. Central node: 4, Leaves: 0, 3, 8, 9
6. Central node: 5, Leaves: 3, 9
7. Central node: 6, Leaves: 0, 1, 2
8. Central node: 7, Leaves: 0, 3, 8
9. Central node: 8, Leaves: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
10. Central node: 9, Leaves: 2, 4, 5, 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
