Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, -)>
<8, (3, 4, -)>

Since the provided graph doesn't have any other 3-stars, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
