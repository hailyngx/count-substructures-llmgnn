Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 4)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 6)>
4. <4, (8)>
5. <5, (3, 6)>
6. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
7. <7, (6, 9)>
8. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
9. <9, (7)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
