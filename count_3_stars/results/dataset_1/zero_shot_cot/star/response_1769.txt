Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

1. Node 1 is a candidate for the center of a 3-star because it is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
   <1, (0, 2, 4)>

2. Node 2 is a candidate for the center of a 3-star because it is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
   <2, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
