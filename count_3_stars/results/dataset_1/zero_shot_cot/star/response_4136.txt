Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.  
Nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, identify the nodes connected to it.  
- For node 0: Nodes 6, 8, and 9
- For node 3: Nodes 1, 2, and 4
- For node 8: Nodes 0, 1, and 2

Step 3: Form 3-stars using the identified nodes.  
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>

Step 4: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
- Total number of 3-stars = 3

Output:  
[3]  
<0, (6, 8, 9)>  
<3, (1, 2, 4)>  
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
