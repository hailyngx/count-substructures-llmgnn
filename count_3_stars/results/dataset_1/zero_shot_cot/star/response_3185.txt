Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2: (2, 4, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 2, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 3, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 2, 4)
- Node 8: (8, 5, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 2, 8)

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6]

Therefore, the final answer is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 7, 2)>
<4, (2, 7, 4)>
<5, (3, 8, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>
