Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [3].
