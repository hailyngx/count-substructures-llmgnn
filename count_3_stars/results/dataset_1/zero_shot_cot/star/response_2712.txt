Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the given graph step-by-step.

First, let's list the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes based on the provided edges:
- Node 0 is connected to 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 1, 3, 5, and 8.

Now, we can list the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
