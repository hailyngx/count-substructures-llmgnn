Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph by finding nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. 

Nodes with 3 incident edges: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9

Now let's find the leaf nodes connected to each central node:

- For central node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- For central node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5.
- For central node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.
- For central node 5: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- For central node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- For central node 2: <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- For central node 3: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- For central node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- For central node 5: <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
- For central node 9: <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].

<2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>
