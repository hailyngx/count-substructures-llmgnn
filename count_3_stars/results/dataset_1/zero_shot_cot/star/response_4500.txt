Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (1, 3, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <1, (3, 4, 1)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
6. <4, (1, 2, 8)>
7. <4, (9, 4, 5)>
8. <5, (3, 7, 9)>
9. <7, (5, 8, 7)>
10. <8, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
