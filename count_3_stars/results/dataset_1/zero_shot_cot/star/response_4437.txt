Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph.
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Central node 0 with leaves 3, 6, 7
2. Central node 1 with leaves 3, 4, 6
3. Central node 6 with leaves 0, 1, 9
4. Central node 7 with leaves 0, 5, 8
5. Central node 9 with leaves 1, 6, 7

Thus, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
