Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). 

The nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

For node 1:
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>

For node 2:
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (7, 9, 1)>

For node 3:
- <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- <3, (8, 9, 1)>

For node 4:
- No 3-star as it has only two neighbors.

For node 6:
- <6, (7, 9, 1)>

For node 8:
- <8, (4, 5, 3)>

For node 9:
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (6, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

These 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 5, 7)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<2, (7, 9, 1)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<3, (8, 9, 1)>, 
<6, (7, 9, 1)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 3)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<9, (6, 7, 1)>.
