Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is directly connected to exactly three other nodes. 

At first, let's identify all nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to node 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6

From the given graph, we can see the following 3-star structures:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>

Clearly, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
