Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars. 

The 3-stars can be formed by selecting a node as the central node, and then finding nodes that are connected to the central node. Since a 3-star has exactly 3 leaves, we need to find all combinations of central node and 3 leaf nodes connected to it.

Let's go step by step:

1. Find all nodes that have exactly 3 edges:
    - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
    - Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 8
    - Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, 9
    - Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 9
    - Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, 9
    - Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
    - Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
    
2. For each node with exactly 3 edges, form the possible 3-stars:
- For Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- For Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- For Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- For Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- For Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- For Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- For Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
