Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star should have exactly three edges connected to it. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The center node 1 has three edges connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9, forming the 3-star <1, (3, 6, 9)>.

2. The center node 6 has three edges connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8, forming the 3-star <6, (1, 3, 8)>.

3. The center node 8 has three edges connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9, forming the 3-star <8, (2, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].

<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
