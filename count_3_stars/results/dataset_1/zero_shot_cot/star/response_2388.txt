Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

We have the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 0)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Hence, there are [6] 3-stars in the graph.
