Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph and count them. 

Let's first list down all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 4)>
<2, (3)>
<3, (2, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 5)>
<7, (3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5, 7)>
<9, (5)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
