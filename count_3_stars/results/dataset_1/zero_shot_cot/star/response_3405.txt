Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's list down the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars.
