Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 5, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 8)>
<5, (2, 2, 2)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 1, 1)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 9 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
