Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, and <9, (1, 2, 5)> 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
