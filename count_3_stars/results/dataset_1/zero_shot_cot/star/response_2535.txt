Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central node and its three connected nodes. Here are the steps to find all the 3-stars:

1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Once such nodes are found, check if they form a 3-star configuration.
3. Count the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6 are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Checking if they form 3-stars:
    - Node 1: (1, 3, 4, 5), (1, 4, 5, 7), (1, 4, 5, 9)
    - Node 4: (4, 1, 5, 6)
    - Node 5: (5, 1, 2, 4)
    - Node 6: (6, 3, 4, 7)
    So, the 3-stars are: 
    <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>.
