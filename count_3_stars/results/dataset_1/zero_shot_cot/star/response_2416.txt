Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs in this given graph.

The nodes connected to node 0 are: 5, 7
The nodes connected to node 1 are: 3, 6
The nodes connected to node 2 are: 3, 9
The nodes connected to node 3 are: 1, 2, 4
The nodes connected to node 4 are: 3, 5
The nodes connected to node 5 are: 0, 4, 8
The nodes connected to node 6 are: 1, 8
The nodes connected to node 7 are: 0, 8
The nodes connected to node 8 are: 5, 6, 7
The nodes connected to node 9 are: 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

From the above analysis, we can see that the possible 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6)>
- <2, (3, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
