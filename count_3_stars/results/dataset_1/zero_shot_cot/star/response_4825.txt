Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars: 
[4]

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
