Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
We will first identify all the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 9 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
