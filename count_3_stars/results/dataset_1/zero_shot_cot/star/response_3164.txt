Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0 has neighbors 3, 5, 6, and 7. Since it has exactly three neighbors (3, 5, and 6), it forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 6)>.
2. Node 1 has neighbors 2, 5, and 9. Since it has exactly three neighbors (2, 5, and 9), it forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 9)>.
3. Node 2 has neighbors 1, 4, 7, and 9. Since it has exactly three neighbors (1, 4, and 9), it forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
