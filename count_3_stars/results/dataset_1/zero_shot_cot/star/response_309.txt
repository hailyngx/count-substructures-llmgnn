Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Start by listing the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

2. Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with (2, 3, 5), (3, 5, 8), (5, 6, 8), and (6, 7, 8). 
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with (3, 4, 9), (4, 6, 8), and (6, 7, 9).
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with (1, 4, 9) and (4, 5, 7).
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with (0, 4, 9).

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.]
