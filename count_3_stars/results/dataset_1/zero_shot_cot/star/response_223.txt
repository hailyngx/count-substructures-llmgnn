Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, the 3-stars can be formed around nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, since each of these nodes is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

2. Counting the number of 3-stars for each central node:
   - Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 9) [2]
   - Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 8) [2]
   - Node 2: (2, 1, 5) [1]
   - Node 3: (3, 5, 9) [1]
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 7), (4, 0, 8) [2]
   - Node 5: (5, 2, 7), (5, 2, 3), (5, 3, 7), (5, 3, 9) [4]
   - Node 6: (6, 8, 9), (6, 9, 0) [2]
   - Node 7: (7, 4, 5) [1]
   - Node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 5), (8, 4, 6) [3]
   - Node 9: (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 3), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 8) [4]

3. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: 
   - <0, (1, 4, 9)> 
   - <1, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <2, (1, 5)>
   - <3, (5, 9)>
   - <4, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 9)>
   - <6, (8, 9)>
   - <7, (4, 5)>
   - <8, (1, 5), (4, 6)>
   - <9, (0, 5), (3, 6), (6, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
