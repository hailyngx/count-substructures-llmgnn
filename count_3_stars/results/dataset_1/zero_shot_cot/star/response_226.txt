Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (2, 5, 1)>

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 9)>

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 8)>

4. For node 3:
   - No 3-star as it has only two edges.

5. For node 4:
   - No 3-star as it has only one edge.

6. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 2, 1)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 7)>

7. For node 6:
   - No 3-star as it has only two edges.

8. For node 7:
   - No 3-star as it has only two edges.

9. For node 8:
   - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <8, (2, 5, 3)>
   - <8, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <8, (2, 3, 7)>

10. For node 9:
   - No 3-star as it has only two edges.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
