Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6,)>
<2, (5, 7,)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
