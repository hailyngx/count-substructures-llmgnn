Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (4, -1, -1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
