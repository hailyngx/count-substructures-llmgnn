Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are involved in at least one edge. These nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Since the 3-star graph consists of a central node with exactly three nodes connected to it, we need to check if there are any 3-stars present in the given graph.

Let's go through each node (0 to 9) one by one to see if they form a 3-star with three connected nodes:

For node 0:
- (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) form the 3-star <0, (1, 6, 8)>

For node 1:
- (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) form the 3-stars <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected only to node 9, so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) form the 3-stars <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>

For node 4:
- (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) form the 3-star <4, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 5:
- (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) form the 3-star <5, (1, 3, 6)>

For node 6:
- (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) form the 3-stars <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected only to node 1, so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 8:
- (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) form the 3-stars <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 9:
- (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) form the 3-star <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
