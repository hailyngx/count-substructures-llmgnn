Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each possible 3-star pattern. Then we check if these nodes and their connections form a valid 3-star. 

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Start by listing all combinations of nodes where one node is the center and three other nodes are connected to it. There will be a total of 10 * (10-1) * (10-2) * (10-3) = 720 combinations.

2. For each combination:
   - Determine if the central node has exactly 3 edges.
   - Check if the adjacent nodes are connected to the central node and not directly connected to each other.

3. Count the valid 3-stars and list them.

After examining all combinations, we should find the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Let's start the process.
