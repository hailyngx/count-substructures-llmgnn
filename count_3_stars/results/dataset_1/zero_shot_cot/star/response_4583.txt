Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes in the 3-stars can be any of the 10 nodes. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <2, (0, 6, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 9, 7)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
