Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. A 3-star consists of a central node and three connected nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (7, 3, 4)>
2. <2, (4, 3, 9)>
3. <3, (4, 5, 7)>
4. <4, (2, 3, 7)>
5. <5, (3, 6, 7)>
6. <6, (5)>
7. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
8. <8, (5, 7)>
9. <9, (2, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[9]
