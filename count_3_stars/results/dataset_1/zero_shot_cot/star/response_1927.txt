Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9, forming a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9. <0, (1, 9)>

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes 1, 0, 4, and 8. <1, (0, 4, 8)>

Considering node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to node 3. However, since it's not connected to two other nodes, it doesn't form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, 7, and 8. <3, (2, 7, 8)>

Moving to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8, forming two separate 3-stars: <4, (1, 6, 7)> and <4, (1, 7, 8)>. 

Considering node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. <5, (6, 7, 8)>

Moving on to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, 5, and 8. <6, (4, 5, 8)>

Considering node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, 4, 5, and 8. <7, (3, 4, 5, 8)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9, forming multiple 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, and <8, (3, 4, 5)>.

Finally, considering node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, forming a 3-star with nodes 9, 0, and 8. <9, (0, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified above, we get [10].
