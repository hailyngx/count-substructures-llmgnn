Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node for each potential 3-star. The central node must have degree 3. In this graph, nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 have degree 3.

Now, let's consider the nodes connected to each of these central nodes to form 3-stars. We will check all the combinations:

For central node 1:
- (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6) form a 3-star <1, (0, 5, 6)>

For central node 3:
- (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7) form a 3-star <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 4) form another 3-star <3, (7, 8, 4)>

For central node 4:
- (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9) form a 3-star <4, (3, 5, 9)>

For central node 5:
- (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7) form a 3-star <5, (1, 4, 7)>

For central node 7:
- (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8) form a 3-star <7, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [6].
