Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
