Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <3, (0, 8, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 8, 9)>
4. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <9, (4, 8, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
