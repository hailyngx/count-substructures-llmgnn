Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique instances of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 

<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
