Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central nodes:
- Node 0 has adjacent nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 1 has adjacent nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 2 has adjacent nodes 0, 5, and 7
- Node 3 has adjacent nodes 1, 7, and 9
- Node 4 has adjacent nodes 5 and 8
- Node 5 has adjacent nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 6 has adjacent nodes 0 and 1
- Node 7 has adjacent nodes 1, 2, and 3
- Node 8 has adjacent nodes 0 and 4
- Node 9 has adjacent nodes 0 and 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

[11]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
