Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-star graphs.

Nodes with three edges:
- Node 0
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9

Next, we will check each potential center node to see if it forms a 3-star with three other nodes. We will identify all unique 3-stars.

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (8, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
