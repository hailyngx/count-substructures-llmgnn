Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <1, (7, 4, 9)>
2. <3, (8, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (7, 1, 9)>
4. <5, (8, 3, 6)>
5. <6, (8, 9, 5)>
6. <7, (1, 4, 9)>
7. <8, (3, 5, 6)>
8. <9, (7, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
