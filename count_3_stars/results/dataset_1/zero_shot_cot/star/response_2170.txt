Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
