Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star has one central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, since all nodes have different degrees, we may not have any repeated 3-stars. Let's enumerate all the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 9, 4)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 9, 1)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 9, 1)>
<8, (1, 9, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
 
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
