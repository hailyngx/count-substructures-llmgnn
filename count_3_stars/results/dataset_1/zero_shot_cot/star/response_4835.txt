Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to the central node, we need to find nodes that have 3 adjacent edges. 

Let's list down the nodes along with their adjacent nodes:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 7} (4 edges) 
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7, 9} (5 edges)
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8, 9} (4 edges)
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6} (3 edges)
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8, 9} (5 edges)
- Node 5: {3} (1 edge)
- Node 6: {3, 4, 9} (3 edges)
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9} (5 edges)
- Node 8: {2, 4, 7} (3 edges)
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7} (5 edges)

Nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9 have 4 or more adjacent edges, making them potential centers of 3-stars. Let's list down the 3-stars with these potential central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get [18].
