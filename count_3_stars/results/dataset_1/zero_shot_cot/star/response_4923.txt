Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is linked to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges:  
Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 have exactly three edges attached to them.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star:
   - Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 6), (0, 2, 4, 8), (0, 2, 6, 8) (3 possibilities)
   - Node 2: (2, 0, 4, 5), (2, 0, 6, 7), (2, 4, 5, 6), (2, 5, 6, 8), (4 possibilities)
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 5), (4, 2, 5, 6), (4, 0, 5, 9) (3 possibilities)
   - Node 5: (5, 2, 3, 4), (5, 2, 4, 6), (5, 3, 4, 6) (3 possibilities)
   - Node 6: (6, 0, 2, 5), (6, 2, 5, 4), (6, 5, 4, 9) (3 possibilities)
   - Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 7), (8, 0, 7, 1), (8, 2, 7, 3) (3 possibilities)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
   - <8, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
