Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 2: (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 7), (3, 2, 9), (6, 2, 7)
2. Node 3: (4, 3, 9), (5, 3, 8), (8, 3, 5)
3. Node 6: (2, 6, 7), (7, 6, 8)
4. Node 7: (2, 7, 4), (6, 7, 2), (7, 2, 9)
5. Node 8: (1, 8, 3), (6, 8, 7)
6. Node 9: (3, 9, 2), (7, 9, 3)

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 0)>, 
<1, (2, 7, 1)>, 
<2, (0, 5, 2)>, 
<2, (1, 7, 2)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 2)>, 
<2, (9, 3, 2)>, 
<3, (9, 4, 3)>, 
<3, (8, 5, 3)>, 
<6, (7, 2, 6)>, 
<7, (4, 2, 7)>, 
<7, (2, 9, 7)>, 
<9, (2, 3, 9)>.
