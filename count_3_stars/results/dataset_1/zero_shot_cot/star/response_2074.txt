Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the center nodes and the leaves connected to them:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
1. <0, (4, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
4. <1, (2, 6, 7)>
5. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
6. <5, (2, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 4)>
9. <8, (1, 5, 7)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph.   
So the final answer is [10].
