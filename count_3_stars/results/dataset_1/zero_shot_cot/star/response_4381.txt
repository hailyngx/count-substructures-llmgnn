Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: (2, 4, 6) 
- Node 2: (0, 5, 6)
- Node 3: (5, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 6)
- Node 6: (0, 2, 4)
- Node 7: (2, 3, 4)
- Node 9: (2, 4, 7)

Considering each unique 3-star representation only once, we have the following:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
