Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we can identify all the nodes that are directly connected to node 2 since node 2 is the central node of the 3-star. We have nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8 directly connected to node 2.

Now, we need to check each of these nodes to see if they are connected to exactly two other nodes. If they are, then we have a 3-star.

1. For node 0, we see that it is connected only to node 2, so it cannot form a 3-star.

2. For node 3, it is directly connected to nodes 2 and 6. We can form a 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 2, 6, and 9 as the leaves. <3, (2, 6, 9)>

3. For node 7, it is directly connected to nodes 2 and 4. We can form a 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 2, 4, and 9 as the leaves. <7, (2, 4, 9)>

4. For node 8, it is directly connected to nodes 2, but it does not have any other connections and therefore cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [2].
