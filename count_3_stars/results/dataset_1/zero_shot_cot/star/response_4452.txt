Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them (i.e., the leaves of the 3-stars). These nodes are: 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
2. For each of these nodes, determine the other three nodes that form a 3-star with it.


The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, _)>

So, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
