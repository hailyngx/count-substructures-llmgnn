Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
   - Nodes with 3 edges: 0, 2, 5, 7

Step 2: For each node found in Step 1, check if the connected nodes form a 3-star pattern.
   - For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3) => <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   - For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7) => <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>
   - For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7) => <5, (2, 6, 7)>
   - For node 7: (7, 2), (7, 5) => <7, (2, 5, not available)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
   - Total unique 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>
