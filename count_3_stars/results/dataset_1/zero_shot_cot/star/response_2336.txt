Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (6, 7, -)>
3. <2, (7, 9, -)>
4. <3, (4, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 7, -)>
7. <6, (1, 3, -)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 5)>
9. <8, (3, - ,-)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
