Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes in the graph that have exactly three edges incident on them.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (7, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 8)>
3. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
7. <6, (3, 8, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 2, 5, 6)>
10. <9, (0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)>

Since all 3-stars have been listed, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
