Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections to make it easier to find the 3-stars.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Connections:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8

Next, let's find the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

[Number of 3-stars: 4]
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>
