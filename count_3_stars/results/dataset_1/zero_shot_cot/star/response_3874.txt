Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. We can do this by examining each node in turn and checking its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star configuration. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>  
<2, (0, 8, 9)>  
<3, (0, 8, -)>  
<5, (0, 1, 6)>  
<8, (0, 2, 3)>  
<9, (2, 5, 6)>  

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
