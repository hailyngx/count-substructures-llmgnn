Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for each node that connects to exactly three other nodes. Then, we'll identify the 3-stars centered around each of these nodes.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars: [7].
