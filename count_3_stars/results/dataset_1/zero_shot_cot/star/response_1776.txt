Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
- Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 3, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining all possible 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)> 
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)> inside brackets [].
