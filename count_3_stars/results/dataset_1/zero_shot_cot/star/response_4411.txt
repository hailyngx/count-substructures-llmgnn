Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 8, 8)>
5. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
6. <7, (1, 8, 8)>
7. <8, (1, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [7]
