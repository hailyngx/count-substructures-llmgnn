Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first find all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Considering the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
