Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Here they are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
