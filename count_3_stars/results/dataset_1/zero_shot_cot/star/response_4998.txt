Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
In this case, the nodes that satisfy this condition are 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star. 
- Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 4), (3, 0, 8), (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 4), (3, 1, 8), (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 3, 6), (4, 3, 7), (4, 3, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 1, 9), (8, 3, 4), (8, 9, 1), (8, 9, 5)
- Node 9: (9, 1, 5), (9, 8, 1), (9, 8, 5)

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found. 
There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars found.

[<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 9, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (8, 1, 5)>]
