Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's list out the nodes and their adjacent nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 1 is connected to Node 4 and Node 8
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to Node 5
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2 and 4
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, and 3
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 4 and 5

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- <2, (0, 3, 5)>  
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- [7]
