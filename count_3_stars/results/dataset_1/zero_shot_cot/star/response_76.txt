Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star structure present in the graph.

First, let's determine the possible 3-star structures in the graph:
- Node 0 has three neighbors: nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 1 has three neighbors: nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 2 has three neighbors: nodes 1, 4, and 6
- Node 3 has only two neighbors: nodes 7 and 9
- Node 4 has four neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8
- Node 5 has two neighbors: nodes 0 and 9
- Node 6 has two neighbors: nodes 0 and 2
- Node 7 has three neighbors: nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Node 8 has four neighbors: nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9
- Node 9 has four neighbors: nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 9)>
<6, (0, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [10].
