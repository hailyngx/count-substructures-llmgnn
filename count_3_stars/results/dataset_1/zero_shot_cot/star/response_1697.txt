Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, we will find the 3-stars in this graph.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Create a list of all nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0: (2, 3, 9)
- Node 1: (9)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 7, 8)
- Node 4: (2, 5, 8)
- Node 5: (4, 8)
- Node 6: (7)
- Node 7: (3, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 7, 8)

2. Identify the 3-stars:

- From the list above, we can see the possible 3-star combinations:
  - <0, (2, 3, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
  - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
  - <5, (4, 8)>
  - <7, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <8, (2, 4, 5)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 7)>, 
<4, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<5, (4, 8)>, 
<7, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<8, (2, 4, 5)>.
