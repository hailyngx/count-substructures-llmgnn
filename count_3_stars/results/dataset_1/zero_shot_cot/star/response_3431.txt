Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-stars in the given graph.

We can see that each 3-star will have one central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 8, 3)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>

So we have found two unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

<1, (4, 8, 3)> <4, (1, 3, 9)>
