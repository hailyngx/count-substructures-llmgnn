Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes with degree 3 (these can be central nodes of 3-stars). 

The nodes with degree 3 in the graph are: 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Let's now check all possible 3-star configurations for the identified central nodes:

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 8, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 9, 7)>

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 3:
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (5, 1, 9)>

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (9, 5, 1)>

For node 5:
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16]. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 8, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 9, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (5, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (9, 5, 1)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 9, 4)>
