Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 7)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 8)>
4. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
5. <8, (4, 7, 9)>
6. <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
