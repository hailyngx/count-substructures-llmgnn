Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (4, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.
Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 0, 8)>
<2, (1, 0, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
