Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all the unique 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Given the graph, the 3-stars are as follows:
1. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (6, 8, 9)>
3. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
5. <7, (3, 5, 9)>
6. <7, (5, 8, 9)>
7. <8, (1, 3, 4)>
8. <8, (3, 4, 7)>
9. <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
