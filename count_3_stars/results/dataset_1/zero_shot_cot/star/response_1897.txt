Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
