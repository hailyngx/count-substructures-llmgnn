Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Let's list the 3-star patterns <center_node, (leaf_node1, leaf_node2, leaf_node3)> present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<9, (0, 2, 1)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
