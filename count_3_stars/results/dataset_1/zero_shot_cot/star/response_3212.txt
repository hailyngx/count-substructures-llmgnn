Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 9: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <6, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are 3 3-stars in the given graph.  
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
