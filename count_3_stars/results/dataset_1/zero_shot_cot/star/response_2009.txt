Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be found by looking at each node and determining how many 3-star configurations it is a part of. 

Let's start with each node:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 6, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2: No 3-star configurations.
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 7, 9)>
5. Node 4: <4, (6, 7, 9)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star configurations.
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)> and <6, (0, 1, 5)>
8. Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 4)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star configurations.
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

<0, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>
