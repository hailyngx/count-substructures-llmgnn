Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify the central nodes of the potential 3-stars. We will then check if these central nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the 3-star structure.

Considering the given graph, the central nodes can be nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9 since these nodes have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes.

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
