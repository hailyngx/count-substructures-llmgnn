Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
