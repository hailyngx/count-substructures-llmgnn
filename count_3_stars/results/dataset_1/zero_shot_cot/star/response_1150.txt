Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9. This forms four 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, and <0, (3, 7, 9)>.

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. These connections do not form any 3-stars.

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. These connections do not form any 3-stars.

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7. This forms one 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 7)>.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. This forms one 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>.

- Node 5 is connected to node 9, but this connection does not form a 3-star.

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7. This forms one 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>.

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8. This forms two 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 6)> and <7, (0, 3, 8)>.

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. These connections do not form any 3-stars.

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. This forms one 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, and <7, (0, 3, 8)>.
