Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the latter two nodes are not directly connected to each other. 

Given the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the answer is [8].
