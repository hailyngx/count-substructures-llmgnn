Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 7)>
<8, (7, 1, 5)>
<9, (6, 2, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars we found above, the final answer is [9].
