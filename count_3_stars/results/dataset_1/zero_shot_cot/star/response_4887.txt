Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes in the graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, we will go through each node and check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes connected to it.

1. Node 0: <0, (4, 0, 4)> - Does not form a 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (7, 1, 7)> - Does not form a 3-star.
3. Node 2: <2, (3, 2, 3)>, <2, (4, 2, 4)>, <2, (7, 2, 7)>, <2, (8, 2, 8)>, and <2, (9, 2, 9)> - Forms 3-stars.
4. Node 3: <3, (2, 3, 2)>, <3, (4, 3, 4)>, <3, (6, 3, 6)>, and <3, (7, 3, 7)> - Forms 3-stars.
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 4, 0)>, <4, (2, 4, 2)>, <4, (3, 4, 3)>, <4, (5, 4, 5)>, <4, (6, 4, 6)>, and <4, (8, 4, 8)> - Forms 3-stars.
6. Node 5: <5, (4, 5, 4)>, <5, (6, 5, 6)> - Does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (3, 6, 3)>, <6, (4, 6, 4)>, <6, (5, 6, 5)>, and <6, (8, 6, 8)> - Forms 3-stars.
8. Node 7: <7, (1, 7, 1)>, <7, (2, 7, 2)>, <7, (3, 7, 3)> - Forms 3-stars.
9. Node 8: <8, (2, 8, 2)>, <8, (3, 8, 3)>, <8, (4, 8, 4)>, and <8, (6, 8, 6)> - Forms 3-stars.
10. Node 9: <9, (2, 9, 2)>, <9, (6, 9, 6)>, and <9, (8, 9, 8)> - Forms 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 2, 3)>, <2, (4, 2, 4)>, <2, (7, 2, 7)>, <2, (8, 2, 8)>, <2, (9, 2, 9)>,
<3, (2, 3, 2)>, <3, (4, 3, 4)>, <3, (6, 3, 6)>, <3, (7, 3, 7)>,
<4, (0, 4, 0)>, <4, (2, 4, 2)>, <4, (3, 4, 3)>, <4, (5, 4, 5)>, <4, (6, 4, 6)>.
