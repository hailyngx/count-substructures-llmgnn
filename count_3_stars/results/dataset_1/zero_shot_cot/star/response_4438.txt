Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

1. 3-star with central node 0: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. 3-star with central node 2: <2, (0, 4, 9)>
3. 3-star with central node 3: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
4. 3-star with central node 4: <4, (0, 2, 7)>
5. 3-star with central node 5: <5, (3, 6, )>
6. 3-star with central node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)>
7. 3-star with central node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
