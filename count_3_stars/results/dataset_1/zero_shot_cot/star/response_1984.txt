Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. We will then count the unique 3-stars formed by each central node.

The central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

For each central node, we will list the connected nodes:

- Central node: 0
  Connected nodes: 1, 2, 9
  3-stars formed: <0, (1, 2, 9)>

- Central node: 1
  Connected nodes: 0, 2
  3-stars formed: <1, (0, 2)>

- Central node: 2
  Connected nodes: 0, 1, 4
  3-stars formed: <2, (0, 1, 4)>

- Central node: 3
  Connected nodes: 4, 8
  3-stars formed: <3, (4, 8)>

- Central node: 4
  Connected nodes: 2, 3, 9
  3-stars formed: <4, (2, 3, 9)>

- Central node: 5
  Connected nodes: 9
  3-stars formed: <5, (9)>

- Central node: 6
  Connected nodes: 8
  3-stars formed: <6, (8)>

- Central node: 8
  Connected nodes: 3, 6, 9
  3-stars formed: <8, (3, 6, 9)>

- Central node: 9
  Connected nodes: 0, 4, 5, 8
  3-stars formed: <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
