Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 2
Node 2: 1, 3, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7
Node 5: 0, 3, 7
Node 6: 0, 4
Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 2, 3

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph where each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node:

[6]

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
