Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 9, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 9, -)>    (Note: Only 2 nodes are connected to node 7)
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
