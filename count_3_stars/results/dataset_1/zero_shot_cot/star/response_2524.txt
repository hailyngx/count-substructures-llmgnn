Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (0, 4, 9)>
2. <3, (7, 8, 9)>
3. <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
