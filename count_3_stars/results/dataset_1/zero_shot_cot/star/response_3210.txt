Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique configurations of a central node and its three connected nodes (leaves). Let's go step-by-step by looking at each node as the potential central node and checking if it forms a 3-star based on the given edges.

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 9)
    <0, (1, 3, 8)>
    Total: 1

2. Node 1:
    - (1, 0), (1, 5), (1, 8)
    <1, (0, 5, 8)>
    Total: 2

3. Node 2:
    - (2, 3), (2, 5)
    No 3-star

4. Node 3:
    - (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)
    <3, (0, 2, 4)>
    Total: 3

5. Node 4:
    - (4, 3), (4, 5)
    No 3-star

6. Node 5:
    - (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7)
    <5, (1, 2, 3)>
    <5, (1, 3, 4)>
    Total: 5

7. Node 7:
    - (7, 5), (7, 9)
    No 3-star

8. Node 8:
    - (8, 0), (8, 1)
    No 3-star

9. Node 9:
    - (9, 0), (9, 7)
    No 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>
