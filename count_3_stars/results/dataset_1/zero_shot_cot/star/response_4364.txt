Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-star graph: [6]
