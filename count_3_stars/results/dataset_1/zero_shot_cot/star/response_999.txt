Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
   - <0, (3, 8)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
   - <1, (4, 8, 9)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
   - <2, (5, 7)>

4. Node 3 is connected to node 0.
   - No 3-star for node 3.

5. Node 4 is connected to node 1.
   - No 3-star for node 4.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
   - <5, (2, 6, 7)>

7. Node 6 is connected to node 5.
   - No 3-star for node 6.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
   - <7, (2, 5, 8)>

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
   - <8, (0, 1, 9)> and <8, (6, 9, 1)>

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
    - No 3-star for node 9.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 8)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>
