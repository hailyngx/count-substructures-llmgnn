Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.  
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.  
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.  
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.  
    - There are three unique 3-stars in the given graph.  

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars.  
    - <8, (0, 3, 5)>  
    - <6, (2, 4, 9)>  
    - <9, (5, 6, 8)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
