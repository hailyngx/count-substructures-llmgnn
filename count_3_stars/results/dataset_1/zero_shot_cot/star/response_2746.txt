Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- 1: 7
- 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- 3: 0, 2, 8, 9
- 4: 0, 6
- 5: 0, 2, 6
- 6: 4, 5
- 7: 0, 1, 2
- 8: 2, 3
- 9: 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 2)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 0, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 0, 8)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
