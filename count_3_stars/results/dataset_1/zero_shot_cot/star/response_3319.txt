Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
