Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Nodes connected to three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

Next, let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
