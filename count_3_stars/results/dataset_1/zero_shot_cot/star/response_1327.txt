Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7.

Now, we can count the 3-stars in the graph by finding all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
