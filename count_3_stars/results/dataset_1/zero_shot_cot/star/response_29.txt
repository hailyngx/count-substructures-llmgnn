Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars. 

Starting with the 0-th node:
- 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 6)>

Moving on to the 1st node:
- 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- 3-star: <1, (3, 8, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
[<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>]
