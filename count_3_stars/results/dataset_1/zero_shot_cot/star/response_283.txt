Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through all the nodes and identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to: 2, 9
  <0, (2, 9)>

- Node 1 is connected to: 8, 9
  <1, (8, 9)>

- Node 2 is connected to: 0, 5, 9
  <2, (0, 5, 9)>

- Node 3 is connected to: 5, 9
  <3, (5, 9)>

- Node 4 is connected to: 7, 9
  <4, (7, 9)>

- Node 6 is connected to: 9
  <6, (9)>

- Node 7 is connected to: 4, 5
  <7, (4, 5)>

- Node 8 is connected to: 1, 9
  <8, (1, 9)>

From the above analysis, we have found all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. Counting them, we get a total of 8 3-stars. Hence, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
