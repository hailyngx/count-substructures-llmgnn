Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars by checking each node as the potential center of the star and then verifying if it satisfies the definition of a 3-star. 

Here are the steps we will follow:
1. Identify all nodes as potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center node, identify the neighboring nodes connected by edges.
3. Check if the neighboring nodes form a 3-star around the center node. If yes, count it as a valid 3-star.

Let's start with the process:
1. Nodes as potential centers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Checking each potential center:
- For node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9)
- For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3)
- For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8)
  <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 4)>
- For node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6)
- For node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7)
- For node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
- For node 7: (7, 5), (7, 8)
- For node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9)
- For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 8)

There is a total of 4 unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
