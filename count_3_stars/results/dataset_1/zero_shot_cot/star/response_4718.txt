Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (8, 2, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
