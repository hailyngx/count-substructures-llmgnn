Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-pattern.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges:
    - Node 0 has edges with nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9.
    - Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.
    - Node 5 has edges with nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
    - Node 9 has edges with nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.

2. Look for 3-stars involving the identified nodes:
    - <0, 3, 4, 5>
    - <4, 0, 1, 9>
    - <5, 0, 6, 9>
    - <9, 0, 4, 5> 

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 3, 4, 5>
<4, 0, 1, 9>
<5, 0, 6, 9>
<9, 0, 4, 5>
