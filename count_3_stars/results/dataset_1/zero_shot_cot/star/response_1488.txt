Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7, forming a 3-star with node 0 as the center. 
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8, forming a 3-star with node 1 as the center. 
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7, forming a 3-star with node 3 as the center. 
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center. 
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4, forming a 3-star with node 8 as the center. 

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are: 
<0, (5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7)>
<4, (3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
