Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first find the nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0 has 2 edges
- Node 2 has 1 edge
- Node 6 has 1 edge
- Node 8 has 3 edges

So, the potential centers for 3-stars are nodes 0, 6, and 8. 

Now, let's check the possible 3-stars involving these potential centers:

For node 0:
- <0, (1, 5)> is a 3-star

For node 6:
- No 3-stars exist with node 6 as the center since it only has 1 edge.

For node 8:
- <8, (1, 5)> is a 3-star
- <8, (5, 9)> is a 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5)> and <8, (1, 5)> and <8, (5, 9)>.
