Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes. 

Let's first find all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. For node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9)
   <0, (3, 4, 9)>
2. For node 1: (1, 4), (1, 9)
   <1, (4, 9)>
3. For node 2: (2, 3), (2, 8)
   <2, (3, 8)>
4. For node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2)
   <3, (0, 2)>
5. For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1)
   <4, (0, 1)>
6. For node 5: (5, 9)
   <5, (9)>
7. For node 8: (8, 2)
   <8, (2)>
8. For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5)
   <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].  
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 9)>, <2, (3, 8)>, <3, (0, 2)>, <4, (0, 1)>, <5, (9)>, <8, (2)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>
