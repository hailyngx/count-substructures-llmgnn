Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree = 3) to find the 3-stars.

The nodes and their degrees are:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 5
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2

Next, we will list out the 3-stars:

<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

Count the unique 3-stars: [6]
