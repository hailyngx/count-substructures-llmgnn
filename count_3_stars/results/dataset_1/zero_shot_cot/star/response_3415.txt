Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in the graph:

- Node 6 is the central node and it is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.

Now, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (6, 7, 0)>
3. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <5, (6, 9, 9)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 4)>
6. <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we have [6].
