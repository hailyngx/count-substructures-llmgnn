Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations of a central node connected to three other nodes. 

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's find the 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>

2. For Node 1:
    - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    
3. For Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <3, (2, 7, 9)>

4. For Node 5:
    - <5, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <5, (1, 4, 8)>

5. For Node 8:
    - <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
