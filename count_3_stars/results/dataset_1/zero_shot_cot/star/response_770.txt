Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Now that we have listed all the unique 3-stars in the given graph, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
