Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 4, 6)
Node 1: (1, 4, 8)
Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 5, 7)
Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 7, 4)
Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 8, 7)
Node 5: (5, 2, 6), (5, 7, 6)
Node 6: (6, 0, 5)
Node 7: (7, 2, 5), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 8)
Node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 7, 4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (4, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
