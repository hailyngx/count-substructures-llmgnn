Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars by locating nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. Then, we will count how many such 3-stars exist in the graph.

Given the edges provided, we can identify which nodes have exactly 3 neighbors by examining the edges:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9 (7 neighbors)

From the above list, we determined that nodes 2 and 7 have exactly 3 neighbors each.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
2. 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
3. 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (7, 8, 9)>

5. 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)>
6. 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (1, 2, 3)>
7. 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (1, 2, 5)>
8. 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] unique 3-stars in the graph.
