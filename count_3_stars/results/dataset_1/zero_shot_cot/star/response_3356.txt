Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 3)

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>
