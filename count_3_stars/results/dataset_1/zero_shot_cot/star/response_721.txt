Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible combinations of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's analyze the connections for each node:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8
- Node 5: Connected to node 3
- Node 6: Connected to node 4
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1 and 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 7 and 8

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node as the potential center of a 3-star.
