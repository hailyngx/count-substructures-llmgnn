Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be our potential central nodes for 3-stars. 

Based on the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 7.

Next, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 5, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
