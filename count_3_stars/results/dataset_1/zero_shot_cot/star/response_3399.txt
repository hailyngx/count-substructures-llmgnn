Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.

To count the number of 3-stars, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can see that node 8 fits the criteria of being connected to exactly three other nodes, which are nodes 1, 3, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 3, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <8, (1, 3, 6)>.
