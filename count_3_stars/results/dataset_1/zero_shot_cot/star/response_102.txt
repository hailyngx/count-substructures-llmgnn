Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- The central node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8: <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- The central node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- The central node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6: <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- The central node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2: <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- The central node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9: <9, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
