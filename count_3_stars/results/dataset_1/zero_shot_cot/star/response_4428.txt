Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 6, 7, 9
   Possible 3-stars: <0, (6, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 7
   No 3-stars can be formed as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

3. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 7
   Possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 7)>

4. Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 8
   No 3-stars can be formed as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

5. Node 5: Connected to node 3
   No 3-stars can be formed as it's not connected to at least 3 other nodes.

6. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 8, 9
   No 3-stars can be formed as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

7. Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
   Possible 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>

8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 6
   No 3-stars can be formed as it's not connected to at least 3 other nodes.

9. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 6, 7
   No 3-stars can be formed as it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>.
