Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 0 as the center.

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (0, 5, 9)>

3. For node 2:
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 2 as the center.

4. For node 3:
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 3 as the center.

5. For node 4:
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 4 as the center.

6. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <5, (0, 8, 9)>

7. For node 6: 
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 6 as the center.

8. For node 7:
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 7 as the center.

9. For node 8:
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 8 as the center.

10. For node 9:
   - <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
