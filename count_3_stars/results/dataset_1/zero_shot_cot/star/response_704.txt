Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes and their connected nodes based on the definition of a 3-star graph.

The central nodes are nodes that have exactly 3 adjacent edges. Let's identify them first:

- Node 0 has 2 adjacent edges (0, 7) and (0, 9).
- Node 1 has 1 adjacent edge (1, 6).
- Node 2 has 2 adjacent edges (2, 8) and (2, 9).
- Node 3 has 1 adjacent edge (3, 4).
- Node 4 has 1 adjacent edge (4, 3).
- Node 6 has 1 adjacent edge (6, 1).
- Node 7 has 2 adjacent edges (7, 0) and (7, 9).
- Node 8 has 2 adjacent edges (8, 2) and (8, 9).
- Node 9 has 6 adjacent edges (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 8), (0, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9).

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph by considering the central nodes and their connected nodes:

1. <0, (7, 9)> (center: 0, leaves: 7, 9)
2. <2, (8, 9)> (center: 2, leaves: 8, 9)
3. <7, (0, 9)> (center: 7, leaves: 0, 9)
4. <8, (2, 9)> (center: 8, leaves: 2, 9)
5. <9, (0, 2, 3, 7, 8)> (center: 9, leaves: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
