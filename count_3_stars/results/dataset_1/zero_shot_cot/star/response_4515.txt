Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph based on the given edges and count the number of 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8, forming a 3-star with 0 as the center: <0, (4, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7, but this does not form a 3-star because node 1 does not have degree 3.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, but this does not form a 3-star because node 2 does not have degree 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 4, but this does not form a 3-star because node 3 does not have degree 3.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3, forming a 3-star with 4 as the center: <4, (0, 3)>
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star with 5 as the center: <5, (2, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9, but none of these connections form a 3-star because node 6 does not have exactly 3 connections to form a star.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 1, but this does not form a 3-star because node 7 does not have degree 3.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9, forming a 3-star with 8 as the center: <8, (0, 5, 6)>
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8, but this does not form a 3-star because node 9 does not have degree 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 8)> and <5, (2, 6, 8)>.
