Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's go step-by-step to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has edges to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8, making it a center node for three unique 3-stars:
   <0, (2, 5, 7)>
   <0, (2, 5, 8)>
   <0, (2, 7, 8)>

2. Node 2 has edges to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9, making it a center node for one unique 3-star:
   <2, (0, 1, 5)>

3. Node 4 has edges to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9, making it a center node for one unique 3-star:
   <4, (2, 3, 9)>

4. Node 5 has edges to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6, making it a center node for one unique 3-star:
   <5, (0, 2, 6)>

In total, we have 6 unique 3-stars as described above. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
