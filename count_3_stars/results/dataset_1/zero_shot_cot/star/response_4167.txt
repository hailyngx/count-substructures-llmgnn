Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided. 

Given the edges:
- (0, 4)
- (0, 6)
- (1, 2)
- (1, 6)
- (2, 1)
- (2, 4)
- (2, 7)
- (2, 9)
- (3, 7)
- (4, 0)
- (4, 2)
- (4, 9)
- (5, 8)
- (6, 0)
- (6, 1)
- (6, 7)
- (7, 2)
- (7, 3)
- (7, 6)
- (7, 8)
- (8, 5)
- (8, 7)
- (9, 2)
- (9, 4)

We can now list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (7)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get [11].
