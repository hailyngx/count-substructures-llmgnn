Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly 3 edges connected to it, forming a 3-star pattern.

Given graph:
- 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 28 edges

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, -)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, -,-)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars found. So, the output is: [7].
