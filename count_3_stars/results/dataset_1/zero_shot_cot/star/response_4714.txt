Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star configuration.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 1, 3)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 9, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

[10]
