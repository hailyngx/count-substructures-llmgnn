Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the node degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 1
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 1

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
