Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 9
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 4
Node 3: 1, 2
Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 1
Node 7: 4, 5, 9
Node 8: 4, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors in the graph.

The nodes that meet this criteria are:
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 6: 1

Therefore, there are three 3-stars in the graph.

[3]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2)>
<6, (1)>
