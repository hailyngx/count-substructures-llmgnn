Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here's the breakdown of 3-star configurations:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 8), (0, 5, 8) 
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 4, 6), (2, 5, 7)
4. Node 4: (4, 2, 8)
5. Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 2, 6)
6. Node 6: (6, 2, 9)
7. Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 1, 4) 
8. Node 9: (9, 2, 6), (9, 4, 6)

So, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in this graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8)>
<2, (4, 6)>
<2, (5, 7)>
<4, (2, 8)>
<5, (0, 2)>
<5, (2, 6)>
<6, (2, 9)>
<8, (0, 1)>
<8, (1, 4)>
<9, (2, 6)>
<9, (4, 6)>
