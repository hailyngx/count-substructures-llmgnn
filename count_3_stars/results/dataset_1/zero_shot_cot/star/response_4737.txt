Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the graph.  
- Node 0, 3, 5, and 8 have degree 3, so they can be central nodes.  

Step 2: For each central node, identify the adjacent nodes and check if they form a 3-star.  
- For central node 0: (0, 3, 5), and (0, 3, 8) are 3-stars.  
- For central node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 4, 7), and (3, 5, 7) are 3-stars.  
- For central node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 3, 6) are 3-stars.  
- For central node 8: (8, 0, 4) and (8, 4, 7) are 3-stars.  

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.  
- Total number of 3-stars: 7  

[Total number of 3-stars: <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3)>, <0, (3, 8)>, <3, (4, 7)>, <3, (5, 7)> ]
