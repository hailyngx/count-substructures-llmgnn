Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node along with its three connected nodes. Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, then it is the center of a 3-star.

2. List the connected nodes with the center node to form a 3-star.

Let's start analyzing the given graph:

- Node 0 is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8. So, a 3-star is formed with node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 3, and 8 as leaves. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9, but it is also connected to more than three nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9, but it is also connected to more than three nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, but it is also connected to more than three nodes.
- Nodes 5, 6, and 7 are not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6. So, a 3-star is formed with node 8 as the center and nodes 1, 4, and 6 as leaves. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, but it is also connected to more than three nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 8)> and <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
