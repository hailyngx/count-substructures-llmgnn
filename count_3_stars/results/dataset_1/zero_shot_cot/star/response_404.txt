Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
5. <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
