Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (2, 1, 5)>
<0, (2, 1, 6)>
<0, (2, 1, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 0, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the graph.
