Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9: <5, (0, 9)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3: <7, (0, 2, 3)>
5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6: <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
