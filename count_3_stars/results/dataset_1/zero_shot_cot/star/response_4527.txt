Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 7, -)>  
<2, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (5, 6, 8)>  
<4, (2, 8, -)>  
<5, (1, 3, 6)>  
<6, (2, 3, 5)>  
<7, (1, 2, -)>  
<8, (3, 4, 5)>  
<9, (3, -, -)>  

Counting the unique 3-stars from the list, we get 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
