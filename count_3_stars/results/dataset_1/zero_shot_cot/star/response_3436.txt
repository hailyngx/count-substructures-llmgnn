Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7: <5, (4, 6, 7)>
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7: <8, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
