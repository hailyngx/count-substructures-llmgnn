Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three adjacent nodes connected to it.

Starting with each node as a potential center of a 3-star:
- Node 0: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 1: It is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. Among these, nodes 2, 3, and 5 form a 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 3, 5)>.
- Node 2: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 3: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 4: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 5: It is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Among these, nodes 1, 2, and 3 form a 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 2, 3)>.
- Node 6: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 7: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 8: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
- Node 9: Does not have exactly three adjacent nodes, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the only 3-star in the given graph is <1, (2, 3, 5)>.

So, the final answer is [1].
