Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique set of nodes that form a 3-star. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. **Identify Central Nodes:**
    - Central nodes are those nodes which have exactly three edges connected to them.
    
2. **Identify 3-Stars:**
    - For each central node, identify the three nodes connected to it by edges. This forms a 3-star configuration.

Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the graph:
- Node 3 and Node 8 are the central nodes because they both have three edges connected to them.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
1. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
2. <8, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
