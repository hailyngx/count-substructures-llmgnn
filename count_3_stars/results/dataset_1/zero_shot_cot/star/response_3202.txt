Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that can be considered as the central node and multiplying that by 3 (since each central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in a 3-star graph).

1. Possible 3-stars with central node 0:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
Total: 1

2. Possible 3-stars with central node 1:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
Total: 1

3. Possible 3-stars with central node 2:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
Total: 2

4. Possible 3-stars with central node 3:
<3, (2, 7, 4)>
Total: 1

5. Possible 3-stars with central node 4:
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
Total: 1

6. Possible 3-stars with central node 5:
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
Total: 1

7. Possible 3-stars with central node 6:
<6, (9, 5, 0)>
Total: 1

8. Possible 3-stars with central node 7:
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
Total: 1

9. Possible 3-stars with central node 8:
<8, (2, 5, 4)>
Total: 1

10. Possible 3-stars with central node 9:
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 7, 6)>
Total: 2

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (9, 5, 0)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 6)> inside <> each only once.
