Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

As a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by listing all the possible 3-stars based on the information provided. Then we will eliminate any duplicates to ensure each 3-star is listed only once. Finally, we will count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

There are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
