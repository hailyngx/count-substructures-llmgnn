Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Based on the definition provided, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star.

For the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8.

After checking each node, we can see that there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 2, 9)>
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (3, 9, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
