Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars. Central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

In this graph, the potential central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. 

Next, we will check each potential central node to see if they form a 3-star. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7, forming a 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 7)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7, forming a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 7)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 does not have exactly 3 edges, so it cannot be a central node of a 3-star.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6, but it only has 2 edges, so it cannot be a central node of a 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 does not have exactly 3 edges, so it cannot be a central node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
