Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 9
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[4]

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
