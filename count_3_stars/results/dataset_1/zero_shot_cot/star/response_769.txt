Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
