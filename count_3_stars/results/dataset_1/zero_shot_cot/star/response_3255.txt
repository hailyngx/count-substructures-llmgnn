Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 9)>
3. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
4. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
5. <0, (2, 7, 9)>
6. <0, (3, 5, 8)>
7. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
8. <3, (0, 4, 8)>
9. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
10. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
11. <4, (0, 6, 8)>
12. <4, (3, 5, 6)>
13. <5, (1, 3, 6)>
14. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
15. <5, (2, 4, 7)>
16. <5, (2, 6, 7)>
17. <5, (2, 7, 9)>
18. <6, (2, 4, 8)>
19. <8, (0, 3, 4)>
20. <8, (0, 6, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
