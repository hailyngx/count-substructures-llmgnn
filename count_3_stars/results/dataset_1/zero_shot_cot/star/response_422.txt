Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 0, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 0, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 0, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 5)>
<7, (6, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
