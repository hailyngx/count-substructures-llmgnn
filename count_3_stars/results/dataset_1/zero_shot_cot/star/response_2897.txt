Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them since those nodes could be the centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9.

Now, let's check for 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as potential centers:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- By connecting node 1, 3, and 7 to node 0, we find one 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 7)>.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 9.
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.
- By connecting node 0, 5, and 7 to node 3, we find one 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8.
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7.
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are two 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (1, 3, 7)> and <3, (0, 5, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
