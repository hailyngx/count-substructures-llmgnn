Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<5, (3, 9, 6)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 1, 6)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [17]
