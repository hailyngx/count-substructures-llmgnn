Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes. 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.

So, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 9, out of star)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
