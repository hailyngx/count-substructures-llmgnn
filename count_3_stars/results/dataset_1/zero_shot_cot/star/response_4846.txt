Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition given. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars we can find:

<0, (1, 5, 1)>
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

So the final answer is: [7].
