Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes in the graph. From the given edges, we have nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Next, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Since the total degree of the graph is even (22 edges), the number of nodes in the graph is even. Therefore, we need to find 3-stars using the existing nodes.

Now let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
