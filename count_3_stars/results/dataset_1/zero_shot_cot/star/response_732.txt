Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node in each 3-star in the graph. 
From the given edges, we can see that the central node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars formed with node 0 as the center. 
Count how many 3-stars are formed with node 0 as the center. 

[<0, (2, 3, 5)>]

Therefore, there is only one 3-star with node 0 as the center.  

Finally, we can output the count of 3-stars in the given graph inside brackets.
