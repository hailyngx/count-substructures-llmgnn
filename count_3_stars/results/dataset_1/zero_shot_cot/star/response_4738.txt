Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all 3-stars in the given graph based on the provided edges. 
Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph: 

<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (7, 9, -)>
<2, (4, 8, -)>
<3, (6, 7, -)>
<5, (9, -, -)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 9, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
