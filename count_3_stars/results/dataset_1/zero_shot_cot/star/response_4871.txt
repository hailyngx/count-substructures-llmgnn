Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 2
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 6
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 3

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with its three neighbors: (0, 4, 9), (2, 4, 5), (7, 8, 9)
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with its three neighbors: (2, 7, 9)

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>
