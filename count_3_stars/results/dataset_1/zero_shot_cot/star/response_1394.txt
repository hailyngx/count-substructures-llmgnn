Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7. There is a 3-star centered at node 1 with leaves 0, 6, 7 <1, (0, 6, 7)>.

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8. There is a 3-star centered at node 4 with leaves 1, 5, 6 <4, (1, 5, 6)>.

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7. There is a 3-star centered at node 5 with leaves 1, 4, 7 <5, (1, 4, 7)>.

Count of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 7)> <4, (1, 5, 6)> <5, (1, 4, 7)>
