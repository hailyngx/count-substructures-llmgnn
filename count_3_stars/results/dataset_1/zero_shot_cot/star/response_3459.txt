Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <3, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <5, (3, 8, 9)>
4. <6, (3, 7, 9)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 6)>
6. <8, (3, 5, 9)>
7. <9, (1, 3, 8)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
