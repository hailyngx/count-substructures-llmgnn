Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

In this graph, nodes 0, 2, and 7 have exactly three neighbors each. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
