Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1, node 2, and node 4 since these are potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

For node 1: Node 2 and Node 7 are connected to Node 1.

For node 2: Node 1 and Node 6 are connected to Node 2.

For node 4: Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9 are connected to Node 4.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
1. Number of 3-stars with Node 1 as the center: 0 (since nodes 2 and 7 are not connected).
2. Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: 0 (since nodes 1 and 6 are not connected).
3. Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center: 1 (<4, (3, 8, 9)>).

Therefore, [1] unique 3-star is present in the given graph.
