Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 0: <0, (2, 6, 6)>
2. From node 2: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
3. From node 3: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
4. From node 4: <4, (5, 8, 8)>
5. From node 5: <5, (3, 4, 7)>
6. From node 6: <6, (0, 3, 3)>
7. From node 7: <7, (3, 5, 5)>
8. From node 8: <8, (2, 4, 4)>
9. From node 9: <9, (2, _, _)>
