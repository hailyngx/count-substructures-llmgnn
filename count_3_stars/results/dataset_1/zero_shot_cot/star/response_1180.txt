Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph.

The possible central nodes can be: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9. 

Now, we will check each central node along with its adjacent nodes to find 3-stars:

1. For node 0: 
    - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. For node 1: 
    - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
3. For node 2:
    - <2, (1, 5, 9)>
4. For node 4:
    - No 3-stars as it has only 2 adjacent nodes.
5. For node 5:
    - <5, (2, 4, 8)>
    - <5, (8, 5, 9)>
6. For node 8:
    - <8, (0, 5, 9)>
7. For node 9:
    - <9, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <9, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <9, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>,
<1, (0, 2, 9)>,
<2, (1, 5, 9)>,
<5, (2, 4, 8)>,
<5, (8, 5, 9)>,
<8, (0, 5, 9)>,
<9, (0, 1, 5)>,
<9, (1, 2, 9)>.
