Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the center node of a 3-star must have degree 3.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
