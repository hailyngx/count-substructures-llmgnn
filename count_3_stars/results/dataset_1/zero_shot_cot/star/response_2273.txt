Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

From the provided list of edges, we can determine the following 3-star graphs:
- 3-star with center at node 0: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- 3-star with center at node 1: <1, (4, 9, -)>
- 3-star with center at node 3: <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- 3-star with center at node 4: <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- 3-star with center at node 5: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- 3-star with center at node 9: <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 9, -)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
