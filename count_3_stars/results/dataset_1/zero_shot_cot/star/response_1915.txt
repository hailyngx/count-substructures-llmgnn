Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-star structures.

Upon examining the provided edges, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
