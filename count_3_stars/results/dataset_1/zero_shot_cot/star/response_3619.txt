Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can act as the center of the 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 4.
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 9.
4. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, and 7.
6. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, and 9.
7. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
8. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
