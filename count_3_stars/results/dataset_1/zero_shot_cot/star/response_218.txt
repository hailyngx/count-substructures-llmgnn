Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (8, 2, -)>
<4, (1, -, -)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, -, -)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, -, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
