Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 0, as this will help us identify the 3-stars centered at node 0.  
Nodes connected to node 0 are: 3, 5, 9.  
Now, we can see that there are 3-stars centered at node 0 with leaves 3, 5, 9.  

Next, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 1, 2, 4, 7.  
Nodes connected to node 1 are: 9.  
Nodes connected to node 2 are: 6, 8.  
Nodes connected to node 4 are: 5, 8.  
Nodes connected to node 7 are: 5, 6.  
However, none of these nodes have a 3-star configuration.

Now, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 6.  
Nodes connected to node 6 are: 2, 5, 7, 9.  
Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, 9.  

Finally, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 8.  
Nodes connected to node 8 are: 2, 3, 4, 9.  
Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:  
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>
