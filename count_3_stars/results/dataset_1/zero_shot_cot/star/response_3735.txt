Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes could potentially be central nodes of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with exactly three edges are:
- Node 4: connected to nodes 7, 9, and 7
- Node 8: connected to nodes 0, 6, and 0

Next, let's check if these nodes form 3-stars with valid leaves.

For Node 4:
- Node 7 has two edges: (4, 7) and (7, 5). Therefore, Node 7 cannot be part of a 3-star with Node 4 as the center.

For Node 8:
- Node 0 has four edges: (8, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), and (0, 5). Therefore, Node 0 cannot be part of a 3-star with Node 8 as the center.
- Node 6 has five edges: (8, 6), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), and (6, 9). Therefore, Node 6 can be part of a 3-star with Node 8 as the center. The unique 3-star in this case is <8, (0, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
