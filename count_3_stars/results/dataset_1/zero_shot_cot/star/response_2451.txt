Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-star graphs.  
    - Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 5, 7, 9 
    - Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 7, 8, 9  
    - Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 4, 6 
    - Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 2, 6  

Step 2: Check if the nodes that are connected to potential centers form a 3-star graph. 
    - For node 0: (0, 5, 7, 9) - Not a 3-star as 5, 7, and 9 are not directly connected. 
    - For node 1: (1, 7, 8, 9) - Not a 3-star as 7, 8, and 9 are not directly connected. 
    - For node 3: (3, 2, 4, 6) - Not a 3-star as 2, 4, and 6 are not directly connected. 
    - For node 8: (8, 1, 2, 6) - Not a 3-star as 1, 2, and 6 are not directly connected. 

Step 3: Calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
    - There are no valid 3-star graphs in the given graph.
