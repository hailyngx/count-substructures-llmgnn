Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we need to analyze the graph to find the 3-stars. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to node 2.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.

2. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - <0, (6, 9)>
   - <1, (2, 8)>
   - <2, (1, 3, 7)> 
   - <4, (7, 9)>
   - <5, (7, 9)>
   - <6, (0, 9)>
   - <7, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <9, (0, 2, 4, 5, 6)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - There are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
