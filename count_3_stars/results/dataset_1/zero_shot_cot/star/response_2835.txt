Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 2 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 5, and 6. 
   <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   
2. Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 1 and 7.
   <3, (1, 7, 7)>
   
3. Node 7 can form 3-stars with nodes 2, 3, and 5. 
   <7, (2, 3, 5)>
   
4. Node 8 can form a 3-star with node 9. 
   <8, (9, 7, 9)>
   
Counting the unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (9, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
