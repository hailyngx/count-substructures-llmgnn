Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star <0, (6, 7, 8)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 7. This forms a 3-star <1, (7, 0, 0)>.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 8. This forms a 3-star <3, (8, 0, 0)>.
4. Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <2, (4, 9, 0)> and <4, (2, 9, 0)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 0, 0)>, <3, (8, 0, 0)>, <2, (4, 9, 0)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
