Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by finding each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.

2. Let's list the 3-stars we found:
<3, (0, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 8, 3)>
<8, (3, 0, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>

3. Finally, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
   The total number of 3-stars is [4].
