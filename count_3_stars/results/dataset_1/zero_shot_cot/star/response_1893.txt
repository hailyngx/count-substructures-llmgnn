Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify nodes that are connected to exactly three nodes, forming a 3-star in the graph:

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2)

Based on the given edges, we can determine the 3-stars:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 8)>
<6, (1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
