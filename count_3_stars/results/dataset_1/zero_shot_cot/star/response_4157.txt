Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. Then, we can check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star with the appropriate connections.

From the given graph, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 7
- Node 9

Let's now check each of these nodes to find the 3-stars in the graph.

- For Node 2:
    - (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 7) form a 3-star. `<2, (0, 3, 7)>`

- For Node 3:
    - (3, 2), (3, 8) do not form a 3-star with 3 as the central node.

- For Node 7:
    - (7, 2), (7, 9) form a 3-star. `<7, (2, 9)>`

- For Node 9:
    - (9, 4), (9, 7) do not form a 3-star with 9 as the central node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are: `<2, (0, 3, 7)>` and `<7, (2, 9)>`.
