Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9 but only node 3 satisfies the condition.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8 but none of the neighbors satisfy the condition.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0 and 1 but only node 1 satisfies the condition.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5 and 9 but none of the neighbors satisfy the condition.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8 but none of the neighbors satisfy the condition.
- Node 6: Connected to node 2 but the neighbor doesn't satisfy the condition.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8 which satisfy the condition.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9 but nodes 7 and 9 satisfy the condition.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8 but nodes 1 and 8 satisfy the condition.

2. List of 3-stars found:
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, N/A)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>

3. Count of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the answer is [4].
