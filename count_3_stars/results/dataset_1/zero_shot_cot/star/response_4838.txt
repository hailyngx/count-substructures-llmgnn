Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

- Node 0: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms 1 star <1, (2, 9)>.
- Node 2: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Forms 3 stars <3, (4, 5, 9)> and <3, (4, 8, 9)> and <3, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 4: Forms 1 star <4, (5, 7)>.
- Node 5: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 6: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 7: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 8: Doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 9: Doesn't form a 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>.
