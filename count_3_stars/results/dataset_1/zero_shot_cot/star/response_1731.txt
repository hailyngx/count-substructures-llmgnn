Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to three other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each node identified:
   - Node 2 contributes 1 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
   - Node 4 contributes 1 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   - Node 7 contributes 1 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 8)>
   - Node 9 contributes 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 7)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
