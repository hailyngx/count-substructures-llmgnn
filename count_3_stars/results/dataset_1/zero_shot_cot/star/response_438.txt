Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The 3-star graphs can have the following structures:
- Center connected to (a, b, c)
- Center connected to (a, b, d)
- Center connected to (a, c, d)
- Center connected to (b, c, d)

Let's count the number of each type of 3-star graph:

- Number of 3-stars with structure (0, 2, 8): 1
- Number of 3-stars with structure (0, 8, 2): 1
- Number of 3-stars with structure (1, 3, 7): 1
- Number of 3-stars with structure (5, 7, 9): 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-star structures are: 
<0, (2, 8, -)>, <1, (3, 7, -)>, <5, (7, 9, -)>.
