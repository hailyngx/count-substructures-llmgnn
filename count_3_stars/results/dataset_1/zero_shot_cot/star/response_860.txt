Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
