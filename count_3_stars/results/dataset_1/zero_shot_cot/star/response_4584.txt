Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, -)>
<5, (4, 9, -)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
