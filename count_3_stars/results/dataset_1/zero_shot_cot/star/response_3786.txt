Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined by finding the central nodes with exactly three neighboring nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. Potential 3-star centered at node 0:
   - Neighbors of node 0: 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 8 => <0, (1, 2, 7)>
   
2. Potential 3-star centered at node 1:
   - Neighbors of node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6 => <1, (0, 3, 5)>

3. Potential 3-star centered at node 2:
   - Neighbors of node 2: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7 => <2, (0, 3, 6)>

4. Potential 3-star centered at node 8:
   - Neighbors of node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 => <8, (0, 1, 4)>
   
So, there are four 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
