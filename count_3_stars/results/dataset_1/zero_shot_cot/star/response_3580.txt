Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. The nodes with degree 3 are nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7.

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each potential center node:
- Node 1 can form 4 different 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 1 different 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 different 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 4 different 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
