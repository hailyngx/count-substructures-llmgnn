Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go step-by-step: 

1. Identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

2. For each node, determine the nodes it is connected to:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

3. Identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 
[7]
