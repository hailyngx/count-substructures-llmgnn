Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8

Step 2: Form possible 3-stars with the identified nodes
    - Possible 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>
    - Possible 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>
