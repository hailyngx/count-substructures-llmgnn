Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 edges (0, 1) and (0, 2).
- Node 1 has 3 edges (1, 0), (1, 4), and (1, 9).
- Node 2 has 3 edges (2, 0), (2, 4), and (2, 6).
- Node 4 has 3 edges (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 7).
- Node 6 has 3 edges (6, 2), (6, 8), and (6, 9).
- Node 8 has 2 edges (8, 5) and (8, 6).
- Node 9 has 2 edges (9, 1) and (9, 6).

2. Recognize the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, -)> 
- <1, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, -)>
- <9, (1, 6, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
