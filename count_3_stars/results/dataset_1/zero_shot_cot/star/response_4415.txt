Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes with edges. Let's go step-by-step to determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Start with each node in the graph and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, form a 3-star with the current node as the center. 
2. List all unique 3-stars found. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
