Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8.
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8.
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6.
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 5.
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.  
[4]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (8, 9, 5)>
