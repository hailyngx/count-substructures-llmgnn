Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 4, 7, 9
   <2, (4, 7, 9)>

2. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 2, 3, 5
   <4, (2, 3, 5)>

3. Central node: 9
   Leaves: 1, 4, 5
   <9, (1, 4, 5)>
