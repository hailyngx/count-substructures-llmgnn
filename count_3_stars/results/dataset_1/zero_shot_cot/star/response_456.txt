Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify all the possible 3-stars by finding all nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 
Given the information provided, we have the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, _)>  (This one only has two connected nodes; the other missing connecting node is unknown)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
