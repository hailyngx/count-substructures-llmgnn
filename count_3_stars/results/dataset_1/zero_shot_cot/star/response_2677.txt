Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3). Then, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Central nodes (degree = 3): 0, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
For each central node, we will consider the unique 3-stars:

For central node 0:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>

For central node 2:
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (6, 4, 8)>

For central node 4:
- <4, (6, 7, 0)>
- <4, (7, 1, 0)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (3, 0, 2)>
- <8, (5, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
