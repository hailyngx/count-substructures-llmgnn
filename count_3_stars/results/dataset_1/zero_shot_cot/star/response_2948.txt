Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is the center:
    - <0, (4, 6, 8)>

2. Node 4 is the center:
    - <4, (0, 2, 8)>

3. Node 8 is the center:
    - <8, (4, 5, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3]
