Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph <center, leaves>:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 2, 4)>

Since the 3-stars are unique, we don't need to list them more than once.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [2]
