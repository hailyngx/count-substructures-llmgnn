Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (1, 5, 7)
- Node 1: (0, 4, 7), (0, 5, 7), (0, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (4, 5, 7), (4, 7, 8), (5, 7, 2)
- Node 3: (8, 3, 9)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 7)
- Node 5: (0, 2, 7)
- Node 6: (7, 0, 9)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 8), (2, 4, 8), (3, 7, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 8), (2, 4, 8), (3, 8, 9)
- Node 9: (3, 7, 9)

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 2)>, <3, (8, 3, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (7, 0, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 9)>
