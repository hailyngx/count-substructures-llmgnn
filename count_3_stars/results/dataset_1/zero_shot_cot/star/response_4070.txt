Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
