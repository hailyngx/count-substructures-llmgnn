Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 7: <5, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
