Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (6, 7, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (3, 5, 2)>
<2, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (8, 3, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 5)>
<5, (7, 6, 5)>
<5, (9, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 7, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 6)>
<7, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 2, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
