Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars. 

Let's go step-by-step to identify the 3-stars:
1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each such node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Here are the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 8, 1)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 7)>
<5, (2, 8, 0)>
<7, (3, 8, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>

Count the number of unique 3-stars: 7
