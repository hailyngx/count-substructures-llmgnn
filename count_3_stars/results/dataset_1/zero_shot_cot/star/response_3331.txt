Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 7)
2. Node 2: (2, 0, 7)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 6), (3, 6, 9)
4. Node 4: (4, 0, 6)
5. Node 6: (6, 3, 4), (6, 4, 8), (6, 8, 9)
6. Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 1, 2)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
