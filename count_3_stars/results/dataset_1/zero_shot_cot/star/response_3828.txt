Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them since those nodes have the potential to be the centers of 3-star graphs. Based on the given edges, the nodes that meet this criteria are: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9.

Next, let's check for each of these nodes if they are the center of a 3-star graph. We will look for nodes connected to them by edges which are not directly connected to each other.

- For node 0:
  - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
  - Among these, node 4, 7, and 8 are not directly connected to each other. So, <0, (4, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.
  
- For node 1:
  - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
  - There are no nodes among 2, 3, and 9 that are not directly connected to each other, so node 1 does not form a 3-star.

- For node 4:
  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
  - Among these, node 8 and 9 are not directly connected to each other. So, <4, (8, 9)> is a 3-star.

- For node 7:
  - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
  - Among these, node 6 and 8 are not directly connected to each other. So, <7, (6, 8)> is a 3-star.

- For node 8:
  - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
  - Among these, node 4, 7, and 9 are not directly connected to each other. So, <8, (4, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.

- For node 9:
  - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
  - Among these, node 6 and 8 are not directly connected to each other. So, <9, (6, 8)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8)>, and <8, (4, 7, 9)>.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have found 4 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [4].
