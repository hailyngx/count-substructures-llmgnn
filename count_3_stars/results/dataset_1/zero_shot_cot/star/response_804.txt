Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its neighbors for each potential 3-star in the graph. 
- Node 0: (1, 4, 7)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 4)
- Node 2: (3, 4, 8)
- Node 3: (1, 2)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 2)
- Node 5: (7)
- Node 6: (8, 9)
- Node 7: (0, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (2, 6, 7)
- Node 9: (6, 7)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
