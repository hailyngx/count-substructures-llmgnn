Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Look for nodes with exactly 3 adjacent nodes (degree = 3). 

Nodes with degree = 3:
- Node 0 (adjacent to nodes 2, 4, 5)
- Node 1 (adjacent to nodes 4, 5, 8)

Step 2: For each node found in Step 1, check if there are connections between its adjacent nodes to form 3-stars.

From the given edges, there are no connections between nodes adjacent to nodes 0 and 1 that form a 3-star.

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

[0]

Therefore, the final answer is: [1]
