Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the provided edges, we can see that nodes {1, 4, 5, 6, and 8} have enough connections to possibly form 3-stars.
2. Let's identify the 3-stars with the center node as one of these candidate nodes:
    - For node 1, the 3-stars are <1, (4, 5, 6)> and <1, (5, 6, 8)>.
    - For node 4, the 3-star is <4, (1, 6, 8)>.
    - For node 5, the 3-star is <5, (1, 6, 8)>.
    - For node 6, the 3-star is <6, (1, 4, 5)>.
    - For node 8, the 3-star is <8, (1, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
