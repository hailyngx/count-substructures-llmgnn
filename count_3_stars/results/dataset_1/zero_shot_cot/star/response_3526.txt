Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, where there are 10 nodes and 24 edges, we follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star configuration with its connected nodes.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:

- Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 8)
- Node 7 has 5 edges: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 edges: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Now, we check each potential center node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Center at node 6:
   <6, (1, 5, 8)> <6, (1, 8, 5)> <6, (5, 1, 8)> <6, (5, 8, 1)> <6, (8, 1, 5)> <6, (8, 5, 1)>

2. Center at node 7:
   <7, (0, 3, 9)> <7, (0, 9, 3)> <7, (3, 0, 9)> <7, (3, 9, 0)> <7, (9, 0, 3)> <7, (9, 3, 0)>

3. Center at node 9:
   <9, (0, 1, 7)> <9, (0, 7, 1)> <9, (1, 0, 7)> <9, (1, 7, 0)> <9, (7, 0, 1)> <9, (7, 1, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
