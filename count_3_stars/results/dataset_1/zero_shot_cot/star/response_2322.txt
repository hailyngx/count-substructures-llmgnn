Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars in the graph, we find a total of [6] 3-stars.
