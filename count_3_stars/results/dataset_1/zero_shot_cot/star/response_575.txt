Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, we need to identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 3}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 3}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {6, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 1, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 3)>
- <2, (1, 9, 4)>
- <3, (0, 9, 4)>
- <4, (2, 1, 3)>
- <8, (6, 9, 2)>
- <9, (3, 8, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
