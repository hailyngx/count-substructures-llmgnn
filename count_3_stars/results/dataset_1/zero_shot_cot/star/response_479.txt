Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, -)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, -)>
<7, (5, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (3, -, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
