Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for every node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (4, 5, 8)>
3. <5, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
5. <7, (2, 5, 6)>
6. <8, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <9, (5, 8, -)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
