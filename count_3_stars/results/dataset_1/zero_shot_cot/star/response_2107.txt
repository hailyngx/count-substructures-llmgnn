Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7 have exactly three edges each connected to them. 

Next, we need to check the neighbors of each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars. 
Let's start with node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7. These connections form two 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 7)> and <2, (5, 1, 7)>.

Moving to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6. These connections form two 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 3)> and <4, (1, 0, 3)>.

Next, node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. However, these connections do not form a 3-star as node 2 is already part of another star.

Lastly, node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 5, but as mentioned earlier, node 2 is already part of another 3-star. Hence, there are no additional 3-stars centered at node 7.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (1, 0, 3)>

Count of 3-stars:
