Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 7, 4)>
- <2, (1, 9, -)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, -)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. So, the final answer is [10].
