Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the graph based on the provided edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3, creating a 3-star with 0 as the center and 1, 2, 3 as leaves.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3, creating a 3-star with 1 as the center and 0, 2, 3 as leaves.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3, creating a 3-star with 2 as the center and 0, 1, 3 as leaves.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2, creating a 3-star with 3 as the center and 0, 1, 2 as leaves.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3, creating a 3-star with 6 as the center and 1, 2, 3 as leaves.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6, creating a 3-star with 8 as the center and 2, 3, 6 as leaves.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8, creating a 3-star with 9 as the center and 2, 7, 8 as leaves.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
