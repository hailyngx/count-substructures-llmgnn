Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes connected to each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 node
- Node 1: 4 nodes
- Node 2: 3 nodes
- Node 3: 4 nodes
- Node 4: 3 nodes
- Node 5: 5 nodes
- Node 6: 5 nodes
- Node 7: 4 nodes
- Node 8: 5 nodes
- Node 9: 2 nodes

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6. <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9. <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
