Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: (2, 4, 8)
- Node 1: (5, 6, 7)
- Node 3: (6, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (7, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (1, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 3, 9)
- Node 7: (1, 3, 4)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 5)
- Node 9: (3, 4, 5)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
