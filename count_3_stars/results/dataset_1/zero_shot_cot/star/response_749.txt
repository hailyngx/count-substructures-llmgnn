Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes with three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

From the given edges:
- Node 1 has edges (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), and (1, 9) connected to it.
- Node 3 has edges (3, 1), (3, 5), and (3, 6) connected to it.
- Node 4 has edges (4, 1), (4, 7), and (4, 9) connected to it.
- Node 5 has edges (5, 1), (5, 3), and (5, 8) connected to it.
- Node 7 has edges (7, 0), (7, 4), and (7, 8) connected to it.

Now, let's find the 3-stars formed by each of these nodes as the center. 

Therefore, the 3-stars formed in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>

Since all 3-stars are unique, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
