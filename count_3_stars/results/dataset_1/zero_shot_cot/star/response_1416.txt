Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0: (0, 2, 6), (0, 6, 9), (0, 2, 9) 
2. Node 2: (2, 0, 8) 
3. Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 1, 7), (6, 0, 3)
4. Node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 4, 5), (9, 0, 8)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>
