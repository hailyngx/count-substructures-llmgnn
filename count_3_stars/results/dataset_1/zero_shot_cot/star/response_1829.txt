Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
   - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <0, (2, 3, 8)>
   - <0, (2, 3, 9)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 7)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
   - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <2, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <2, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (3, 4, 7)>
   - <2, (3, 4, 8)>
   - <2, (3, 4, 9)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <2, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <2, (3, 8, 9)>

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9.
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <3, (2, 7, 9)>

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
   - <4, (1, 2, 9)>

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
   - <5, (2, 8, 9)>

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
