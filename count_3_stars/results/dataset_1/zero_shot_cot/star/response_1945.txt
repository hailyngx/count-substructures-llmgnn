Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences in which a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given list of edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 9) => <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9) => <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9) => <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 8)>
4. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 9) => <7, (0, 2, 6)>
5. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8) => <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>.
