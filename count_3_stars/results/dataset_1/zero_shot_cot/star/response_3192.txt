Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

1. Central node 1:
   - Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 8
   - Possible 3-star combinations: 
     - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
     - <1, (0, 2, 8)>
     - <1, (2, 3, 8)>

2. Central node 2:
   - Leaves: 1, 3, 6, 7
   - Possible 3-star combinations: 
     - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
     - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
     - <2, (3, 6, 7)>

3. Central node 3:
   - Leaves: 1, 2, 6
   - Possible 3-star combination: 
     - <3, (1, 2, 6)>

4. Central node 6:
   - Leaves: 2, 3, 8, 9
   - Possible 3-star combinations: 
     - <6, (2, 3, 8)>
     - <6, (2, 3, 9)>
     - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
     - <6, (3, 8, 9)>

5. Central node 7:
   - Leaves: 2, 8, 9
   - Possible 3-star combination: 
     - <7, (2, 8, 9)>

6. Central node 9:
   - Leaves: 6, 7
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 9 as the central node.

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>]  
[<12>]
