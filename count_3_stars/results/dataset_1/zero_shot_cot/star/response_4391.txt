Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, -)>
<9, (0, 2, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, the answer is [8].
