Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (a 3-star). 

First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:
- From node 0: (0, 2, 7)
- From node 1: (1, 5, 9)
- From node 2: (2, 0, 4) and (2, 5, 7)
- From node 4: (4, 2, 7) and (4, 3, 9)
- From node 5: (5, 1, 2) and (5, 6, 9)
- From node 7: (7, 0, 4) and (7, 4, 8)
- From node 9: (9, 1, 4)

Next, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:  
[7]  

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7)>  
<1, (5, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4)>  
<2, (5, 7)>  
<4, (2, 7)>  
<4, (3, 9)>  
<5, (1, 2)>  
<5, (6, 9)>  
<7, (0, 4)>  
<7, (4, 8)>  
<9, (1, 4)>
