Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-star structures. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8].
