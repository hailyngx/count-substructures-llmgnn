Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected edges:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 2)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 1)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 1)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 6, 2)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (2, 6, 1)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 0, 1)>
<8, (6, 1, 2)>
<8, (6, 1, 9)>
<8, (6, 2, 3)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 4, 0)>
<8, (6, 4, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].
