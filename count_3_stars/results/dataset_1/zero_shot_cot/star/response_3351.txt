Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star structure.

Given the edges provided, the 3-stars in the graph are:

<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (2, 9, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
