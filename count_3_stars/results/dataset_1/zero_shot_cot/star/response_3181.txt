Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. To form a 3-star, a node needs to be connected to three other nodes. Let's list them down:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- There are three 3-stars around node 0: <0, (3, 9, 9)>, <0, (9, 3, 9)>, <0, (9, 9, 3)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 1: <1, (8, 9, 9)>, <1, (9, 8, 9)>, <1, (9, 9, 8)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 3: <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 0, 9)>, <3, (9, 0, 7)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 4: <4, (5, 6, 6)>, <4, (6, 5, 6)>, <4, (6, 6, 5)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 5: <5, (4, 7, 7)>, <5, (7, 4, 7)>, <5, (7, 7, 4)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 6: <6, (2, 4, 4)>, <6, (4, 2, 4)>, <6, (4, 4, 2)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 7: <7, (3, 5, 5)>, <7, (5, 3, 5)>, <7, (5, 5, 3)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 8: <8, (1, 9, 9)>, <8, (9, 1, 9)>, <8, (9, 9, 1)>.
- There are three 3-stars around node 9: <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (1, 0, 8)>, <9, (8, 0, 1)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].
