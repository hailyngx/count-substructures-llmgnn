Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes and their adjacent nodes in the graph based on the given edge information.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

We have the following 3-star configurations:
- <0, (7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 3, 8)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (2, 0, 4)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 0, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (4, 1, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
