Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the central node in each 3-star. The central node will have exactly three neighbors connected by edges.
2. List out the nodes connected to each central node to form a 3-star.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, here are the 3-stars found:
- Central node 0: <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- Central node 1: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Central node 2: <2, (0, 7, -)>
- Central node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Central node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- Central node 7: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- Central node 8: <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
