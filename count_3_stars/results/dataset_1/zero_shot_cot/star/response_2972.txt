Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star configuration. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (3, 7, -)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 5, 6)>
6. <5, (1, 4, -)>
7. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 4)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
