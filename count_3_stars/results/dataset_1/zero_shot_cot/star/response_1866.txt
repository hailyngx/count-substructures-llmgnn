Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by locating central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed with node 0 since it is not connected to three other nodes.

2. Node 1: Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7. <1, (0, 6, 7)>

3. Node 2: Node 2 is connected only to node 9. No 3-stars can be formed with node 2 since it is not connected to three other nodes.

4. Node 3: Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9. <3, (0, 4, 9)>

5. Node 4: Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9. <4, (3, 8, 9)>

6. Node 5: Node 5 is connected only to node 7. No 3-stars can be formed with node 5 since it is not connected to three other nodes.

7. Node 6: Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9. No 3-stars can be formed with node 6 since it is not connected to three other nodes.

8. Node 7: Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. No 3-stars can be formed with node 7 since it is not connected to three other nodes.

9. Node 8: Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9. <8, (1, 4, 9)>

10. Node 9: Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8. It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8. <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
