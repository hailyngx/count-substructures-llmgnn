Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes to find the 3-stars in the graph. The central node will have degree 3.

Central Node: 3
Adjacent Nodes: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

1. (3, 4, 7) 
2. (3, 5, 3) 
3. (3, 5, 6) 
4. (3, 5, 9) 
5. (3, 6, 2) 
6. (3, 6, 7) 
7. (3, 6, 9) 
8. (3, 7, 1) 
9. (3, 7, 2) 
10. (3, 7, 4) 
11. (3, 7, 6) 
12. (3, 7, 9) 
13. (3, 8, 3) 
14. (3, 8, 4) 
15. (3, 8, 9) 
16. (3, 9, 3) 
17. (3, 9, 6) 
18. (3, 9, 7) 
19. (3, 9, 8) 

Therefore, there are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
