Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). 

Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6: <0, (1, 6)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9: <2, (3, 5, 9)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 6: <3, (2, 6)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 8, and 9: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (8, 9, 0)>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9: <8, (4, 6, 9)>
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8: <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
