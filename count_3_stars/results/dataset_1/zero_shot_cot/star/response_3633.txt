Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of the star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <0, (2, 1, 5)>
4. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
5. <0, (5, 1, 2)>
6. <0, (6, 1, 4)>
7. <3, (4, 6, 8)>
8. <3, (6, 4, 8)>
9. <3, (8, 4, 6)>
10. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
11. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
12. <6, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
