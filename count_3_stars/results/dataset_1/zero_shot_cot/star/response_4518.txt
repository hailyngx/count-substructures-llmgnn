Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we get: [7].
