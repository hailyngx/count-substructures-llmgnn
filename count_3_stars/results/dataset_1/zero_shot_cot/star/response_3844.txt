Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (9, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
