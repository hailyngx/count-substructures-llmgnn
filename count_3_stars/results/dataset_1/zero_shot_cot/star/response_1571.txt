Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes with the number of edges connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1 edge
- Node 1: 5 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 4 edges
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 2 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 1 edge
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 9: 4 edges

Next, we find the nodes that form 3-stars by serving as centers with exactly three connected nodes:
- From the node information given, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 have the potential to be the centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1, we have two 3-stars: 
    - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- For node 2, we have one 3-star: 
    - <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- For node 3, we have one 3-star: 
    - <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- For node 6, we have one 3-star: 
    - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- For node 8, we have two 3-stars:
    - <8, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- For node 9, we have one 3-star: 
    - <9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
