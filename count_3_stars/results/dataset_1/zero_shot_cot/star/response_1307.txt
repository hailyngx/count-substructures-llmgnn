Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's start by looking for all the 3-stars in the graph:

We can see that node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, and 9. So, <0, (2, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.
Similarly, <1, (3, 4, 8)> is another 3-star.
<5, (4, 6, 7)> is another 3-star.
<8, (3, 4, 5)> is another 3-star.
Lastly, <9, (0, 7, 9)> is the final 3-star that can be found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Answer: [5]
