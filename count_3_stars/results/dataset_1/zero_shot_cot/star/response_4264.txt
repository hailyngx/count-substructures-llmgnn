Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: No 3-star as it is only connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 2: No 3-star as it is only connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 6)> and <4, (9, 5, 6)>
- Node 5: No 3-star as it is only connected to node 4.
- Node 6: No 3-star as it is only connected to node 4.
- Node 7: No 3-star as it is only connected to node 8.
- Node 8: <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: No 3-star as it is only connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<1, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>
