Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it in each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 6, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 3, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 2, 6)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 2)
- Node 5: No 3-star configuration
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1)
- Node 7: No 3-star configuration
- Node 8: (8, 0, 2)
- Node 9: No 3-star configuration

Therefore, the unique 3-stars identified in the graph are:

<0, (6, 8)>  
<1, (4, 6)>  
<2, (3, 4)>  
<3, (2, 6)>  
<8, (0, 2)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
