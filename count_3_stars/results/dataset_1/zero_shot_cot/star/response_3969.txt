Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 9, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 9, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
