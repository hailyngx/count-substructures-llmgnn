Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from node 0:
    - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
  
2. Moving to node 1:
    - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
  
3. Going to node 2:
    - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    
4. Proceeding to node 3:
    - <3, (2, 7, 9)>
  
5. Moving to node 4:
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
  
6. Going to node 5:
    - <5, (7, 8, 9)>
  
7. Proceeding to node 6:
    - <6, (0, 1, 9)>
  
8. Moving to node 7:
    - <7, (3, 4, 5)>
  
9. Going to node 8:
    - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
  
10. Proceeding to node 9:
    - <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The final answer is [10].
