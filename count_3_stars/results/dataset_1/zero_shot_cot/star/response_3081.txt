Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - Connected to nodes 6, 7
    - <0, (6, 7)>

2. Node 1:
    - Connected to nodes 5, 7
    - <1, (5, 7)>

3. Node 3:
    - Connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9
    - <3, (4, 6, 7)> and <3, (6, 4, 7)> and <3, (9, 4, 6)> and <3, (9, 6, 7)> 

4. Node 4:
    - Connected to nodes 3, 6, 8
    - <4, (3, 6, 8)>

5. Node 5:
    - Connected to nodes 1, 8
    - <5, (1, 8)>

6. Node 6:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4
    - <6, (0, 3, 4)>

7. Node 7:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3
    - <7, (0, 1, 3)>

8. Node 8:
    - Connected to nodes 4, 5
    - <8, (4, 5)>

9. Node 9:
    - Connected to node 3
    - No 3-stars from node 9 as it has only one connection.

Counting unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (6, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 4, 7)>
- <3, (9, 4, 6)>
- <3, (9, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
