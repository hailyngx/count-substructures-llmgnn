Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9. Node 0 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 4, and 5), forming a 3-star with Node 0 as the center. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8. Node 1 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 3, 6), forming a 3-star with Node 1 as the center. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6. Node 3 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 4, 6), forming a 3-star with Node 3 as the center. <3, (1, 4, 6)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7. Node 4 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 3, 6), forming a 3-star with Node 4 as the center. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 9. Node 6 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 4, 7), forming a 3-star with Node 6 as the center. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9. Node 8 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 5, 7), forming a 3-star with Node 8 as the center. <8, (1, 5, 7)>
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8. Node 9 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 2, 6), forming a 3-star with Node 9 as the center. <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
