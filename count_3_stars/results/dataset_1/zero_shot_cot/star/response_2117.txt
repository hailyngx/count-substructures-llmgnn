Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find them step by step.

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 1: (2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (0, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 5: (0, 4, 7)
- Node 8: (1, 4)

2. Based on the above information, the 3-stars in the graph can be summarized as follows:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
