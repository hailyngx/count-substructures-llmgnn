Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list all the 3-stars with their central node and leaf nodes: 

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (5, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars which is 10. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
