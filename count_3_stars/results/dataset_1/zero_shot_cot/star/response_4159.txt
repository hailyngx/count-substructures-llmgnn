Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (8)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us: [9]
