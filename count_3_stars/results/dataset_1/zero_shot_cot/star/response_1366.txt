Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Nodes 0, 1, and 4 form a 3-star: Central node: 0, Leaves: 1, 4, <0, (1, 4)>
- Nodes 1, 2, and 5 form a 3-star: Central node: 1, Leaves: 2, 5, <1, (2, 5)>
- Nodes 3, 7, and 8 form a 3-star: Central node: 3, Leaves: 7, 8, <3, (7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4)>, <1, (2, 5)>, <3, (7, 8)>
