Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

We can notice that a 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: (1, 3, 4)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 4)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 4)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 3)
- Node 6: (0, 2, 3)
- Node 8: (1, 5, 9)
- Node 9: (1, 7, 8)

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
