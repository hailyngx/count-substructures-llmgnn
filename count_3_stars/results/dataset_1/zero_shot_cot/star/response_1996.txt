Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After examining the edges provided, we can see that there are 3-star structures present within the graph. Let's list them:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (6, 7, 4)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
