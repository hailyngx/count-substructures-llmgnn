Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes: 7 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to 2 nodes: 5 and 8
- Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes: 3, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to 1 node: 2
- Node 4 is connected to 1 node: 2
- Node 5 is connected to 5 nodes: 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes: 5 and 7
- Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 2, and 5
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 2, and 5

Counting the number of 3-stars:
- There are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph: 
    <0, (7, 9)>
    <1, (5, 8)>
    <5, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
