Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 6, -)>
2. <2, (1, 3, -)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <4, (9, -,-)>
5. <5, (3, 7, -)>
6. <6, (1, 3, 8)>
7. <7, (5, 8, -)>
8. <8, (6, 7, -)>
9. <9, (4, -,-)>

Thus, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [9]
