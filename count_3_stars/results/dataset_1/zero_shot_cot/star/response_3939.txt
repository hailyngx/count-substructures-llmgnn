Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 9: <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
    
2. Moving to node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   
3. Moving to node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9: <3, (6, 9)>
   
4. Now we have covered all the 3-stars in the graph. 

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, and <2, (5, 6, 8)> inside brackets [].
