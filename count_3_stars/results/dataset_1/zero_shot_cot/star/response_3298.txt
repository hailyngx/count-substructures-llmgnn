Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 7)>
<1, (8, 8, 1)>
<2, (7, 7, 2)>
<3, (6, 6, 3)>
<4, (0, 7, 7)>
<6, (3, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 1, 8)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
