Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes that are connected to a central node by edges. Let's start by identifying the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 connections). Then we can list the unique 3-stars.

Central nodes: 0, 1, 2, 6

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
