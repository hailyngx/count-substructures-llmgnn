Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all potential 3-stars. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we should look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Let's identify the potential central nodes with their connected nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: (2, 3, 7)
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: (3, 7, 9)
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: (0, 4, 6)
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: (0, 1, 5)
- Node 4 is connected to 2 other nodes: (2, 5)
- Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes: (3, 4)
- Node 6 is connected to 1 other node: (2)
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes: (0, 1, 9)
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes: (2, 3)
- Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes: (1, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]
