Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can find the following 3-star configurations:

1. Center node: 2, Leaves: 6, 7, 9 
2. Center node: 7, Leaves: 1, 2, 4 
3. Center node: 9, Leaves: 0, 2, 7

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
