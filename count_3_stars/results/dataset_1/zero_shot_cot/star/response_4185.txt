Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Now we can identify the 3-star patterns present in the graph:

<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
