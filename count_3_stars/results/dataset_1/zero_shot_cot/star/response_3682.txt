Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Determine the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (leaves).
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
To create a 3-star, we need a central node and exactly 3 leaves connected to it.
Let's count the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: 9
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
