Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
At first glance, we can see that node 5 is connected to three other nodes: 2, 4, and 6; forming a 3-star around node 5. Similarly, node 1 also forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6. 

Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
