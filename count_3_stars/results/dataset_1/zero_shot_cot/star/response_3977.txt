Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph to find these 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is the center of <0, (1, 2, X)> where X can be any one of 1 or 2.
2. Node 3 is the center of <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
3. Node 5 is the center of <5, (3, 7, 8)>.
4. Node 8 is the center of <8, (3, 5, X)> where X can be any one of 3 or 5.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, X)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, X)>.
