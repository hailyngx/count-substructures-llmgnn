Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8, forming the 3-star <0, (1, 3, 8)>.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6, forming the 3-star <3, (0, 4, 6)>.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9, forming the 3-star <4, (3, 6, 9)>.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7, forming the 3-star <6, (3, 4, 7)>.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9, forming the 3-star <7, (6, 8, 9)>.
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7, forming the 3-star <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
