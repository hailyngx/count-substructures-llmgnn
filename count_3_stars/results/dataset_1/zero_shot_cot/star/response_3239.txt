Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
