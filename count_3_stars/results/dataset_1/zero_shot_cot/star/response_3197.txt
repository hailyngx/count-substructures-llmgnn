Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
  
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7.
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
  
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- <2, (0, 5, 9)>
  
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
  
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>

From the above combinations, we have found 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
