Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    - Node 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9 have exactly three neighbors.

Step 2: For each node with exactly three neighbors, check if they form a 3-star.
    - For node 2: (2, 0, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7, 8)
    - For node 3: (3, 0, 2, 4), (3, 2, 4, 7), (3, 4, 6, 7), (3, 4, 7, 9)
    - For node 4: (4, 1, 2, 3), (4, 2, 3, 7), (4, 3, 5, 7), (4, 3, 7, 9)
    - For node 7: (7, 0, 2, 3), (7, 2, 3, 4), (7, 3, 4, 6)
    - For node 9: (9, 3, 4, 5)

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.
    - Total 3-stars: 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 3, 4)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>
