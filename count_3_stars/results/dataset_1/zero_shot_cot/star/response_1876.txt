Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes in the graph:

- Central Node 0: Adjacent Nodes 3, 8, 9
- Central Node 1: Adjacent Nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Central Node 2: Adjacent Nodes 6, 7, 8
- Central Node 3: Adjacent Nodes 0, 1, 5, 6
- Central Node 4: Adjacent Node 1
- Central Node 5: Adjacent Nodes 3, 7, 9
- Central Node 6: Adjacent Nodes 2, 3
- Central Node 7: Adjacent Nodes 1, 2, 5, 8
- Central Node 8: Adjacent Nodes 0, 1, 2, 7
- Central Node 9: Adjacent Nodes 0, 1, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Central Node 0: <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- Central Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Central Node 2: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 adjacent nodes
- Central Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 1, 8)>
- Central Node 4: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 adjacent nodes
- Central Node 5: <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- Central Node 6: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 adjacent nodes
- Central Node 7: <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Central Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- Central Node 9: No 3-stars as it does not have 3 adjacent nodes

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 1, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, and <8, (0, 1, 7)>.
