Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
