Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star:
    - Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
    - Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 3, and 9.
    - Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9.
    - Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
    - Node 9 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.

2. Enumerate the 3-stars using the central nodes and their connected nodes:
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <4, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 8)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
