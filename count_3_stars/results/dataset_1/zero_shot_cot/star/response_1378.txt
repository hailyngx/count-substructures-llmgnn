Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: (1, 3, 4)
   <0, (1, 3, 4)>

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: (0, 2, 5)
   <1, (0, 2, 5)>

3. Central node: 2
   Leaves: (1, 3, 7)
   <2, (1, 3, 7)>

4. Central node: 3
   Leaves: (0, 2, 6)
   <3, (0, 2, 6)>

5. Central node: 4
   Leaves: (0, 5, 6)
   <4, (0, 5, 6)>

6. Central node: 5
   Leaves: (1, 4, 8)
   <5, (1, 4, 8)>

7. Central node: 6
   Leaves: (1, 3, 8)
   <6, (1, 3, 8)>

8. Central node: 7
   Leaves: (0, 2, 5)
   <7, (0, 2, 5)>

9. Central node: 8
   Leaves: (2, 5, 6)
   <8, (2, 5, 6)>

10. Central node: 9
    No 3-star with a central node of 9.

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
