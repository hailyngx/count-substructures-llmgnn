Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 5, 8)
2. Central node 1: (1, 5, 3)
3. Central node 2: (2, 4, 7)
4. Central node 3: (3, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)
5. Central node 4: (4, 2, 5), (4, 5, 8)
6. Central node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 3, 4)
7. Central node 6: (6, 3, 9)
8. Central node 7: (7, 2, 4)
9. Central node 8: (8, 0, 3), (8, 4, 5)
10. Central node 9: (9, 3, 6)

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [10]
