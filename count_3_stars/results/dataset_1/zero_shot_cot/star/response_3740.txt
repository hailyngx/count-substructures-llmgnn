Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information, let's first identify the nodes with their respective connections:

Node 0: 7, 8
Node 1: 2, 8
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 7, 9
Node 5: 3, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 1, 5
Node 9: 4

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to locate the central node and its three connected nodes. 
Let's identify the 3-stars: 

<0, (7, 8, -)>
<1, (2, 8, -)>
<2, (1, - ,-)>
<3, (5, - ,-)>
<4, (7, 9, -)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, - ,-)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (7, 8, -)> <1, (2, 8, -)> <2, (1, - ,-)> <3, (5, - ,-)> <4, (7, 9, -)> <5, (3, 7, 8)> <7, (0, 4, 5)> <8, (0, 1, 5)> <9, (4, - ,-)>
