Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-star structures in this graph. 
Here they are listed below:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
