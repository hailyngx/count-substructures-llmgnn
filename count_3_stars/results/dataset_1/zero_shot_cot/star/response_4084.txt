Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 1 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 5 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it.

Next, we look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. Nodes 2, 6, and 8 meet this criterion. Let's find the 3-stars centered at these nodes:

1. Node 2: (2, 0, 4, 9)
2. Node 6: (6, 3, 4, 5)
3. Node 8: (8, 0, 1, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, and <8, (0, 1, 7)>.
