Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1:
Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 1, 4, and 5. (3-star with center at node 6)
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 6. (3-star with center at node 8)

### Step 2:
List all unique 3-stars found:
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>

### Finally:
