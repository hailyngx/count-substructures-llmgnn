Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The potential central nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's analyze each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to: 2, 4
   - 3-star: <0, (2, 4)>

2. Node 2:
   - Connected to: 0, 3
   - 3-star: <2, (0, 3)>

3. Node 3:
   - Connected to: 2, 7, 8, 9
   - 3-stars: <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>

4. Node 4:
   - Connected to: 0, 5, 8, 9
   - 3-stars: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>

5. Node 5:
   - Connected to: 4
   - No 3-stars as it's not connected to 3 nodes.

6. Node 6:
   - Connected to: 7, 8
   - No 3-stars as it's not connected to 3 nodes.

7. Node 7:
   - Connected to: 3, 6, 8
   - No additional 3-star from node 7 as it is already covered in previous calculations.

8. Node 8:
   - Connected to: 3, 4, 6, 7
   - No additional 3-stars from node 8 as they are already covered.

9. Node 9:
   - Connected to: 3, 4
   - No 3-stars as it's not connected to 3 nodes.

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4)>, <2, (0, 3)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>.
