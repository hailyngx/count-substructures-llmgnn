Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 7, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 6, 7)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 3, 4), (2, 7, 8)
4. Node 6: (6, 1, 7), (6, 8, 7)
5. Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 2, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
