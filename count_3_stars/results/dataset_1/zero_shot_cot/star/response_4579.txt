Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- 3-star with node 0 as the center: (0, 7, 9)
- 3-star with node 2 as the center: (2, 4, 9)
- 3-star with node 4 as the center: (4, 1, 2), (4, 3, 7)
- 3-star with node 9 as the center: (9, 0, 2), (9, 5, 6)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 9)>
<2, (4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2)>, <4, (3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2)>, <9, (5, 6)>
