Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the node degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 can form 3-stars with nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 can form 3-stars with nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 9 can form 3-stars with nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Hence, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
