Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can be the centers of potential 3-stars.
   
   Potential center nodes: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
   
2. For each potential center node, identify if the connected nodes form a 3-star pattern (center node connected to exactly three other nodes). 

   - For center node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 5, 9) are 3-stars.
   - For center node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 9, 0) are 3-stars.
   - For center node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 7, 1) are 3-stars.
   - For center node 5: (5, 0, 9), (5, 7, 9) are 3-stars.
   - For center node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 5, 7) are 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (1, 7, 0)>, <5, (9, 7, 0)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
