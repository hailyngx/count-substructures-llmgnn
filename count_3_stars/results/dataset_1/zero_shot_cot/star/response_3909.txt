Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. Then we can find the 3-stars in the graph.  

The nodes and their adjacent nodes are as follows:  
Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9  
Node 2: 4, 9  
Node 3: 1  
Node 4: 2, 6  
Node 5: 0, 1  
Node 6: 0, 4  
Node 7: 1, 8  
Node 8: 0, 1, 7  
Node 9: 0, 1, 2  

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.  

[<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 9)>]  

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
