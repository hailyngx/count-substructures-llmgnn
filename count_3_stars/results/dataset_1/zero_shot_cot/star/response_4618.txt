Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 2, 5, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 2: (0, 1, 5), (0, 3, 5), (1, 3, 4), (1, 5, 7), (3, 2, 4), (5, 2, 7), (5, 2, 9), (9, 2, 5)
2. For Node 5: (1, 2, 7), (1, 2, 9), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 5), (2, 3, 5), (2, 5, 7), (2, 5, 9), (3, 2, 5), (5, 1, 7), (5, 7, 9), (9, 2, 5), (9, 5, 8)
3. For Node 9: (2, 5, 8), (5, 1, 7), (5, 2, 9), (5, 7, 9)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 1)>, <5, (1, 7, 2)>, <5, (2, 7, 5)>, <5, (2, 9, 5)>, <9, (2, 8, 5)>
