Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 3, 7)>
7. <9, (1, 2, 8)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
