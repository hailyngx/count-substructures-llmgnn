Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- For node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- For node 2: <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- For node 3: <3, (2, 5, _)> (Node 3 has only two edges, hence it cannot form a 3-star)
- For node 5: <5, (3, _, _)> (Node 5 has only one edge, hence it cannot form a 3-star)
- For node 6: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- For node 7: <7, (0, 1, _)>
- For node 9: <9, (2, 6, _)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
