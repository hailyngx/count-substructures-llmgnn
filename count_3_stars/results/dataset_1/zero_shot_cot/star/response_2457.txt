Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph by considering the unique 3-stars above:
