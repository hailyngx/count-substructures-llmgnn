Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for the central nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. Let's go through the list of nodes and their neighboring nodes to identify the 3-stars.

Nodes:
- Node 0: Neighbors [2, 3]
- Node 1: Neighbors [2, 4, 8]
- Node 2: Neighbors [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9]
- Node 3: Neighbors [0, 2, 9]
- Node 4: Neighbors [1, 2, 6]
- Node 5: Neighbor [2]
- Node 6: Neighbor [4]
- Node 7: Neighbor [2]
- Node 8: Neighbors [1, 9]
- Node 9: Neighbors [2, 3, 8]

From the list above, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 9, 2)>
<9, (3, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].  
The unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 9, 2)>, and <9, (3, 8, 2)>.
