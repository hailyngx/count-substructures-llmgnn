Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges in the graph, we can identify the central node and the leaves connected to it:

1. Central Node:  
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9.

2. 3-Star Configurations:
   - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 6, 9)>

Thus, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [4].
