Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
3. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
4. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 7)>
6. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
7. <7, (2, 4, 6)>
8. <6, (3, 7, 9)>
9. <9, (0, 5, 6)>
10. <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
