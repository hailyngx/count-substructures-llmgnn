Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

We will start by identifying nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star pattern. We will then count the number of such unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Examining the provided edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
1. Node 2 as the center with leaves 0, 1, and 3: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
2. Node 3 as the center with leaves 1, 2, and 6: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
3. Node 7 as the center with leaves 0, 5, and 8: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
4. Node 8 as the center with leaves 2, 3, and 7: <8, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
