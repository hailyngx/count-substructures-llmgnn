Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

The central nodes in a 3-star will be the nodes with three edges connected to them. Based on the given edges, the central nodes are 0, 1, 3, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's find the leaves for each central node:
- For central node 0: Leaves are 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- For central node 1: Leaves are 0, 5, and 7.
- For central node 3: Leaves are 0, 4, and 8.
- For central node 8: Leaves are 3, 7, and 9.
- For central node 9: Leaves are 0 and 8.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
