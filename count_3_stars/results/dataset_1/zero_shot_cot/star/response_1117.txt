Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 2 3-stars: <1, (2, 7, 7)> and <1, (7, 2, 7)>.
- Node 2 forms 2 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 7)> and <2, (7, 1, 7)>.
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars: <3, (5, 7, 9)> and <3, (9, 5, 7)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 7)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 7, 7)>.
- Node 6 forms 3 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 0, 6)>, and <6, (7, 7, 8)>.
- Node 7 forms 3 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 1, 9)>, and <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 6, 6)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 7, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 7, 7)>, <1, (7, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 7)>, <2, (7, 1, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (9, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (4, 0, 6)>, <6, (7, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 1, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
