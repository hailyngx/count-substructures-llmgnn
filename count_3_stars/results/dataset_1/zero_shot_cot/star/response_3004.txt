Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as these nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3: 2, 3, 4, 6

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's start with node 2 as the center:

1. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 5)>

Now, let's move on to node 3 as the center:

3. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
5. <3, (4, 5, 7)>

Next, let's consider node 4 as the center:

6. <4, (0, 3, 9)>
7. <4, (2, 3, 9)>
8. <4, (3, 9, 5)>

Finally, let's look at node 6 as the center:

9. <6, (1, 7, 9)>
10. <6, (7, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
