Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list down all the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, -)>
<6, (8, -, -)>
<7, (8, -, -)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, -, -)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above to get the final answer.

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
