Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves connected to the center, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the list of edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, -)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, -)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (4, -,-)>, <7, (0, 2, -)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, -)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 9, -)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (4, -,-)>, <7, (0, 2, -)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>.
