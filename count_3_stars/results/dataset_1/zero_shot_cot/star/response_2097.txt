Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: (1, 3, 5)
2. Node 1: (0, 3, 5), (3, 4, 9)
3. Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star
4. Node 3: (0, 1, 4), (1, 4, 9), (4, 8, 5)
5. Node 4: Not a part of any 3-star
6. Node 5: (0, 1, 7), (1, 7, 6), (7, 6, 7)
7. Node 6: Not a part of any 3-star
8. Node 7: (0, 1, 5), (1, 5, 8)
9. Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star
10. Node 9: (1, 4, 9)

Count of 3-stars = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 6)>.
