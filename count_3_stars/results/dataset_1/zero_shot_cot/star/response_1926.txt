Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graph in the given graph:

- The central node 0 has neighbors 8.
  - 3-star: <0, (8, )]
- The central node 1 has neighbors 3 and 7.
  - 3-star: <1, (3, 7, )]
- The central node 2 has neighbors 5 and 8.
  - 3-star: <2, (5, 8, )]
- The central node 3 has neighbors 1, 6, and 8.
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- The central node 6 has neighbors 3, 8, and 9.
  - 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- The central node 8 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
  - 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
