Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 0:
    - Neighbors: 4, 5, 8
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

2. Node 1:
    - Neighbors: 3, 7, 9
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

3. Node 2:
    - Neighbors: 4, 6
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

4. Node 3:
    - Neighbors: 1
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

5. Node 4:
    - Neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
    - Number of 3-stars: 1

6. Node 5:
    - Neighbors: 0, 4
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

7. Node 6:
    - Neighbors: 2, 4
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

8. Node 7:
    - Neighbors: 1, 4
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

9. Node 8:
    - Neighbors: 0
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

10. Node 9:
    - Neighbors: 1, 4
    - Number of 3-stars: 0

Based on the above analysis, we have found 1 unique 3-star:
<4, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
