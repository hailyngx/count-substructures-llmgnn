Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<9, (7, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, the final answer is: [7].
