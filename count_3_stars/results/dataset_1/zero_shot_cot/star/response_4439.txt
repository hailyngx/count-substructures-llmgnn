Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- As a 3-star requires a central node with exactly three connected nodes, we can first list the nodes with their respective number of connecting edges:
    - Node 0: 2 connecting edges
    - Node 1: 3 connecting edges
    - Node 2: 4 connecting edges
    - Node 3: 5 connecting edges
    - Node 4: 4 connecting edges
    - Node 5: 4 connecting edges
    - Node 6: 1 connecting edge
    - Node 7: 5 connecting edges
    - Node 8: 3 connecting edges
    - Node 9: 2 connecting edges

- Now we can list the 3-stars by looking at the nodes with exactly three connecting edges and their neighbors. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars:
    <1, (2, 8, 6)>
    <2, (0, 1, 5)>
    <3, (4, 5, 7)>

- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
