Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.
    - We can form one 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
    
2. Node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9.
    - We can form one 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    
3. Node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
    - We cannot form any 3-star with node 2 as the center.
    
4. Node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to node 0.
    - We cannot form any 3-star with node 3 as the center.
    
5. Node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
    - We can form three 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>
    
6. Node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
    - We can form one 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 4, 8)>
    
7. Node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
    - We can form one 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 1, 7)>
    
8. Node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
    - We cannot form any 3-star with node 7 as the center.
    
9. Node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
    - We cannot form any 3-star with node 8 as the center.

10. Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
    - We cannot form any 3-star with node 9 as the center.

In total, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>. Therefore, the final answer is [6].
