Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7
Node 1: 0
Node 2: 7, 9
Node 3: 5, 8
Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 3, 4
Node 6: 4, 9
Node 7: 0, 2, 8
Node 8: 3, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 6

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph. Recall that a 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 0)>
<8, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
