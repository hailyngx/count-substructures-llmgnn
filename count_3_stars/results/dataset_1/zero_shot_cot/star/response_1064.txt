Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all 3-stars in the given graph. 

Nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- 3-star with center node 1: (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 8) [<1, (2, 5, 8)>]
- 3-star with center node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 9) [<2, (1, 5, 2)>, <2, (4, 5, 2)>, <2, (5, 9, 2)>]
- 3-star with center node 3: No 3-star can be formed with center node 3.
- 3-star with center node 4: No 3-star can be formed with center node 4.
- 3-star with center node 5: (5, 1, 2), (5, 4, 6), (5, 6, 7), (5, 6, 9) [<5, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 5)>, <5, (6, 7, 5)>, <5, (6, 9, 5)>]
- 3-star with center node 6: (6, 4, 5), (6, 5, 7), (6, 5, 9) [<6, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (7, 5, 6)>, <6, (9, 5, 6)>]
- 3-star with center node 7: No 3-star can be formed with center node 7.
- 3-star with center node 8: No 3-star can be formed with center node 8.
- 3-star with center node 9: (9, 2, 5), (9, 5, 6) [<9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>]

The unique 3-stars with their center nodes are: 
<1, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 2)>, <2, (4, 5, 2)>, <2, (5, 9, 2)>, <5, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 5)>, <5, (6, 7, 5)>, <5, (6, 9, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (7, 5, 6)>, <6, (9, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
