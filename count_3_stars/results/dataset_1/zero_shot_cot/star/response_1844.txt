Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-star with center node 0: (0, 4, 5, 6)
- 3-star with center node 4: (4, 0, 1, 8)
- 3-star with center node 5: (5, 0, 6, 7)

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
