Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all nodes adjacent to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 8)>   (center and leaves)
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 8)>   <2, (4, 5, 7)>   <2, (5, 7, 8)>   <2, (7, 8, 9)>  (center and leaves)
- Node 3: No 3-star as the node 3 does not have 3 adjacent nodes.
- Node 4: No 3-star as the node 4 does not have 3 adjacent nodes.
- Node 5: No 3-star as the node 5 does not have 3 adjacent nodes.
- Node 6: <6, (3, 7, 9)>  (center and leaves)
- Node 7: <7, (2, 5, 8)>   <7, (5, 6, 9)>  (center and leaves)
- Node 8: No 3-star as the node 8 does not have 3 adjacent nodes.
- Node 9: No 3-star as the node 9 does not have 3 adjacent nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
