Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected by edges to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7. Thus, <0, (1, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. However, none of these connections form a 3-star.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 8. Here, <5, (0, 1, 6)> and <5, (1, 2, 6)> are both 3-stars.
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9. We find <8, (1, 4, 5)> and <8, (5, 6, 9)> as 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>.
