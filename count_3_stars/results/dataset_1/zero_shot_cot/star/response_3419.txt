Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's go through each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. We will list all the 3-stars we find:

1. (0, 6, 1)   -> <0, (6, 1)>
2. (1, 6, 0)   -> <1, (6, 0)>
3. (1, 7, 5)   -> <1, (7, 5)>
4. (2, 4, 5)   -> <2, (4, 5)>
5. (3, 4, 5)   -> <3, (4, 5)>
6. (3, 4, 8)   -> <3, (4, 8)>
7. (3, 8, 7)   -> <3, (8, 7)>
8. (4, 2, 5)   -> <4, (2, 5)>
9. (4, 3, 5)   -> <4, (3, 5)>
10. (4, 5, 2)  -> <4, (5, 2)>
11. (4, 5, 3)  -> <4, (5, 3)>
12. (4, 5, 7)  -> <4, (5, 7)>
13. (4, 5, 3)  -> duplicate, already counted
14. (4, 5, 7)  -> duplicate, already counted
15. (5, 4, 2)  -> <5, (4, 2)>
16. (5, 4, 3)  -> <5, (4, 3)>
17. (5, 4, 7)  -> <5, (4, 7)>
18. (6, 0, 1)  -> duplicate, already counted
19. (6, 1, 0)  -> duplicate, already counted
20. (6, 1, 7)  -> <6, (1, 7)>
21. (6, 7, 5)  -> <6, (7, 5)>
22. (6, 7, 1)  -> duplicate, already counted
23. (6, 7, 5)  -> duplicate, already counted
24. (6, 9, 0)  -> <6, (9, 0)>
25. (7, 1, 6)  -> duplicate, already counted
26. (7, 1, 5)  -> duplicate, already counted
27. (7, 5, 4)  -> <7, (5, 4)>
28. (7, 5, 6)  -> duplicate, already counted
29. (7, 5, 4)  -> duplicate, already counted
30. (7, 5, 6)  -> duplicate, already counted
31. (7, 6, 1)  -> duplicate, already counted
32. (7, 6, 5)  -> duplicate, already counted
33. (7, 8, 3)  -> <7, (8, 3)>
34. (7, 8, 3)  -> duplicate, already counted
35. (7, 8, 3)  -> duplicate, already counted
36. (7, 8, 3)  -> duplicate, already counted
37. (8, 3, 4)  -> duplicate, already counted
38. (8, 3, 7)  -> duplicate, already counted
39. (9, 6, 0)  -> duplicate, already counted

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [17].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 1)>, <1, (7, 5)>, <2, (4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5)>, <3, (4, 8)>, <3, (8, 7)>, <4, (2, 5)>, <4, (3, 5)>, <4, (5, 2)>, <4, (5, 3)>, <4, (5, 7)>, <5, (4, 2)>, <5, (4, 3)>, <5, (4, 7)>, <6, (1, 7)>, <6, (7, 5)>, <6, (9, 0)>, <7, (5, 4)>, <7, (8, 3)>.
