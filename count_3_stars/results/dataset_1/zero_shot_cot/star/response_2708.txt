Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (7, 4, 8)>

By examining the list above, we can see that there are 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
