Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 3, 4
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (7, 6, 5)>
- <2, (6, 3, 5)>
- <3, (6, 8, 2)>
- <4, (8, 9, 5)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 2)>
- <7, (6, 1, 3)>
- <8, (4, 6, 3)>
- <9, (5, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
