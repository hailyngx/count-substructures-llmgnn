Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
6. <6, (0, 1, -)>
7. <8, (3, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
