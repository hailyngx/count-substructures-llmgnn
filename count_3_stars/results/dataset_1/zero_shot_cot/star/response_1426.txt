Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first find all instances of the 3-star pattern <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <0, (2, 1, 5)>
3. <0, (5, 1, 2)>
4. <0, (6, 1, 2)>
5. <0, (6, 2, 1)>
6. <2, (3, 7, 0)>
7. <2, (3, 7, 5)>
8. <3, (2, 7, 5)>
9. <3, (5, 7, 2)>
10. <4, (8, 9, 7)>
11. <7, (3, 9, 5)>
12. <7, (3, 9, 2)>
13. <7, (9, 3, 2)>
14. <7, (9, 3, 5)>
15. <8, (4, 9, 7)>
16. <9, (4, 8, 7)>
17. <9, (7, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [17].
