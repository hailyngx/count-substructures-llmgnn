Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars.  
In this graph, nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8 have exactly three neighbors.  

Step 2: For each potential center, check if its neighbors form a 3-star around it.  
Let's check each potential center one by one:  

For center node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8)  
Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8 form a 3-star around node 3.  
So, the 3-star is <3, (0, 1, 4, 5, 8)>.  

For center node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8)  
Nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 form a 3-star around node 4.  
So, the 3-star is <4, (1, 3, 5, 6, 8)>.  

For center node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7)  
Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7 form a 3-star around node 5.  
So, the 3-star is <5, (2, 3, 4, 7)>.  

For center node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 9)  
Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 form a 3-star around node 8.  
So, the 3-star is <8, (1, 2, 3, 4, 9)>.  

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 1, 4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 4, 7)>, and <8, (1, 2, 3, 4, 9)>.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
