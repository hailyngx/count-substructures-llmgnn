Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. We can then list the other three nodes each center is connected to.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>

In this graph, there are a total of [6] 3-stars.
