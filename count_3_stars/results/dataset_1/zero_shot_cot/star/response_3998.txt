Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 6, 4)>
4. <2, (6, 5, 8)>
5. <6, (2, 5, 9)>
6. <7, (1, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
