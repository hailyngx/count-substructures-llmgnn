Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5)
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8)
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7) 
5. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8)
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7)
8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9)
9. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5)
10. Node 9: (9, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star structures in the graph.

There are 3-stars at the following nodes:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)> and <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 5)> and <6, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [12].
