Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 8

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars:
- For Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 8)> and <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- For Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- For Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)> and <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- For Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)> and <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- For Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 3)> and <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- For Node 9: <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
