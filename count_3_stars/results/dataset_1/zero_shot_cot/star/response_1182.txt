Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step.

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. Since node 0 has exactly two connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. This creates a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 4 as the leaves. <1, (0, 2, 4)>

3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. This creates a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 1, 7, and 9 as the leaves. <2, (1, 7, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to node 8. Since node 3 has only one connection, it cannot form a 3-star.

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5. Since node 4 has exactly two connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9. This creates a 3-star with node 5 as the center and nodes 4, 8, and 9 as the leaves. <5, (4, 8, 9)>

7. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to node 2. Since node 7 has only one connection, it cannot form a 3-star.

8. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9. This creates two 3-stars with node 8 as the center:
     - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
     - <8, (0, 5, 9)>

9. Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. This creates a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 2, 5, and 8 as the leaves. <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
