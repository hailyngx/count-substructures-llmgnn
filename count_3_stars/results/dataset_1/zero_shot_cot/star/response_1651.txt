Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

0: 3, 4, 8
1: 3, 7, 9
2: 6, 7
3: 0, 1, 5, 6
4: 0
5: 3
6: 2, 3, 8, 9
7: 1, 2
8: 0, 6, 9
9: 1, 6, 8

Now, let's go through each node to see if there are any 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 8). So, <0, (3, 4, 8)>.
- Node 1: (1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 9). So, <1, (3, 7, 9)>.
- Node 2: No 3-star configurations.
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 5), (3, 0, 6), (3, 1, 5), (3, 1, 6), (3, 5, 6). So, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, and <3, (0, 5, 6)>.
- Node 4: No 3-star configurations.
- Node 5: No 3-star configurations.
- Node 6: (6, 2, 8), (6, 2, 9), (6, 8, 9). So, <6, (2, 8, 9)>.
- Node 7: No 3-star configurations.
- Node 8: No 3-star configurations.
- Node 9: No 3-star configurations.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)> and <6, (2, 8, 9)>.
