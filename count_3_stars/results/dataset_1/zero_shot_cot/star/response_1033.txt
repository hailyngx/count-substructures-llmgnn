Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
