Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-star graphs.

- Node 0 has 2 edges connected (0, 1) and (0, 9)
- Node 1 has 1 edge connected (0, 1)
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected (3, 8), (3, 9), (8, 3), (9, 3)
- Node 4 has 1 edge connected (4, 9)
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected (5, 8), (5, 9)
- Node 6 has 1 edge connected (6, 7)
- Node 9 has 6 edges connected (0, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (9, 0), (9, 3)

From the nodes identified above, we can see that nodes 3 and 9 can be centers of the 3-star graphs. Let's count the number of 3-stars.

For the center node 3:
- <3, (8, 9, 5)> (or any cyclic permutation)
- <3, (9, 8, 5)> (or any cyclic permutation)

For the center node 9:
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (3, 0, 5)>
- <9, (3, 0, 4)>
- <9, (4, 0, 3)>
- <9, (4, 3, 5)>
- <9, (5, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
