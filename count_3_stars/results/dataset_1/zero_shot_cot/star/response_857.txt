Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in valid 3-star configurations. Since there are 10 nodes in total, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star with the other nodes.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2 and follows the star pattern (0, 2, 4).
<0, (2, 4, X)>

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. Based on the given edges, node 1 cannot form a valid 3-star configuration.

Next is node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4, which form a 3-star when considering node 2 as the center.
<2, (0, 4, X)>

Continuing with node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. However, these connections do not form a 3-star configuration.

Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. We have already considered node 2 as the center for a 3-star configuration, so node 4 cannot form another 3-star.

Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to node 7 but does not form a 3-star configuration.

Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8, forming a valid 3-star with node 6 as the center.
<6, (3, 7, 8)>

Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8, forming another valid 3-star with node 7 as the center.
<7, (5, 6, 8)>

Finally, node 8 and node 9 do not form any additional 3-star configurations based on the given edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, X)> and <6, (3, 7, 8)>.
