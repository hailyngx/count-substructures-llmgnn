Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we will first identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Given the structure of a 3-star graph and the edges provided, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. 3-star with center node 1: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
2. 3-star with center node 2: <2, (5, 8, 3)>
3. 3-star with center node 3: <3, (7, 2, 5)>
4. 3-star with center node 4: No 3-star centered at node 4.
5. 3-star with center node 5: <5, (1, 2, 7)>
6. 3-star with center node 6: No 3-star centered at node 6.
7. 3-star with center node 7: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
8. 3-star with center node 8: <8, (1, 2, 5)>
9. 3-star with center node 9: No 3-star centered at node 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>, <3, (7, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, and <8, (1, 2, 5)>.

Counting these, we have [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
