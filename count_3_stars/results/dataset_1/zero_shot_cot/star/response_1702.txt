Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 38 edges, we need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
