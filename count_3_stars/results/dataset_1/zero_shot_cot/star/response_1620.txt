Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph: 
- For node 0: 
  - <0, (5, 6, 9)>

- For node 1:
  - <1, (6, 7, 9)>

- For node 4:
  - <4, (3, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (6, 8, 5)>

- For node 8:
  - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>

- For node 9:
  - <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [7].
