Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. (1, 3, 6)
2. (2, 3, 9)
3. (3, 0, 5)
4. (3, 1, 2)
5. (3, 5, 7)
6. (3, 9, 7)
7. (5, 3, 8)
8. (5, 6, 8)
9. (7, 3, 9)
10. (9, 2, 5)
11. (9, 3, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
   <1, (3, 6, 1)>
   <2, (3, 9, 2)>
   <3, (0, 5, 3)>
   <3, (1, 2, 3)>
   <3, (5, 7, 3)>
   <3, (7, 9, 3)>
   <5, (3, 8, 5)>
   <5, (6, 8, 5)>
   <7, (3, 9, 7)>
   <9, (2, 5, 9)>
   <9, (3, 7, 9)>
