Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list out the possible 3-stars:

<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
