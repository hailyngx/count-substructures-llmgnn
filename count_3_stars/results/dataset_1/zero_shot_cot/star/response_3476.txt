Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars. 

Given the edges between nodes, we can determine the 3-stars by identifying the central node and the three leaves connected to it. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, -)>
<5, (0, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
