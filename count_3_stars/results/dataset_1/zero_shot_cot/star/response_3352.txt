Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Starting with node 0 as the center:
1. <0, (4, 8, 9)>
2. <0, (4, 8, 9)>

Starting with node 1 as the center:
3. <1, (2, 7, 9)>

Starting with node 4 as the center:
4. <4, (0, 8, 5)>
5. <4, (0, 8, 5)>

Starting with node 5 as the center:
6. <5, (4, 7, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
