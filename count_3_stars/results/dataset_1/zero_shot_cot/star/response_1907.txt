Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 4, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
