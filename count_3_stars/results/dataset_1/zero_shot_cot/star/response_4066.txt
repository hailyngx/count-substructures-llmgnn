Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the possible 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Given the graph description, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
4. <5, (0, 6, 8)>
5. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
6. <7, (4, 6, 8)>
7. <8, (5, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [7].
