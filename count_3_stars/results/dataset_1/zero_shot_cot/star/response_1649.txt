Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with connections to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following central nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes (2, 4, 5)
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes (2, 4, 8)
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 1, 3)
- Node 3 is connected to 2 other nodes (2, 5)
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 1, 6)
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 6)
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (4, 5, 7)
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes (1, 5)
- Node 9 is connected to 1 other node (6)

Now let's construct the unique 3-stars based on the identified central nodes:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph: [6].

Therefore, the answer is [6].
