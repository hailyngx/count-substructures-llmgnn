Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in total.
