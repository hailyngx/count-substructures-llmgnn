Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-star configurations found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the graph.
