Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 cannot form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes (1 and 6).
2. Node 1 can form two 3-stars: <1, (0, 7, 8)> and <1, (7, 8, 9)>.
3. Node 2 cannot form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes (4 and 9).
4. Node 3 cannot form a 3-star since it is connected to only one node (8).
5. Node 4 can form one 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>.
6. Node 5 cannot form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes (4 and 9).
7. Node 6 cannot form a 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes (0 and 7).
8. Node 7 can form two 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)> and <7, (1, 6, 9)>.
9. Node 8 can form one 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
10. Node 9 can form two 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 8)> and <9, (2, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, and <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
