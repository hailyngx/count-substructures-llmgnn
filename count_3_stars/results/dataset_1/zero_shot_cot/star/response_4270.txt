Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

Let's look for 3-stars one by one based on each node as the center. 

1. For node 0:
   - (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8) -> <0, (4, 6, 8)>

2. For node 1:
   - (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9) -> <1, (2, 5, 9)>

3. For node 2:
   - (2, 1), (2, 7) -> No 3-stars exist.

4. For node 3:
   - (3, 7) -> No 3-stars exist.

5. For node 4:
   - No edges connected to node 4.

6. For node 5:
   - (5, 1), (5, 8), (5, 9) -> <5, (1, 8, 9)>

7. For node 6:
   - (6, 0) -> No 3-stars exist.

8. For node 7:
   - (7, 2), (7, 3) -> No 3-stars exist.

9. For node 8:
   - (8, 0), (8, 5) -> No 3-stars exist.

10. For node 9:
   - (9, 1), (9, 5) -> <9, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>.
