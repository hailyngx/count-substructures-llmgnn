Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars and the nodes connected to them will be the leaves.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 5, -)>
4. <3, (6, 8, -)>
5. <4, (1, 8, -)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
7. <6, (3, 5, -)>
8. <8, (0, 3, 4)>
9. <9, (0, -, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get the following list:  
<0, (1, 5, 8)>,  
<1, (0, 2, 4)>,  
<2, (1, 5, -)>,  
<3, (6, 8, -)>,  
<4, (1, 8, -)>,  
<5, (0, 2, 6)>,  
<6, (3, 5, -)>,  
<8, (0, 3, 4)>,  
<9, (0, -, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
