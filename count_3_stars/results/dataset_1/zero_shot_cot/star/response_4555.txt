Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, and 6. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, and 7. <3, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 8. <7, (0, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
