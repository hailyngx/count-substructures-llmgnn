Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 10)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 7 different 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
