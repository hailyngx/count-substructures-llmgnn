Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node of each 3-star. The central node must be a node with exactly 3 adjacent edges. In this graph, nodes 0, 1, and 4 meet this criterion and can act as the central node of a 3-star.

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:
- For central node 0: (6, 9)
- For central node 1: (2, 7)
- For central node 4: (3, 6)

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (2, 7)>
<4, (3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
