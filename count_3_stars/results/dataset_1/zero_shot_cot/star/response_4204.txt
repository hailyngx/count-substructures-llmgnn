Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
    - For node 0: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
    - For node 1: <1, (4, 7, 8)>
    - For node 2: <2, (3, 6, -)>
    - For node 3: <3, (2, -, -)>
    - For node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
    - For node 5: <5, (-, 8, -)>
    - For node 6: <6, (0, 2, 4)>
    - For node 7: <7, (0, 1, 9)>
    - For node 8: <8, (1, 5, 6)>
    - For node 9: <9, (7, -, -)>
    
Counting all unique 3-stars, we get the final answer as [9].
