Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 1)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (4, 5, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
6. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
7. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (2, 6, 2)>
9. <8, (1, 1, 1)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
