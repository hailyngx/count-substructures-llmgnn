Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 9, -)>
<2, (3, 9, -)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, -)>
<5, (1, -,-)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 8 unique 3-stars listed above, so the total number of 3-stars is [8].
