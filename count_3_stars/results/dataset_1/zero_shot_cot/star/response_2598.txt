Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 3)>
- <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
