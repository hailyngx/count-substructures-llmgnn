Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that act as centers connected to exactly three other nodes. The pattern we are looking for is a central node connected to three other nodes, forming a 3-star graph structure.

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 3 acts as a central node since it is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8:
   <3, (2, 7, 8)>

2. Node 5 acts as a central node since it is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9:
   <5, (4, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].
