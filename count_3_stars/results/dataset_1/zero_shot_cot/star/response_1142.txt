Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5)
2. Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 0, 5)
3. Node 3: (3, 4, 5)
4. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 0, 8)
5. Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 3)
6. Node 7: (7, 1, 3)
7. Node 9: (9, 1, 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3)>, <9, (1, 2)>
