Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8. It forms a 3-star with these nodes: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, and <0, (3, 5, 8)>.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. It forms a 3-star with these nodes: <1, (3, 7, 9)>.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. It forms a 3-star with these nodes: <2, (0, 8, 3)>.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9. It forms 3-stars with these nodes: <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, and <3, (1, 8, 9)>.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9. It forms a 3-star with these nodes: <4, (7, 8, 9)>.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9. It forms a 3-star with these nodes: <5, (0, 7, 9)>.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9. It forms a 3-star with these nodes: <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, and <7, (4, 5, 9)>.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4. It forms a 3-star with these nodes: <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, and <8, (2, 3, 4)>.

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7. It forms a 3-star with the nodes: <9, (1, 4, 5)> and <9, (1, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 3)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, and <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
