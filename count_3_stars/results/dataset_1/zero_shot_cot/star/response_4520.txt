Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
