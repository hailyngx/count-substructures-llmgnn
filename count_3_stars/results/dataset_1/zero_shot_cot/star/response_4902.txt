Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>  
<0, (3, 4, 8)>  
<0, (3, 5, 8)>  
<0, (4, 5, 8)>  

<1, (2, 6, 7)>  

<2, (1, 6, 8)>  

<3, (0, 4, 7)>  

<5, (7, 8, 9)>  

<6, (1, 2, 7)>  
<6, (1, 6, 9)>  

<7, (1, 3, 6)>  
<7, (1, 5, 8)>  
<7, (3, 4, 8)>  
<7, (5, 6, 8)>  

<8, (2, 5, 7)>  
<8, (3, 4, 7)>  
<8, (5, 7, 9)>  

<9, (5, 6, 8)>
