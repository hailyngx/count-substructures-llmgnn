Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star pattern with exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3. So, we have <0, (1, 2, 3)>.

2. Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7. So, we have <1, (0, 6, 7)>.

3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6. So, we have <2, (0, 4, 6)>.

4. Node 3: Does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 9, and 5. So, we have <4, (2, 9, 5)>.

6. Node 5: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 8. So, we have <5, (0, 6, 8)>.

7. Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5. So, we have <6, (1, 2, 5)>.

8. Node 7: Does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 8: Does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7. So, we have <9, (0, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
