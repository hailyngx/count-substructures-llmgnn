Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its three adjacent nodes. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, X)> (where X represents a node that is not included in the edge list)
<7, (4, 9, X)> (where X represents a node that is not included in the edge list)
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
