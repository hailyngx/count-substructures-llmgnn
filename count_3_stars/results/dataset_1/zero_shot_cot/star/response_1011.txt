Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [8].
