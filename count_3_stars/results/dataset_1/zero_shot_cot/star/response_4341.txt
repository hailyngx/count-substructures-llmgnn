Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections:

- Node 1 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 4, 6.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, 7, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 2, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 3, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 4.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- For Node 1: 0
- For Node 2: 0
- For Node 3: 0
- For Node 4: 1  (4, 2, 5)
- For Node 5: 2  (5, 4, 1)  (5, 4, 7)
- For Node 6: 0
- For Node 7: 0
- For Node 8: 2  (8, 5, 7)  (8, 5, 6)
- For Node 9: 0

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 5, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 5)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
