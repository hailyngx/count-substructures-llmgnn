Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the given graph:

(0): [3, 6, 7, 8]
(1): [6, 7, 9]
(2): [7, 8, 9]
(3): [0, 5, 7]
(4): [6]
(5): [3]
(6): [0, 1, 4, 8]
(7): [0, 1, 2, 3, 8]
(8): [0, 2, 6, 7]
(9): [1, 2]

Now, let's locate 3-stars in the graph:
- Looking at the above connections, we see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 have 3 or more connections and can act as potential center nodes for a 3-star.
- For each potential center node, we will identify the nodes that are connected to it and form a 3-star with these nodes.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
