Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
4. 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
5. 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
6. 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 3)>
7. 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
