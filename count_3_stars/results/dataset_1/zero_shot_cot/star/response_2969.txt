Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Central node 0 connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9: 
    <0, (6, 7, 9)>

2. Central node 1 connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9: 
    <1, (2, 3, 9)>

3. Central node 6 connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9: 
    <6, (0, 4, 9)>

4. Central node 9 connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6: 
    <9, (0, 1, 6)>
