Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:

Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 1: 2, 3, 9  
Node 2: 0, 1, 4  
Node 3: 0, 1  
Node 4: 2, 8  
Node 6: 0, 9  
Node 7: 0, 9  
Node 8: 0, 4  
Node 9: 1, 6, 7  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.  

[<0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>]
