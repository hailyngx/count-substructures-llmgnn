Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
