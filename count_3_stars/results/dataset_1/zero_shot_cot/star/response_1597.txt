Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, -)>
<6, (2, 8, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
