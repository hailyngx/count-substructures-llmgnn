Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

We will start by listing all the possible 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 9, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
