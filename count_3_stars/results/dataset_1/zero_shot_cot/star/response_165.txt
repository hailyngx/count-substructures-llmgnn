Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The center node of the 3-star must have degree 3, and in this case, nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6 have degree 5, nodes 2 and 5 have degree 3, and nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9 have degree 2. This means that nodes 2 and 5 are the only nodes that can be the center nodes of the 3-stars.

Now let's check the possible 3-stars:  
- For center node 2: 
    - <2, (0, 4, 7)>  
    - <2, (0, 4, 7)>  

- For center node 5:  
    - <5, (1, 4, 6)>  
    - <5, (1, 4, 6)>  

Hence, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
