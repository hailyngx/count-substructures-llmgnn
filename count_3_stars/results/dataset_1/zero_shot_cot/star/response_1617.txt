Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each potential 3-star by locating a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<7, (1, 6, 0)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

By listing all the unique 3-stars found, we can see that there are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
