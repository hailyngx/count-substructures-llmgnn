Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph: 

- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 5)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
