Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's consider each node as the center of a potential 3-star and check which nodes are connected to it. 

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
  
2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 4, 2)>
  
3. For node 2:
   - <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (5, 8, 7)>
  
4. For node 3:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only 3 nodes.
  
5. For node 4:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
  
6. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 2, 3)>
  
7. For node 6:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
  
8. For node 7:
   - <7, (0, 2, 3)>
  
9. For node 8:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
  
10. For node 9:
   - No 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 7)>
