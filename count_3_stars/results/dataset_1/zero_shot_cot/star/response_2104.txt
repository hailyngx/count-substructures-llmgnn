Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Given the constraints of a 3-star graph, we can determine a 3-star by looking for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 2)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
