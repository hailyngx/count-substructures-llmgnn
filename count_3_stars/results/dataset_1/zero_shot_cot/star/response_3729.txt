Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 5, 6, 8   
Node 1: 2, 6   
Node 2: 1, 6   
Node 3: 4   
Node 4: 3, 5, 6   
Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 7   
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9   
Node 7: 5, 9   
Node 8: 0   
Node 9: 6, 7   

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph.  
Let's list them:  

<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<1, (2, 6, 0)>  
<2, (1, 6, 0)>  
<4, (3, 5, 6)>  
<5, (0, 4, 6), (7, 6, 0)>  
<6, (0, 1, 2), (4, 5, 7), (9, 7, 0)>  
<7, (5, 9, 6)>  
<9, (6, 7, 0)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
