Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if there are edges connecting it to exactly three other nodes. 

1. The nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3.

2. Counting the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, 7.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 6.

3. Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
