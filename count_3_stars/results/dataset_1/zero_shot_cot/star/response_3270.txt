Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 0 has edges to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8 (4 edges connected).
   - Node 1 has edges to nodes 0, 5, and 9 (3 edges connected).
   - Node 2 has edges to nodes 5, 7, and 9 (3 edges connected).
   - Node 3 has edges to nodes 6 and 8 (2 edges connected).
   - Node 5 has edges to nodes 1 and 2 (2 edges connected).
   - Node 6 has edges to nodes 0 and 3 (2 edges connected).
   - Node 7 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 9 (3 edges connected).
   - Node 8 has edges to nodes 0 and 3 (2 edges connected).
   - Node 9 has edges to nodes 1, 2, and 7 (3 edges connected).

2. List the 3-stars by identifying the central node and the connected leaf nodes:
   - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 7)>
  
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
