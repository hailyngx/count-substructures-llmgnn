Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8

2. List the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [13]
