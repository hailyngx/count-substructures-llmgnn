Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 5)
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 9)
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3)
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's list the unique 3-star structures:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (5, 9)>
<4, (6, 9)>
<7, (0, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
