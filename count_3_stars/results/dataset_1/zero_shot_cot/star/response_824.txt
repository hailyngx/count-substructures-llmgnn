Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them. Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9) -> <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9) -> <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8) -> <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5) -> <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (3, 5, 0)>
- Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8) -> <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8) -> <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6) -> <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2) -> <9, (0, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].

<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (3, 5, 0)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
