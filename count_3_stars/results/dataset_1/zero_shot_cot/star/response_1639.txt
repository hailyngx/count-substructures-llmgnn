Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 
Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 1, 2), since node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
    - (0, 1, 9), since node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 8.

2. Node 1:
    - (1, 0, 3), since node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.

3. Node 3:
    - (3, 1, 4), since node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
    - (3, 1, 9), since node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 6.

4. Node 5:
    - (5, 7, 9), since node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 25.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 9>, <1, 0, 3>, <3, 1, 4>, <5, 7, 9>>.
