Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find all the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7 forming three 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    <0, (2, 4, 7)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 5 forming one 3-star:
    <2, (0, 5, 5)>

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9 forming one 3-star:
    <4, (0, 5, 9)>

4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7 forming four 3-stars:
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>
    <5, (2, 4, 7)>

5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 9, but this doesn't form a 3-star configuration.

6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9 forming one 3-star:
    <7, (0, 5, 9)>

7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, but this doesn't form a 3-star configuration.

8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7 forming one 3-star:
    <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
These 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
