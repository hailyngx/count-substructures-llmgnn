Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

There are 10 nodes and the edges are as follows:
(0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 5).

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (4, 9), (3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 5), (4, 5)>
- <2, (7, 7), (7, 6)>
- <3, (1, 3), (4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 4), (3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 5), (4, 9)>
- <6, (7, 6), (8, 6)>
- <7, (2, 7), (6, 8)>
- <8, (3, 8), (6, 8)>
- <9, (0, 9), (5, 9)>

So, there are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [9].
