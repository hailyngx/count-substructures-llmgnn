Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (8, 5, 6)>, <2, (8, 5, 1)>
3. Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 0)>, <4, (0, 5, 3)>
4. Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (8, 2, 4)>, <5, (8, 2, 1)>
5. Node 8: <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 2)>
6. Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (8, 5, 6)>, <2, (8, 5, 1)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 0)>, <4, (0, 5, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (8, 2, 4)>, <5, (8, 2, 1)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 4)>, <8, (3, 5, 2)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 5)>, <9, (7, 4, 0)>
