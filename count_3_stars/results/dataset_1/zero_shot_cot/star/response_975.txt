Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is not a part of any 3-star since it is only connected to 1 node (node 7).
2. Node 1 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to 1 node (node 5).
3. Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes (nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9), forming the following 3-stars:
   <2, (4, 5, 8)>
   <2, (4, 5, 9)>
   <2, (5, 8, 9)>
4. Node 3 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to 2 nodes (nodes 6 and 8).
5. Node 4 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to 1 node (node 2).
6. Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes (nodes 1, 2, and 6), forming the following 3-stars:
   <5, (1, 2, 6)>
7. Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes (nodes 3, 5, and 7), forming the following 3-stars:
   <6, (3, 5, 7)>
8. Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes (nodes 0, 6, and 8), forming the following 3-stars:
   <7, (0, 6, 8)>
9. Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes (nodes 2, 3, and 7), forming the following 3-stars:
   <8, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
