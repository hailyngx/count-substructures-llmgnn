Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

    - The central node can be any of the 10 nodes in the graph.
    - For each central node, we need to find the number of 3-stars that can be formed.

Looking at the given edges, the 3-stars can be formed as follows:

    - For node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    - For node 1: <1, (0, 5, 7)> and <1, (2, 7, 9)>
    - For node 2: <2, (1, 6, -)>
    - For node 3: No 3-star can be formed as it only has 4 neighbors.
    - For node 4: <4, (0, 3, -)>
    - For node 5: <5, (0, 1, -)>
    - For node 6: <6, (2, 3, 7)>
    - For node 7: <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - For node 8: <8, (3, 7, 9)>
    - For node 9: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [9]

Unique 3-stars found: 
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (0, 3, -)>
    - <5, (0, 1, -)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <8, (3, 7, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
