Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <1, (3, 4, 4)>
    - <3, (1, 9, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <8, (4, 7, 7)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
