Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (3, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are [10] 3-stars.
