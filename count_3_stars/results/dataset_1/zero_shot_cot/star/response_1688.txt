Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by identifying the central nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [2] 3-stars.
