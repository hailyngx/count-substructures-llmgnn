Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.  
     Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star pattern.
 
     For node 0: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9)
     For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6)
     For node 4: (4, 1), (4, 8)
     For node 6: (6, 1)
     For node 7: (7, 9)

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found:

    <0, (2, 5, 8)>
    <0, (2, 8, 9)>
    <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    <4, (1, 8, 2)>
    <7, (9)>
    
Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

    There are 5 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
