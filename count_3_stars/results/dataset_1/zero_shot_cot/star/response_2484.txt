Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's list down all the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
