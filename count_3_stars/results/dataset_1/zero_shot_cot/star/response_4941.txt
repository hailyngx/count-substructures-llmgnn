Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
