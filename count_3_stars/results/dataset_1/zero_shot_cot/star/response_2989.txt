Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 

The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed below:
(0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7)

Now, let's identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 5, 3)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
