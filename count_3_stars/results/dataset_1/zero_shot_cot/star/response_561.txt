Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for every node that has exactly three edges connected to it. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars. We will then list the other nodes connected to each center node to form the 3-stars. 

The nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8. These will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Now, let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
