Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 8, -)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
