Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's analyze each node to determine how many edges are incident to each node:

- Node 0: 3 edges
- Node 1: 2 edges
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 3: 2 edges
- Node 4: 3 edges
- Node 5: 2 edges
- Node 6: 1 edge
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 8: 2 edges
- Node 9: 2 edges

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided:

- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 7, 7)>
- <2, (1, 9, 9)>
- <3, (0, 9, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
