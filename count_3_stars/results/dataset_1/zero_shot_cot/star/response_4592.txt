Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list the 3-stars first and then count them. 

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (2, 8, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (3, 9, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 

[8]
