Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [7].
