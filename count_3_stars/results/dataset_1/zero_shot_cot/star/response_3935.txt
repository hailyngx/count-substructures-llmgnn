Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here, we'll list all the unique 3-stars found.

1. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (6, 8, -)>  (Note: Node 2 only has 2 connections, so the missing connection is represented by "-")
4. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 5, -)>  (Note: Node 4 only has 2 connections, so the missing connection is represented by "-")
6. <5, (4, 7, -)>  (Note: Node 5 only has 2 connections, so the missing connection is represented by "-")
7. <6, (1, 2, -)>  (Note: Node 6 only has 2 connections, so the missing connection is represented by "-")
8. <7, (5, 9, -)>  (Note: Node 7 only has 2 connections, so the missing connection is represented by "-")
9. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
10. <9, (0, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
