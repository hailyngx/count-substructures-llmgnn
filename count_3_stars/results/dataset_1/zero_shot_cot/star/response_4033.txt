Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. 

Let's list the central nodes and their adjacent nodes.

1. Central node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
2. Central node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
3. Central node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
4. Central node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Central node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
6. Central node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
7. Central node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
8. Central node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
9. Central node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
10. Central node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (8, 0, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
