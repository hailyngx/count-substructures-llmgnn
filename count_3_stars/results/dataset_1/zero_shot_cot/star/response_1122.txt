Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are a few steps we can follow to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

Step 1: Identify the central nodes of 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly 3 edges adjacent to them.

Step 2: For each central node identified in Step 1, find all possible combinations of three leaves connected to that central node.

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars formed based on the combinations of central nodes and leaves.

Let's go through these steps:

Step 1: Central nodes with exactly 3 edges adjacent to them are nodes 1, 2, and 9.

Step 2: Possible combinations of leaves for each central node:
- For central node 1: Leaves can be (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 9), (2, 6, 9), or (4, 6, 9).
- For central node 2: Leaves can be (0, 4, 9) or (1, 4, 9).
- For central node 9: Leaves can be (1, 2, 5).

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
