Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves for each 3-star. 

Let's start by listing all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 9, 4)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get [6].
