Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are three 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
