Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, -)>
<4, (7, -, -)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, -)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, -)>
<9, (0, 5, -)>

Now, let's count how many unique 3-stars we have found.
