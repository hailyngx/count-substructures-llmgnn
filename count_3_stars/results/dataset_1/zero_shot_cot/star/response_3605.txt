Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of ways to choose a center node (1 choice for each 3-star) and then multiplying by the number of ways to choose 3 leaves from the remaining nodes. 

We first identify the center nodes in the graph:
- Node 3 has degree 5 (connected to 5 other nodes)
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4

Considering the center nodes identified above, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 6)>

After examining all center nodes, we found a total of [16] 3-stars in the graph.
