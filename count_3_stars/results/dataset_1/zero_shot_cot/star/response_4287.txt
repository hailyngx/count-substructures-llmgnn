Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. Let's count them step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Step 2: For each node, check if they form a 3-star with the connected nodes.
- Node 0: No 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-star
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>
- Node 9: No 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

[9]
