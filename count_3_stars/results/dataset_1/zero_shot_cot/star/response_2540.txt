Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 4)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 8)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 5)
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 5), (4, 1, 6)
6. Node 5: (5, 3, 4), (5, 3, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 4, 8), (6, 4, 9)
8. Node 7: (7, 5, 9)
9. Node 8: (8, 2, 6), (8, 2, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 6, 7), (9, 6, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18]. 

<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 8, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>
