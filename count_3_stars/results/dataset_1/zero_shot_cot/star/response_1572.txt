Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 6)>.
3. Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 5)>.
4. Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
5. Node 4 is not part of any 3-star.
6. Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 7)> and <5, (3, 6, 7)>.
7. Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 7)>.
8. Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.
9. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<1, (3, 5, 6)>  
<2, (0, 3, 5)>  
<3, (1, 2, 5)>  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>  
<5, (3, 6, 7)>  
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
