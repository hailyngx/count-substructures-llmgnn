Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Let's list down all the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1 and 6
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 3 and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6
- Node 8: Connected to node 2
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1 and 4

2. We can now identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>

3. Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
