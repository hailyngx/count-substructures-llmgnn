Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and leaves connected to them.
The possible 3-star configurations are as follows:
1. <0, (7, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
3. <1, (5, 7, 8)>
4. <1, (7, 8, 9)>
5. <2, (1, 6, -)>
6. <3, (5, 8, -)>
7. <4, (6, - , -)>
8. <5, (1, 3, 7)>
9. <6, (2, 4, -)>
10. <7, (0, 1, 5)>
11. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
12. <9, (0, 1, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
