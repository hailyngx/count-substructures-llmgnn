Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph: 
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
