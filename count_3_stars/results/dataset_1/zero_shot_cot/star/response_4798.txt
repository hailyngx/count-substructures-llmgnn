Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star and then count how many of them exist in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

From the above list, we can see that there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
