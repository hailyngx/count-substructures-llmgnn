Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the center nodes. Since a 3-star has exactly 4 nodes (1 center node and 3 leaves), we can start by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors in the graph. 

From the given edges, we can see that node 0 has 4 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, node 2 has 5 neighbors, node 3 has 5 neighbors, node 4 has 6 neighbors, node 5 has 3 neighbors, node 6 has 4 neighbors, node 7 has 6 neighbors, node 8 has 5 neighbors, and node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the center nodes for potential 3-stars in this graph are nodes 1, 5, and 9.

Next, let's examine each potential center node along with its neighbors and determine if they form 3-stars. 

For center node 1:
- (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8)
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>

For center node 5:
- (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6)
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>

For center node 9:
- (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7)
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
