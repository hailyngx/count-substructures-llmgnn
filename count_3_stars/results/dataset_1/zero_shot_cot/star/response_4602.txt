Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and identify the corresponding leaves to form the 3-stars.
- Node 0: (0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 4, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 2, 5, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 5, 6, 7)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 8)>
<4, (5, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 9)>
<7, (8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
