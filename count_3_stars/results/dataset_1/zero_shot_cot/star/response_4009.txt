Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph to better understand its structure. 

Given the edges:
(0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) 
(1, 3) (1, 4) 
(2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) 
(3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) 
(4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) 
(5, 0) (5, 3) 
(8, 2) (8, 9) 
(9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

The graph can be presented as follows:

0 -- 2 -- 8
|  / |  / |
5    4    9
   \ |  \ |
     3 -- 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

We have one 3-star centered at node 0:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>

We have one 3-star centered at node 2:
<2, (0, 4, 8)>

We have one 3-star centered at node 8:
<8, (2, 9, -)>

We have one 3-star centered at node 9:
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
