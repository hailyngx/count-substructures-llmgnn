Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to consider each node as a potential center node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 8)>
<3, (8, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 0, 0)>
<8, (2, 3, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
