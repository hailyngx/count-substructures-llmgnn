Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph. The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can observe the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 1)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 2)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
