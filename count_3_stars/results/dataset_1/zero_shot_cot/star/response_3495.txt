Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Possible 3-star centered at node 0:
    - Nodes connected to 0: 1, 3, 9
    <0, (1, 3, 9)>

2. Possible 3-star centered at node 1:
    - Nodes connected to 1: 0, 6, 8, 9
    <1, (0, 6, 8)> 
    <1, (0, 6, 9)> 
    <1, (0, 8, 9)> 

3. Possible 3-star centered at node 2:
    - Nodes connected to 2: 4, 5, 9
    <2, (4, 5, 9)>

4. Possible 3-star centered at node 3:
    - Nodes connected to 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
    <3, (0, 6, 8)> 
    <3, (0, 6, 9)> 
    <3, (0, 8, 9)>

5. Possible 3-star centered at node 4:
    - Nodes connected to 4: 2, 8, 9
    <4, (2, 8, 9)>

6. Possible 3-star centered at node 5:
    - Nodes connected to 5: 2, 7
    <5, (2, 7, 9)>

7. Possible 3-star centered at node 6:
    - Nodes connected to 6: 1, 3, 8
    <6, (1, 3, 8)>

8. Possible 3-star centered at node 7:
    - Nodes connected to 7: 5, 9
    <7, (5, 9, 0)>

9. Possible 3-star centered at node 8:
    - Nodes connected to 8: 1, 3, 4, 6
    <8, (1, 3, 4)>
    <8, (1, 3, 6)>
    <8, (1, 4, 6)>

10. Possible 3-star centered at node 9:
    - Nodes connected to 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
    <9, (0, 1, 2)>
    <9, (0, 1, 3)>
    <9, (0, 2, 3)>
    <9, (1, 2, 4)>
    <9, (3, 4, 8)>
    <9, (5, 7, 0)>
