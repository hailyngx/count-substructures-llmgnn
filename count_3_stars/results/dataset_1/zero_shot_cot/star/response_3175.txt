Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central node for each potential 3-star. 

The 3-star structures can occur around nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. We will specifically look for 3-stars around central nodes 1, 8, and 9 since they have degrees of 5, 4, and 5 respectively.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Now, we'll count the number of unique 3-stars and provide the final answer inside brackets.
