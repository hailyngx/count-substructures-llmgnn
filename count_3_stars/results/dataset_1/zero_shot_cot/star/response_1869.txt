Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.

Now, we will identify the 3-star configurations by looking for central nodes that are each connected to exactly three other nodes:
1. Central node 0: (0, 2, 9)
2. Central node 1: (1, 2, 8)
3. Central node 2: (2, 1, 7), (2, 6, 8)
4. Central node 3: (3, 5, 7), (3, 7, 9)
5. Central node 6: (6, 2, 7)
6. Central node 8: (8, 1, 9)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.  
[6]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 9)>
<1, (2, 8)>
<2, (1, 7)>
<2, (6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7)>
<3, (7, 9)>
