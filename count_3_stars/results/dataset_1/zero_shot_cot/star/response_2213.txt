Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the provided edges:

<0, (1, 6, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>


Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
<0, (1, 6, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
