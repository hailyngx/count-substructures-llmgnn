Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, -)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 5, -)>
5. <4, (2, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 3, 4)>
7. <7, (1, 4, 9)>
8. <9, (2, 7, -)>
9. <8, (2, 4, 6)> 

Therefore, there are 9 3-stars in the given graph.   
So, the final answer is [9].
