Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present.

Let's list the 3-stars by identifying the center node and the leaf nodes:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 9, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
