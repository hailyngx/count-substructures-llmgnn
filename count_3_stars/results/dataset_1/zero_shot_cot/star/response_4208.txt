Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected neighbors. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 3)>
<2, (3, 5, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (7)>
<7, (6)>
<8, (4)>
<9, (5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
