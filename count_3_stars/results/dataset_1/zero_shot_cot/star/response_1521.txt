Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

Given that a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by looking at each node in the graph and determine if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, -)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (3, 4, -)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
