Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, -)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, -)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, -)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [10] 3-stars.
