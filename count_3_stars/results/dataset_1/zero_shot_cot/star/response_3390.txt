Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3.  
Nodes with degree 3 are 0, 5, 6, 9.  
  
Step 2: For each node with degree 3, check if it forms a 3-star.  
- For node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 9) are 3-stars.  
- For node 5: (5, 1, 7), (5, 7, 9) are 3-stars.  
- For node 6: (6, 4, 7), (6, 7, 9) are 3-stars.  
- For node 9: (9, 0, 5), (9, 5, 6) are 3-stars.  

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
Total 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)> [4].
