Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph.  

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
