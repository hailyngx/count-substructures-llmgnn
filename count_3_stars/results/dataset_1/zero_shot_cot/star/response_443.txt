Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the unique 3-stars.

The center node of a 3-star can be any node in the graph with at least 3 edges connected to it. Then, we will find all possible combinations of 3 neighboring nodes connected to the center node to form a 3-star.

After identifying all unique 3-stars, the final count will be the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (3, 5, 8). So, <0, (3, 5, 8)> forms a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (2, 7, 8, 9). So, <1, (2, 7, 8)> and <1, (2, 7, 9)> form 3-stars.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4, 6, 8). So, <2, (1, 4, 8)> and <2, (1, 6, 8)> form 3-stars.
4. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 6, 8). So, <4, (2, 3, 8)> and <4, (2, 6, 8)> form 3-stars.
5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (0, 7, 9). So, <5, (0, 7, 9)> forms a 3-star.
6. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 2, 4). So, <8, (0, 1, 4)> and <8, (0, 2, 4)> form 3-stars.
7. Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7] <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>.
