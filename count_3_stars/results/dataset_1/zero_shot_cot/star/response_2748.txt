Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the possible combinations of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 9)
   - <0, (2, 7, 9)>

2. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5)
   - <2, (0, 5, 7)>

3. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)
   - <5, (2, 4, 6)> 

4. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4)
   - <7, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
