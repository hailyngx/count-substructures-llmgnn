Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node and its three connected leaves. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
