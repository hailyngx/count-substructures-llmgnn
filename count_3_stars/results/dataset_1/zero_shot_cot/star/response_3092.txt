Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 4, 9)>
3. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (3, 4, 9)>
4. 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (2, 6, 9)>
7. 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (5, 7, -)>
8. 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (3, 4, 6)>
9. 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 5, 7)>
10. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
