Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 4, 8)

2. Node 2:
    - (2, 4, 7)

3. Node 4:
    - (4, 0, 8)
    - (4, 2, 6)
    - (4, 6, 8)

4. Node 6:
    - (6, 4, 8)
    - (6, 8, 9)

5. Node 8:
    - (8, 0, 4)
    - (8, 4, 6)
    - (8, 5, 9)
    - (8, 6, 9)

6. Node 9:
    - (9, 6, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 8)>
<2, (4, 7)>
<4, (0, 8)>
<4, (2, 6)>
<4, (6, 8)>
<6, (4, 8)>
<6, (8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4)>
<8, (4, 6)>
<8, (5, 9)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8)>

Count: 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
