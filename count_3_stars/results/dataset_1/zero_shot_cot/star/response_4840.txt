Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-star structures.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. The central node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
2. The central node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
3. The central node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9: <3, (1, 5, 9)>
4. The central node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
5. The central node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
6. The central node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8: <7, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
