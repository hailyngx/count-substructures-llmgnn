Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors, which could potentially form 3-star graphs. 
Nodes 0 and 3 have 4 neighbors each, so they cannot be the centers of 3-stars. 
Nodes 2, 5, and 9 have 3 neighbors each, making them possible central nodes for 3-stars. 

Now, let's examine each potential center and its neighbors to determine if they form 3-stars:
1. Node 2: (0, 2, 3)
2. Node 5: (7, 5, 9)
3. Node 9: (3, 6, 5)

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 2)>
<5, (7, 9, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
