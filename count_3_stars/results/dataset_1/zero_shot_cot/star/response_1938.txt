Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that are connected to exactly two other nodes. These can be the central nodes of the 3-stars. Then, we identify the nodes that are connected to the central node to complete the 3-star.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
   <0, (1, 2, 7)>

2. Node 1 is also connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8. However, node 0 has already been considered, so we don't count node 1 again.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. We don't count node 1 again since it has already been considered.

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
   <6, (1, 2, 7)>
   <6, (1, 2, 9)>
   <6, (1, 4, 7)>
   <6, (1, 4, 9)>
   <6, (1, 5, 7)>
   <6, (1, 5, 9)>
   <6, (2, 4, 7)>
   <6, (2, 4, 9)>
   <6, (2, 5, 7)>
   <6, (2, 5, 9)>

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
   <4, (6, 8, 0)>

6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4. However, we have already considered node 1 and 4 in other 3-stars.

7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. We don't count node 3 again since it's not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12.
