Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the edges provided, we can start by identifying the central node and the nodes connected to it.

From the edges provided, we can see that the central node is node 0, and it is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on this information:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
