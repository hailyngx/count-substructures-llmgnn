Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes in a 3-star graph are those with exactly 3 neighbors. In this case, nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8 are the central nodes.

Next, let's identify the leaves of each 3-star. For each central node, we will find the nodes that it is connected to.

- For node 2: (2, 4, 5), (2, 6, 7)
- For node 3: (3, 1, 7), (3, 8, 9)
- For node 4: (4, 2, 6), (4, 6, 9)
- For node 8: (8, 3, 5)

Thus, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (8, 9, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
