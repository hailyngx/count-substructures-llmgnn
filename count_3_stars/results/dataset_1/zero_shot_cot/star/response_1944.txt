Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify each node's neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 7

Now, to find the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 6)>  # Note: This 3-star has a self-loop for node 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
