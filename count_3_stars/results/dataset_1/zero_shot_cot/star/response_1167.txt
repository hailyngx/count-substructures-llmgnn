Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Center node: 0
   Leaves: 4, 6, 9
   <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Center node: 3
   Leaves: 1, 2, 6
   <3, (1, 2, 6)>

3. Center node: 4
   Leaves: 0, 2, 7
   <4, (0, 2, 7)>

4. Center node: 5
   Leaves: 2, 7, 9
   <5, (2, 7, 9)>

5. Center node: 6
   Leaves: 0, 3, 8
   <6, (0, 3, 8)>

6. Center node: 8
   Leaves: 3, 6
   <8, (3, 6)>

7. Center node: 9
   Leaves: 0, 5
   <9, (0, 5)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
