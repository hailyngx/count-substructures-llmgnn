Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (4, 8, 9)
2. Node 4: (0, 2, 6)
3. Node 6: (1, 4, 5)
4. Node 8: (0, 2, 5)
5. Node 9: (0, 6, 0)

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
