Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars by observing which nodes have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list them:
1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)   =>   <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9)   =>   <2, (3, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)   =>   <3, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8)   =>   <4, (0, 1, 3)>
5. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)   =>   <8, (2, 4, 6)>
   
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>.
