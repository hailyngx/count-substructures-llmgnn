Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's list the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: [3, 4, 5]
- Node 1: [2, 5, 6]
- Node 2: [1, 3, 7, 8]
- Node 3: [0, 2, 5, 8]
- Node 4: [0, 6]
- Node 5: [0, 1, 3]
- Node 6: [1, 4, 7]
- Node 7: [2, 6]
- Node 8: [2, 3]

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
