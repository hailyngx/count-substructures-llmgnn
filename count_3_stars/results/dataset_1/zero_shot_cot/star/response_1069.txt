Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 6)>

Since each 3-star is counted twice in the above list, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
