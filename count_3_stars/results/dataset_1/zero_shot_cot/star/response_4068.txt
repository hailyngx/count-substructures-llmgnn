Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star in this graph.
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 9
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5
- Node 8: 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 6)> 
2. <0, (2, 6, 9)> 
3. <0, (4, 6, 8)> 
4. <0, (6, 8, 9)>
5. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
6. <2, (0, 9, 3)>
7. <4, (0, 8, 6)>
8. <6, (0, 8, 4)>
9. <7, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
