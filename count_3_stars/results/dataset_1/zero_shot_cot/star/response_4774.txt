Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph must have a degree of 3, meaning they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Looking at the edges, the nodes with degree 3 are node 4 and node 6. Let's identify the 3-stars around these central nodes:
- For node 4: (4, 1, 2, 3), (4, 1, 3, 5), (4, 1, 5, 7), (4, 1, 7, 8)
                        (4, 2, 1, 3), (4, 2, 3, 5), (4, 2, 5, 6), (4, 2, 6, 7)
                        (4, 3, 1, 2), (4, 3, 1, 5), (4, 3, 2, 5), (4, 3, 5, 7)
- For node 6: (6, 0, 2, 4), (6, 0, 4, 7), (6, 2, 0, 4), (6, 2, 4, 7)

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 1, 5)>, <4, (3, 2, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
