Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Given graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 5)

Let's find the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 6)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2)>
<6, (0, 1)>
<6, (7, 8)>
<9, (1, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [7]
