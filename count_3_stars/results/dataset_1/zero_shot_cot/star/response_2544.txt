Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only one node.
- Node 1 is the central node of two 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 3)> and <1, (4, 5, 6)>.
- Node 2 is the central node of one 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 5)>.
- Node 3 is the central node of one 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 5)>.
- Node 4 is the central node of three 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (7, 9, 2)>, and <4, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star since it only has connections to node 2 and node 3.
- Node 6 is the central node of three 3-stars: <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (7, 8, 4)>, and <6, (3, 4, 7)>.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star since it only has connections to node 4 and node 6.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only one node.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only one node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (7, 9, 2)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, and <6, (2, 3, 4)>.
