Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Starting from node 0:
- <0, (4, 6, 1)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>

Moving on to node 1:
- <1, (3, 4, 0)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>

Continuing with node 2:
- No 3-star centered at node 2.

Next, node 3:
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 0)>

Moving to node 4:
- <4, (0, 6, 1)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 3, 0)>
- <4, (3, 1, 9)>
- <4, (3, 1, 0)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 0)>

Continuing with node 5:
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 0)>
- <5, (7, 4, 9)>
- <5, (7, 4, 0)>

Next, node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 0, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>

Moving on to node 7:
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 0)>
- <7, (4, 8, 5)>
- <7, (4, 8, 0)>

Continuing with node 8:
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 6)>
- <8, (5, 4, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 4)>
- <8, (6, 2, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 2)>
- <8, (7, 6, 2)>
- <8, (7, 6, 5)>
- <8, (7, 2, 6)>
- <8, (7, 5, 4)>

Finally, node 9:
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 4, 3)>
- <9, (3, 1, 4)>
- <9, (3, 4, 1)>
- <9, (4, 1, 3)>
- <9, (4, 3, 1)>
- <9, (4, 8, 5)>
- <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
