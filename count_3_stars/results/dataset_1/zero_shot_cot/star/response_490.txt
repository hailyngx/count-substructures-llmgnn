Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with three edges are the potential central nodes for 3-stars. They are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Let's check each potential central node to see if they form a 3-star:

1. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6) - This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center.  
2. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6) - This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center.
3. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6) - This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center.
4. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4) - This does not form a 3-star as it only has 2 edges.
5. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9) - This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center.
6. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6) - This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:

<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)> 
<8, (1, 4, 6)>

So, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
