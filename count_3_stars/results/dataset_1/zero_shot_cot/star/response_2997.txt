Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
