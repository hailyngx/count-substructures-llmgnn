Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Checking each node:  
- Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star.  
- Node 1: Possible 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>  
- Node 2: Possible 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>  
- Node 3: Not a central node of a 3-star.  
- Node 4: Not a central node of a 3-star.  
- Node 5: Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>  
- Node 6: Possible 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>  
- Node 7: Not a central node of a 3-star.  
- Node 8: Not a central node of a 3-star.  
- Node 9: Possible 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>  

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:  
<1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>,  
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>,  
<5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>,  
<6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>,  
<9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>  

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: [17].
