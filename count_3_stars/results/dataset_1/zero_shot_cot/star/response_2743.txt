Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, -)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, -)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
