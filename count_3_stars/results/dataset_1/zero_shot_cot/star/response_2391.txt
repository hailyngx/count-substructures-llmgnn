Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes and their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors (4, 6)
- Node 1: Neighbors (2, 8, 9)
- Node 2: Neighbors (1, 3, 4)
- Node 3: Neighbors (2, 4)
- Node 4: Neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 5: Neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6: Neighbors (0, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 7: Neighbors (5, 6, 8)
- Node 8: Neighbors (1, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: Neighbors (1, 5)

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 1)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
