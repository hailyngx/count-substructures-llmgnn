Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars in this graph:
  
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 6)>
<4, (6, 8, 8)>
<5, (9, 1, 1)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 0)>
<8, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: [9].
