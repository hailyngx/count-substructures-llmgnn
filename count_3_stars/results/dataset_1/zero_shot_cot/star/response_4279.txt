Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:

- Node 0 has 4 edges
- Node 1 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 2 edges
- Node 3 has 1 edge
- Node 4 has 4 edges
- Node 5 has 3 edges
- Node 6 has 2 edges
- Node 7 has 5 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 9 has 4 edges

Now, we will focus on the nodes with exactly 3 edges as those are the potential centers of 3-stars. These nodes are nodes 1, 5, and 8.

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each potential center:
- For node 1: (0, 3, 8)
- For node 5: (4, 7, 7)
- For node 8: (1, 4, 9)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<{1, (0, 3, 8)}> <{5, (4, 7, 7)}> <{8, (1, 4, 9)}>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
