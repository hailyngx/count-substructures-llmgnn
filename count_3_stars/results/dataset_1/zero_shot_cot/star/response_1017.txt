Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first identify all nodes with degree 3:
- Node 0 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 5, 3, 6)
- Node 1 has degree 4, so it's not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 4 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 1, 7, 9)
- Node 5 has degree 4, so it's not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 6 has degree 4, so it's not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 9 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 4, 5, 6)

From the calculations above, we have identified 2 potential 3-stars in the graph involving central nodes 0 and 9.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
