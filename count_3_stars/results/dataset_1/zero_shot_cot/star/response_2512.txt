Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 0)>
<5, (4, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<8, (0, 6, 3)>
<9, (6, 7, 2)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
