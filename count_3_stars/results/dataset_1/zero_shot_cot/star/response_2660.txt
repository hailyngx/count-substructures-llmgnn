Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
- Nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 each have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, find 3-stars centered at them.
- For node 0, (0, 7, 8) is a 3-star.
- For node 2, (2, 3, 5) and (2, 5, 7) are 3-stars.
- For node 5, (5, 2, 7), (5, 4, 6), and (5, 6, 7) are 3-stars.
- For node 6, (6, 1, 8), (6, 5, 8), and (6, 8, 7) are 3-stars.
- For node 7, (7, 0, 8), (7, 2, 5), and (7, 5, 6) are 3-stars.
- For node 8, (8, 0, 6), (8, 6, 7), and (8, 7, 0) are 3-stars.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
- <0, (7, 8)> 
- <2, (3, 5)>
- <2, (5, 7)>
- <5, (2, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6)>
- <5, (6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8)>
- <6, (8, 7)>
- <7, (0, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5)>
- <7, (5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 6)>
