Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Count: [8]
