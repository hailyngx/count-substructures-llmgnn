Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three adjacent edges. These nodes will act as the center of a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 has 3 adjacent edges: (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 9)
2. Node 2 has 3 adjacent edges: (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6)
3. Node 3 has 2 adjacent edges, so it does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 4 has 1 adjacent edge, so it does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 5 has 5 adjacent edges: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8)
6. Node 6 has 1 adjacent edge, so it does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 7 has 1 adjacent edge, so it does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 8 has 4 adjacent edges: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)
9. Node 9 has 1 adjacent edge, so it does not form a 3-star.

Based on the above analysis, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (1, 2, 9)>
<2, (2, 1, 5)>
<5, (5, 0, 2)>
<8, (8, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
