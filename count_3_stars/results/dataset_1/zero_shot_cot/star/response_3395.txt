Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the potential central nodes that could form a 3-star.
- Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Step 2: For each potential central node, check if it has exactly 3 neighbors.
- Central node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Central node 2 has 3 neighbors.
- Central node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Central node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Central node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Central node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Central node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Central node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Central node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
