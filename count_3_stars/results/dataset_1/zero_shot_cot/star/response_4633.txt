Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
