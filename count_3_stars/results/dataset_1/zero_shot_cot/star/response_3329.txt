Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star must have degree 3. Let's identify all nodes with degree 3 in this graph:

- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 4

Thus, the only potential centers of 3-stars are nodes 1, 3, 5, 6. Now, let's check each of these nodes and see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 1: (1, 2, 8) and (1, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 9)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 2)
- Node 6: (6, 3, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (2, 8, 7)>
<3, (0, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 2, -)>
<6, (3, 7, -)>

Counting these 3-stars, we find a total of [4].
