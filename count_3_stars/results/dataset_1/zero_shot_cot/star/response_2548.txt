Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The center node and its neighboring nodes can form multiple 3-stars. Let's count them one by one:

1. For node 0: 
   <0, (5, 7, 9)>
2. For node 1:
   <1, (4, 5, 7)> 
3. For node 2:
   <2, (3, 6, 9)>
4. For node 3:
   <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. For node 4:
   <4, (1, 3, 9)>
6. For node 5:
   <5, (0, 1, 8)>
7. For node 9:
   <9, (0, 1, 2)>
