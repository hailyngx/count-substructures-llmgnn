Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
