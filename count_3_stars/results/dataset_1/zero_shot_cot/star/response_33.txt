Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes 1, 3, and 6: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes 1, 4, and 8: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes 3, 6, and 9: <2, (3, 6, 9)>
4. Node 2 forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes 1, 8, and 9: <2, (1, 8, 9)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes 2, 5, and 7: <3, (2, 5, 7)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes 2, 4, and 9: <8, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
