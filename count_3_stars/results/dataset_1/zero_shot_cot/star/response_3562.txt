Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and the corresponding leaves. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 2)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 7)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars shown above: [9]
