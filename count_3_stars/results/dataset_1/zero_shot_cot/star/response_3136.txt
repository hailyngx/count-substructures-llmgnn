Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9: <3, (4, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9: <4, (3, 8, 9)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4: <8, (2, 3, 4)>
7. Node 9 forms 4 different 3-stars: 
   - <9, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <9, (3, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (5, 8, 9)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
Therefore, the answer is [7].
