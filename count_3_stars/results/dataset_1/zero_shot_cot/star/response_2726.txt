Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <6, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <6, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <6, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
