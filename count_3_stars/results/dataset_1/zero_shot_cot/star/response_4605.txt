Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star.

Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 9: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
3. Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to two other nodes.
5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to one other node.
6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to two other nodes.
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to two other nodes.
8. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to three other nodes, forming a triangle instead.
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to three other nodes, forming a triangle instead.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
