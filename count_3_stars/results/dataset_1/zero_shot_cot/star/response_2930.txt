Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9.
   - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 9)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
   - <2, (4, 5, 0)>

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
   - <5, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <5, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (2, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (4, 8, 9)>
   - <5, (6, 8, 9)>

4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
   - <8, (5, 7, 9)>

5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
   - <9, (0, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [15]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 0)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
