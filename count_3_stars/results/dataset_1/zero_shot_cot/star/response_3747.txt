Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node as the potential center of the star.

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9. Since 0 is connected to exactly 3 nodes, there is one 3-star <0, (1, 5, 6)>.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since 1 is connected to exactly 3 nodes, there is one 3-star <1, (0, 2, 5)>.

Continuing similarly for nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
- For node 2:  <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- For node 3:  No 3-stars.
- For node 4:  <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- For node 5:  <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- For node 6:  <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- For node 7:  <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- For node 8:  No 3-stars.
- For node 9:  No 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
<0, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>
