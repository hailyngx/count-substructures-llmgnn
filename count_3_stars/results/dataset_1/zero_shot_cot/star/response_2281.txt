Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: (0, 3, 5, 7) -> <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- For node 1: (1, 3, 6, 7) -> <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- For node 4: (4, 2, 5, 6), (4, 3, 7, 8) -> <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- For node 7: (7, 0, 1, 8) -> <7, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
