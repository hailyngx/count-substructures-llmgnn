Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. Then, we will form 3-stars by considering each center node and its three adjacent nodes.

Here are the steps we will follow:
1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes.
2. For each of these identified nodes, list the neighboring nodes to form unique 3-stars.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.

2. Unique 3-stars:
   <2, (3, 7, 8)>
   <3, (2, 4, 7)>
   <4, (1, 3, 5)>
   <8, (2, 4, 8)>

3. Total number of unique 3-stars: [4]

So, the final answer (number of 3-stars in the given graph, represented in brackets) is [4].
