Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 9)
   - Possible 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 9)>

2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 8)
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to 2 nodes.

3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 8)
   - Possible 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 8)>

4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6)
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 nodes.

5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
   - Possible 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 7)>

6. Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
   - Possible 3-star: <5, (4, 6, 7)>

7. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7)
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 nodes.

8. Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8)
   - Possible 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 8)>

9. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   - Possible 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 5)>

10. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8)
   - No 3-star as it is only connected to 3 nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, and <8, (1, 4, 5)>.

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
