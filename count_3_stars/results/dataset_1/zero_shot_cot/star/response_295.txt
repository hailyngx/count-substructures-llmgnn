Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3 node) by exactly one edge to form the leaves of the 3-star.

In this graph, the nodes and their connections to other nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: Connected to 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: Connected to 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: Connected to 4, 9
- Node 3: Connected to 5
- Node 4: Connected to 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: Connected to 0, 1, 3
- Node 6: Connected to 4
- Node 7: Connected to 1
- Node 8: Connected to 0
- Node 9: Connected to 1, 2, 4

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Central node 0: <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- Central node 1: <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- Central node 2: <2, (4, 9)>
- Central node 4: <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- Central node 5: <5, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<2, (4, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 3)>.
