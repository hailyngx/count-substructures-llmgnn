Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in this given graph. 

Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

In this graph, nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9 have exactly three neighbors each. Let's list the 3-star graphs they form:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
