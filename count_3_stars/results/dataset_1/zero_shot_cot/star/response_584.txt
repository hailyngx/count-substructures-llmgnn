Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph and list them, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Let's first consider each node one by one and check if it is the central node of a 3-star. 

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. Forms one 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>.

2. Node 2: Connected to node 6. Not a central node of any 3-star.

3. Node 3: Connected to nodes 0 and 6. Forms one 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 0)>.

4. Node 4: Connected to node 0. Not a central node of any 3-star.

5. Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 8. Not a central node of any 3-star.

6. Node 6: Connected to nodes 2 and 3. Not a central node of any 3-star.

7. Node 7: Connected to node 9. Not a central node of any 3-star.

8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 5 and 9. Not a central node of any 3-star.

9. Node 9: Connected to nodes 7 and 8. Not a central node of any 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-star found in the graph is <0, (3, 4, 5)>. 

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
