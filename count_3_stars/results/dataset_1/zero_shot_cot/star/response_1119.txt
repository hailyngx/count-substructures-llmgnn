Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, they will form a pattern like <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Given the edges provided, we need to identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Then, we can list the unique 3-stars formed by considering these nodes as the central node.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has three edges connected to it: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 9)
   <0, (1, 4, 9)>

2. Node 7 has six edges connected to it: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (7, 0)
   Since node 7 has more than three edges, we cannot form a 3-star centered at node 7.

3. Node 8 has three edges connected to it: (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   <8, (5, 7, 9)>

4. Node 9 has three edges connected to it: (9, 0), (9, 7), (9, 8)
   <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
