Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (1, 3, 4), it forms a 3-star. Therefore, <0, (1, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 2, 3), it forms a 3-star. Therefore, <1, (0, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (1, 4, 5), it forms a 3-star. Therefore, <2, (1, 4, 5)> is a 3-star.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 1, 4), it forms a 3-star. Therefore, <3, (0, 1, 4)> is a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 7. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 1, 3), it forms a 3-star. Therefore, <4, (0, 1, 3)> is a 3-star.

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 1, 2), it forms a 3-star. Therefore, <6, (0, 1, 2)> is a 3-star.

7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (3, 6, 9), it forms a 3-star. Therefore, <8, (3, 6, 9)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
