Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 8 and 9, forming a 3-star: <0, (8, 9)>
2. Node 1 has edges with nodes 2, 3, and 9, forming a 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 9)>
3. Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 5, and 6, forming a 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
4. Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 6, and 7, forming a 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. Node 5 has edges with nodes 2 and 9, but it does not form a 3-star since it does not have the required 3 edges.
6. Node 6 has edges with nodes 2, 3, and 7, forming a 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 7)>
7. Node 7 has edges with nodes 2, 3, and 6, forming a 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 6)>
8. Node 8 has edges with nodes 0, 6, and 7, forming a 3-star: <8, (0, 6, 7)>
9. Node 9 has edges with nodes 0, 1, and 5, forming a 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 5)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
