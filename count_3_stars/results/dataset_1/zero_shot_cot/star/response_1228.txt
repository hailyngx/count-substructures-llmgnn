Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. From node 0: <0, (7, 8, 0)>
2. From node 1: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
3. From node 3: <3, (5, 6, 7)>
4. From node 4: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
5. From node 7: <7, (0, 1, 3)>
6. From node 9: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of 6.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
