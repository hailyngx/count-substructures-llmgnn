Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8. Hence, <0, (1, 3, 8)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9. Hence, <1, (0, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6. Hence, <5, (2, 3, 6)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6. Hence, <7, (1, 2, 6)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8. Hence, <9, (1, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
<0, (1, 3, 8)><1, (0, 7, 9)><5, (2, 3, 6)><7, (1, 2, 6)><9, (1, 5, 8)>
