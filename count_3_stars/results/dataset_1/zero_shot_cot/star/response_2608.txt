Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected in a star pattern with a central node. 

First, let's list all the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
