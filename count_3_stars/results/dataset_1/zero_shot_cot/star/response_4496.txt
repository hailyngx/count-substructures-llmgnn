Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<[0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>]
