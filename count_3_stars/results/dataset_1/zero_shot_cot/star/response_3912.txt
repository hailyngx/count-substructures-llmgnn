Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0. These are nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9. 

Now, we will check which of these nodes are connected to exactly two other nodes, forming a 3-star with the center at node 0. 

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

Therefore, the unique 3-star configurations in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
