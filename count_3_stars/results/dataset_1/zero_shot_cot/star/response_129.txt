Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes connected to each node to visualize the 3-stars.

Node 0: 1, 3, 8  
Node 1: 0  
Node 2: 3  
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8  
Node 4: 3, 6, 8  
Node 5: 3, 6  
Node 6: 4, 5, 9  
Node 7: 9  
Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9  
Node 9: 6, 7, 8  

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:  
<0, (1, 3, 8)>  
<3, (0, 2, 4)>  
<3, (0, 4, 5)>  
<3, (2, 4, 5)>  
<3, (4, 5, 8)>  
<4, (3, 6, 8)>  
<5, (3, 6, 9)>  
<6, (4, 5, 9)>  
<8, (0, 4, 9)>  
<9, (6, 7, 8)>  

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
