Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with three edges connected (degree 3 nodes).
Vertices with degree 3: 0, 5, 7.

Step 2: For each degree 3 node, identify the adjacent nodes.
For node 0: Adjacent nodes are 3, 8.
For node 5: Adjacent nodes are 1, 2, 8.
For node 7: Adjacent nodes are 6, 8, 9.

Step 3: Check if the adjacent nodes form 3-stars with the degree 3 node.
For node 0: (0, 3, 8), (0, 8, 5) are 3-stars. 
For node 5: (5, 1, 8), (5, 2, 8) are 3-stars.
For node 7: (7, 6, 8) is a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 2)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
