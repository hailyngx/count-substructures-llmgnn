Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 7)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (8, 9, 4)>
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
5. Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>
6. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (6, 8, 4)>
7. Node 8: <8, (3, 6, 7)>
8. Node 9: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
