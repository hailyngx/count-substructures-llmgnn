Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

These nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star.

For node 0:
- not a 3-star because it has 4 connections: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8)

For node 1:
- not a 3-star because it has 2 connections: (1, 5), (1, 7)

For node 3:
- not a 3-star because it has 3 connections but they don't form a 3-star: (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)

For node 4:
- not a 3-star because it has 2 connections: (4, 0), (4, 8)

For node 6:
- not a 3-star because it has 2 connections: (6, 0), (6, 5)

Step 3: List all unique 3-stars found.

There are no 3-stars in the given graph.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
