Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in a 3-star pattern. In this case, we need to find nodes that are connected to a specific node by exactly two edges. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 satisfy this condition.

Next, we need to check for each of these nodes, how many other nodes they are connected to besides the center node. If a node is connected to exactly two other nodes besides the center, then we have a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:
- Node 2: (2, 3) (2, 6) -> Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 3: (3, 2) (3, 6) -> Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 4: (4, 5) (4, 7) -> Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 5: (5, 4) (5, 7) -> Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 6: (6, 2) (6, 3) -> Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 7: (7, 1) (7, 4) -> Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to more than two nodes.

So, we have found a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <2, (3, 6)>, <3, (2, 6)>, <4, (5, 7)>, and <5, (4, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
