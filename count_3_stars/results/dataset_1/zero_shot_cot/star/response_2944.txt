Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can see that the possible 3-star configurations are:
1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <1, (2, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
