Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Looking at the edges given, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0,)>
<5, (0, 9)>
<6, (0, 1)>
<7, (1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: 9
