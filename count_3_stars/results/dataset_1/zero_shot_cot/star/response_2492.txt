Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the 3-stars and then count them.

List of 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
