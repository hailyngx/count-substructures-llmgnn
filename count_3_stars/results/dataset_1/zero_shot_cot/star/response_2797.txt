Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (2, 5, -)>  
<2, (0, 1, 3)>  
<5, (0, 4, 8)>  
<8, (2, 5, -)>  

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
