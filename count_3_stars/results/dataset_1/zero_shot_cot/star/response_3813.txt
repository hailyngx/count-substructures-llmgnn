Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star by checking the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
From the node degrees, we can see that nodes 0, 6, 5, and 9 are part of at least one 3-star. 

To find the number of 3-stars, we can count the total number of edges between these nodes:
- (0, 1, 5)
- (0, 5, 9)
- (0, 1, 9)
- (5, 4, 9)

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 4)>
