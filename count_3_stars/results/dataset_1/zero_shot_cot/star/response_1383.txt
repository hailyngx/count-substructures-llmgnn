Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star pattern with their connected nodes.

Let's go through these steps:

1. Nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.

2. Checking for 3-star patterns:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
   - Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <2, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, and <2, (1, 4, 6)>.
