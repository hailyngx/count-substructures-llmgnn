Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's list out all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, -)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (2, 8, 3)>
<6, (3, -, -)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, -)>
<9, (3, 5, -)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find a total of 9 3-stars in the graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
