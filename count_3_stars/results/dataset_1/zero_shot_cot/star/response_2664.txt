Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 8, -)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, -)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[10]
