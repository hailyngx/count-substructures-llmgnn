Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
From the given edges, we can identify the central nodes as nodes: 3, 5, and 6.

Next, let's find the 3-star configurations for each central node:
For central node 3:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 2, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>

For central node 5:
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 1)>

For central node 6:
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 3, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
