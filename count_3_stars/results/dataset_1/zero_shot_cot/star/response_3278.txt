Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's focus on identifying the 3-star structures:

1. Node 0: (1, 7, 2) and (1, 7, 8)
2. Node 1: (4, 6, 7) and (4, 6, 8)
3. Node 2: (8, 4, 9)
4. Node 3: (4, 6, 9)
5. Node 4: (1, 3, 8) and (1, 3, 6)
6. Node 5: None (not a central node of any 3-star)
7. Node 6: (1, 3, 8) and (1, 3, 4) and (3, 9, 4)
8. Node 7: (1, 4, 8) and (1, 4, 6)
9. Node 8: (2, 4, 6)
10. Node 9: (2, 3, 4) and (3, 4, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [14]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 2)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (8, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 9, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
