Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to node 1, since node 1 will be the center of each 3-star.  
Based on the given edges, the nodes directly connected to node 1 are: 0, 5, 7. 

Now, for each node directly connected to node 1, we need to identify which other nodes they are connected to.  
For node 0: 
- Node 0 is connected to node 1  
However, this configuration does not create a 3-star since node 1 is the center.

For node 5: 
- Node 5 is connected to node 1 

For node 7: 
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 3

The possible 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (7, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 7)>.
