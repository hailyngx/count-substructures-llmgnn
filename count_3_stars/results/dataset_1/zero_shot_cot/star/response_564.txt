Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The possible 3-stars in the graph can have the following central nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's go through each central node and check their connections to determine the 3-stars.

For central node 0: Leaves connected are 2, 5, 9.
For central node 1: Leaves connected are 4, 5, 7.
For central node 2: Leaves connected are 0, 8, X (No third leaf connected).
For central node 3: Leaves connected are 4, 6, 8.
For central node 4: Leaves connected are 1, 3, 5.
For central node 5: Leaves connected are 0, 1, 4.
For central node 6: Leaves connected are 3, X, X (No other leaves connected).
For central node 7: Leaves connected are 1, X, X (No other leaves connected).
For central node 8: Leaves connected are 0, 2, 3.
For central node 9: Leaves connected are 0, 5, 8.

So, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
