Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the 3-stars in this graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, then it forms a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, -)>
<3, (0, 5, -)>
<4, (1, 7, -)>
<5, (3, 8, -)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
