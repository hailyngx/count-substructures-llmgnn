Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node in each 3-star. 

For each node, we will check if they have exactly 3 neighbors, i.e., they are part of a 3-star.

The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9. It forms a 3-star <0, (2, 3, 4)> and <0, (2, 4, 9)>.
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 5. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9. It forms a 3-star <2, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 3 has neighbor: 0. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbor: 0. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 6, 9. It forms a 3-star <5, (1, 6, 9)>.
- Node 6 has neighbor: 5. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbor: 6. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 9. It does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 8. It forms a 3-star <9, (0, 2, 5)>.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
