Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and the leaves connected to it for each 3-star in the graph.

```plaintext
Central node: Leaves
0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
1: 3, 5, 6, 8
2: 0, 5, 7
3: 1, 6
4: 0, 6, 8
5: 0, 1, 2, 7
6: 0, 1, 3, 4
7: 2, 5
8: 1, 4
9: 0
```

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 

```plaintext
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
```

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
