Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a 3-star structure.

By observing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3,6,7)>
<1, (4,7,9)>
<2, (5,6,9)>
<3, (0,8,9)>
<4, (1,6,7)>
<5, (2,6,9)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
