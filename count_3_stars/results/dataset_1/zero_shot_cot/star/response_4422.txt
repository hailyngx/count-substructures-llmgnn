Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (4)>
<3, (5, 9)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Since each 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
