Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the highest degree in the graph, as the central nodes of potential 3-stars. 

The nodes with the highest degree are: 
- Node 1 with degree 6
- Node 9 with degree 6
- Node 8 with degree 5

Next, let's look for 3-stars where the center node has degree 6. 

Checking Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8, 9, 7
- The potential 3-stars starting from Node 1 are: 
  - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (6, 0, 7)>
  [Number of 3-stars from Node 1: 3]

Checking Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- The potential 3-star starting from Node 9 is: 
  - <9, (1, 2, 3)>
  [Number of 3-stars from Node 9: 1]

Checking Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- The potential 3-stars starting from Node 8 are: 
  - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <8, (7, 3, 9)>
  - <8, (9, 1, 4)>
  [Number of 3-stars from Node 8: 5]

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 0, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (7, 3, 9)>, <8, (9, 1, 4)>
