Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Starting from node 0: (0, 4, 5, 7).
- Moving to node 1: (1, 2, 3, 7).
- Next, look at node 2: (2, 1, 8).
- Checking node 3: (3, 1, 4, 5, 6).
- No 3-stars can be formed from nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 8)>
