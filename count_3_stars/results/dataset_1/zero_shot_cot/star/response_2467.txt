Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and the corresponding leaves in each 3-star. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, -)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
