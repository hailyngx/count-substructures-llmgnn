Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>

Now, we count the unique 3-stars:
[9]
