Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 8, -)>
5. <4, (5, -, -)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
8. <7, (6, 9, -)>
9. <8, (3, 5, -)>
10. <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we get a total of [10].
