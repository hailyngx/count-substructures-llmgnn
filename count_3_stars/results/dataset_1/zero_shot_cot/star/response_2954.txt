Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
7. <9, (0, 1, )>  (Note: Node 9 is the center with only 2 leaves 0 and 1.)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
