Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to only three other nodes, we can identify them by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 7, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, -)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
