Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with degree 3.
Nodes with degree 3: 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, check if it forms a 3-star.
For node 2:
Looking at its neighbors (1, 5, 7, 9), it forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 7)>

For node 5:
Looking at its neighbors (0, 1, 2, 7, 8), it forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 2)>

For node 7:
Looking at its neighbors (2, 5, 6, 9), it forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 5, 9)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
Total 3-stars: 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
