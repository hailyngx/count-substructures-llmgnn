Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the provided edges, the nodes in the graph with connections to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph with the identified central nodes:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. (<>).
