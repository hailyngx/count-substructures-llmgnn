Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

In this graph, nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 each have three edges connected to them, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, we can construct the 3-stars:
- For node 2: <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- For node 3: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- For node 4: <4, (3, 9, -)>
- For node 5: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- For node 9: <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
