Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's go step by step: 

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Since it's connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we have a 3-star centered at node 0. 
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. Since it's connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we have another 3-star centered at node 3. 
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9. Since it's connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we have one more 3-star centered at node 4.

2. List the 3-stars found:
   - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
