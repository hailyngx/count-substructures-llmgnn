Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Essentially, we will look for nodes with exactly three neighbors and then check if they form 3-stars.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 0, Node 1, Node 6, Node 8

2. For each node identified in step 1, check if they form 3-stars:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 5)
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with (0, 3, 7)
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with (3, 7, 9)
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star with (2, 3, 9)

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
