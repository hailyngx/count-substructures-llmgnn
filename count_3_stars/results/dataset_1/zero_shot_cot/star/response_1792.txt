Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by following the definition of a 3-star graph.

Focusing on each node, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 7: No 3-star, as it only has one edge connecting it to node 4.
- Node 8: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars identified, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
