Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (7, 9, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 3)>
<4, (3, 7, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 9, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 8, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
