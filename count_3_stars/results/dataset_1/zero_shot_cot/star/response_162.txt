Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
