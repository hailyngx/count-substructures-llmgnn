Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. However, since we are looking for 3-stars where the center is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can exclude node 0 from being a part of any 3-star.

2. Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9 are also connected to more than 3 other nodes, so they cannot be centers of 3-stars.

3. Nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7 are the only nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes. We will check the possible 3-stars with these nodes.

Based on the given edges, the list of unique 3-stars in this graph is:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 0, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 0, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 1)>
<6, (0, 7, 2)>
<7, (0, 5, 2)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<7, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 0)>
<7, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
