Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
We will look for all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6)
    <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    
2. Node 1:
    - No 3-stars as it does not have enough edges.
    
3. Node 2:
    - (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)
    <2, (0, 1, 3)> 
    <2, (0, 5, 7)>
    <2, (1, 3, 5)> 
    <2, (1, 3, 7)>
    <2, (5, 7, 8)>
    <2, (5, 7, 9)>
    <2, (7, 8, 9)>
    
4. Node 3:
    - (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8)
    <3, (0, 2, 6)> 
    <3, (0, 2, 8)>
    
5. Node 4:
    - (4, 6), (4, 9)
    <4, (6, 9)>
    
6. Node 5:
    - (5, 2), (5, 7)
    <5, (2, 7)>
    
7. Node 6:
    - (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4)
    <6, (0, 3, 4)>
    
8. Node 7:
    - (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9)
    <7, (2, 5, 8)>
    <7, (2, 5, 9)>
    <7, (5, 8, 9)>
    
9. Node 8:
    - (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7)
    <8, (2, 3, 7)>
    
10. Node 9:
    - (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 7)
    <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
