Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern. Let's go step by step to identify the 3-stars and then count them.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
