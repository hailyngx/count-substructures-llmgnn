Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences of 3-stars.

Let's first list the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars from the given graph:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 0)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
