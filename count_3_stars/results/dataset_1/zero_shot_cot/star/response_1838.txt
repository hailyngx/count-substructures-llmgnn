Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
In this graph, the 3-star structures can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, -)>
<5, (3, -, -)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, -, -)>

Counting these, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
