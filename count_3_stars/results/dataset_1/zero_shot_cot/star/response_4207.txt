Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (7, 3, 8)>
<2, (8, 3, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
