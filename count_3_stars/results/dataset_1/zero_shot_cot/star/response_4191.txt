Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the given edges to find all 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to node 4.
2. Node 1 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to nodes 4 and 9, not forming a 3-star configuration.
3. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to nodes 5 and 6, not forming a 3-star configuration.
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
5. Node 4 is already considered in the 3-star <3, (4, 5, 7)> above.
6. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to more than three nodes.
7. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to node 2.
8. Node 7 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to more than three nodes.
9. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to more than three nodes.
10. Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it is connected to nodes 1 and 5, not forming a 3-star configuration.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
