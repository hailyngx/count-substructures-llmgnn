Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Looking at node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 3, 4, and 7 as leaves. <1, (3, 4, 7)>

2. Looking at node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4. However, it is not forming a 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

3. Looking at node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9. To find the 3-stars, we will consider the unique subsets of nodes that are connected to node 4. 
    - The subsets that form 3-stars are:
        a. <4, (1, 3, 6)>
        b. <4, (1, 3, 9)>

4. Looking at node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. However, it is not forming a 3-star as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.

5. Looking at node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to node 1. However, it is not forming a 3-star as it is connected to only 1 other node.

6. Looking at node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to node 6. However, it is not forming a 3-star as it is connected to only 1 other node.

7. Looking at node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to node 4. However, it is not forming a 3-star as it is connected to only 1 other node.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
