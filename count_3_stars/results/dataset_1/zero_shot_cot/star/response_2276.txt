Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, -)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
