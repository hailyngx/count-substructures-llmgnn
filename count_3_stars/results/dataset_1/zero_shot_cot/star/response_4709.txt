Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
3. Node 2: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 4)> and <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. Node 4: No 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to only one node.
7. Node 6: <6, (1, 5, 8)>
8. Node 7: No 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
10. Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)> and <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
