Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:

- Central Node 0: Connected to nodes 2 and 8
- Central Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Central Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Central Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8
- Central Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6
- Central Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9
- Central Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9
- Central Node 7: Connected to nodes 2 and 8
- Central Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Central Node 9: Connected to nodes 5 and 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 8)>  
<1, (3, 4, 5)>  
<2, (0, 3, 7)>  
<3, (1, 2, 4)>  
<4, (1, 3, 5)>  
<5, (1, 4, 9)>  
<6, (3, 4, 9)>  
<7, (2, 8)>  
<8, (0, 3, 7)>  
<9, (5, 6)>  
  
There are [10] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
