Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 1, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 3)>
<2, (3, 8, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
