Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every pair of nodes that share a common neighbor. These pairs of nodes, along with the common neighbor, form a 3-star. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 9, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
