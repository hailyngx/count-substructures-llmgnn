Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, as these nodes can be the centers of 3-stars. Based on the provided edges:

- Node 0 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 2 has 2 edges connected to it.
- Node 3 has 1 edge connected to it.
- Node 4 has 1 edge connected to it.
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected to it.
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 8 has 1 edge connected to it.
- Node 9 has 2 edges connected to it.

Therefore, nodes 1, 6, and 7 are the potential central nodes of 3-stars as they have exactly three edges connected to them.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 1:
    - <1, (0, 7, 9)>
    
2. For node 6:
    - <6, (0, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (0, 7, 9)>
    
3. For node 7:
    - <7, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <7, (1, 0, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
