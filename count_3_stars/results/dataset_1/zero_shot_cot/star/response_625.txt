Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's write them down step by step.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
   <0, (1, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.
   <1, (0, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
   <2, (0, 8,  )> is not a 3-star.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9.
   <3, (0, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
   <4, (0, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
   <5, (0, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
   <6, (1, 3,  )> is not a 3-star.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   <8, (1, 2, 4)> is not a 3-star.

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
   <9, (1, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
