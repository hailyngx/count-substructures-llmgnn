Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the possible 3-stars based on the given edges:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 3, -)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, -)>
<9, (0, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
