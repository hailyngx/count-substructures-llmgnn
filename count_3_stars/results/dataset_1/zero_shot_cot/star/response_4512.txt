Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (center nodes). Then we can check the neighbors of each center node to see if they form a 3-star.

Potential center nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Checking for 3-stars:
- Center node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 6), (0, 3, 7)
- Center node 1: (1, 0, 2)
- Center node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 3, 5), (2, 6, 8)
- Center node 3: (3, 0, 9)
- No 3-star for center node 4
- No 3-star for center node 5
- Center node 6: (6, 0, 7)
- Center node 7: (7, 0, 6)
- Center node 8: (8, 1, 2), (8, 9, 3)
- Center node 9: (9, 3, 8)

Therefore, we have found the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 0)>, <2, (3, 5, 2)>, <2, (6, 8, 2)>, <3, (9, 8, 3)>

This gives us a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
