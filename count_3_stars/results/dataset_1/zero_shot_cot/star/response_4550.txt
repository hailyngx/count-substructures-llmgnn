Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For each node, determine if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star is formed if the center has exactly 3 edges and the nodes connected to it share no other edges.
- Count the number of unique 3-stars. 

After analyzing the graph, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
