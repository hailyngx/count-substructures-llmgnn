Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible 3-star configuration where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
