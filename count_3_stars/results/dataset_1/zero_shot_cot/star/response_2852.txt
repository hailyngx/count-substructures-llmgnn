Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (7, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, -)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
