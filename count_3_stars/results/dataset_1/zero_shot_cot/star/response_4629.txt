Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the list of edges, we can see the following connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[The number of 3-stars: 2]

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
