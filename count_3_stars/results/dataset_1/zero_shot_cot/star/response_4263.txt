Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to node 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
