Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

In this graph, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 7, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
