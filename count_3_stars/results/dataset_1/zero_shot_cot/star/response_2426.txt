Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with 3 connections:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and no other nodes.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and no other nodes.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and no other nodes.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and no other nodes.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, no other nodes.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - We have a total of 3-stars: [4].

3. List the unique 3-stars: 
   - <0, (1, 3, -)>
   - <1, (0, 9, -)>
   - <2, (5, 9, -)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 5)>
