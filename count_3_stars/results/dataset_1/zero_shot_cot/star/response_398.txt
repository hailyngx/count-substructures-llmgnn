Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 6)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 2)
4. Node 4: (4, 5, 7)

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
    
<[0, (3, 5)]> 
<[1, (3, 6)]>
<[3, (0, 2)]>
<[4, (5, 7)]>
