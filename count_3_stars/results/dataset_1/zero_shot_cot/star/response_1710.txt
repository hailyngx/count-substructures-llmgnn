Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 1, node 2, and node 9, as these can potentially form 3-stars.

For Node 1:
- Connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9

For Node 2:
- Connected to nodes 1 and 9

For Node 9:
- Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6

Now, we can list out the 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
