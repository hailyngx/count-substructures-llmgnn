Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the edges given:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to node 0
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 4
- Node 8 is connected to node 2
- Node 9 is connected to node 3

From the above connections, the only unique 3-stars we can find are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. So the final answer is [3].
