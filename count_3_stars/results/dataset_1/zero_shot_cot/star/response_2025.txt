Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars with a central node.

Let's consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and check its connections:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6) -> Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6.
2. Node 1: (1, 4) -> Cannot form a 3-star.
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8) -> Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 5, and 6.
4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 5) -> Cannot form a 3-star.
5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 6) -> Cannot form a 3-star.
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7) -> Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3.
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8) -> Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 4; and nodes 2, 4, and 7.
8. Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 6) -> Cannot form a 3-star.
9. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 9) -> Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9: (9, 8) -> Cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, and <8, (2, 6, 9)>.

Count of 3-stars: [5].
