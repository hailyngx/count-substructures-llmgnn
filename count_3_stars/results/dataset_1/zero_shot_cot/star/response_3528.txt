Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 3 has neighbors 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 5, and 6.

Step 2: List the unique 3-stars:
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
