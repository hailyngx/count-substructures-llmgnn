Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. 
- Node 0 has 5 edges connected to it. 
- Node 1 has 2 edges connected to it. 
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it. 
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it. 
- Node 4 has 1 edge connected to it. 
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected to it. 
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it. 
- Node 7 has 2 edges connected to it. 
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it. 
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it.

Step 2: Identify potential 3-star combinations. 
- Nodes 1, 2, and 7 can form a 3-star centered at Node 2. (1, 2, 7).
- Nodes 5, 6, and 8 can form a 3-star centered at Node 6. (5, 6, 8).

Output the final answer inside brackets: [2]
List the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once: <<1, 2, 7>, <5, 6, 8>>
