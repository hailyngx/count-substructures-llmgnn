Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to 3 nodes (1, 2, 5)
- Node 1: Connected to 4 nodes (0, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 2: Connected to 2 nodes (0, 4)
- Node 3: Connected to 1 node (5)
- Node 4: Connected to 5 nodes (1, 2, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: Connected to 5 nodes (0, 3, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6: Connected to 2 nodes (4, 5)
- Node 7: Connected to 4 nodes (1, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 8: Connected to 4 nodes (1, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 9: Connected to 2 nodes (4, 8)

2. Counting the number of 3-stars:
- We need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking at nodes that are connected to three other nodes.
- Let's list down the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

3. Final Count:
