Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
First, we identify the center nodes and then find their neighboring nodes. 

1. Center node: 0
   Neighboring nodes: 1, 2, 5, 9
   <0, (1, 2, 5)>
   <0, (1, 2, 9)>
   <0, (1, 5, 9)>
   <0, (2, 5, 9)>

2. Center node: 1
   Neighboring nodes: 0, 2, 3, 5
   <1, (0, 2, 5)>
   <1, (0, 2, 9)>
   <1, (0, 3, 5)>
   <1, (2, 3, 5)>

3. Center node: 2
   Neighboring nodes: 0, 1, 7, 9
   <2, (0, 1, 7)>
   <2, (0, 1, 9)>
   <2, (1, 7, 9)>
   <2, (0, 7, 9)>

4. Center node: 5
   Neighboring nodes: 0, 1, 7
   <5, (0, 1, 7)>

Since all of the 3-stars have been identified, counting them gives us a total of [11].
