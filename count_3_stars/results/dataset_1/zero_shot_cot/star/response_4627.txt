Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. We can then count the 3-stars based on this information.

The central node and its adjacent nodes are as follows:
- Central node: 0
- Adjacent nodes: 2, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. 3-star with central node 0: (0, 2, 4, 6), (0, 2, 6, 8), (0, 4, 6, 8) [3]
2. 3-star with central node 1: (1, 4, 5, 6) [1]
3. 3-star with central node 2: (2, 0, 4, 6), (2, 0, 6, 8), (2, 4, 6, 8) [3]
4. 3-star with central node 3: (3, 5, 6, 9) [1]
5. 3-star with central node 4: (4, 0, 2, 6), (4, 0, 6, 8), (4, 1, 6, 8) [3]
6. 3-star with central node 5: (5, 1, 3, 8) [1]
7. 3-star with central node 6: (6, 0, 2, 4), (6, 0, 4, 8), (6, 1, 4, 5), (6, 3, 5, 9) [4]
8. 3-star with central node 8: (8, 0, 2, 4), (8, 0, 4, 6), (8, 1, 4, 5) [3]
9. 3-star with central node 9: (9, 1, 2, 3) [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1] = [20].

Unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>

<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>

<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
