Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node of each 3-star by looking for nodes with exactly 3 edges.  
In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7 have exactly 3 edges, which makes them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Step 2: For each potential central node, identify the connected nodes to form a 3-star pattern.  
Using the potential central nodes:
1. For node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9) -> <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. For node 1: (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9) -> <1, (4, 7, 9)>
3. For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8) -> <5, (0, 3, 8)>
4. For node 7: (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9) -> <7, (1, 3, 4)> and <7, (8, 9, 3)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.   
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, and <7, (8, 9, 3)>.  
Thus, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
