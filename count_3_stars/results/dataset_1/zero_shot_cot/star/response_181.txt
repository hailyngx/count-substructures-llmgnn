Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. We have 10 unique 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
