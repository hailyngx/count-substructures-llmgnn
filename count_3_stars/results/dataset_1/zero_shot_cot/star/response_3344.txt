Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided.

We can start by listing all nodes that have exactly three adjacent nodes. These nodes have the potential to be the centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 adjacent nodes:
- Node 1: (0, 4, 5)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 5)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 3)
- Node 5: (1, 3, 6)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 7)

Now, we can construct the 3-stars using these potential centers:
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
[<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>]
