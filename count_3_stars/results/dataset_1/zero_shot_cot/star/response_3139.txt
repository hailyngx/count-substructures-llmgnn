Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list out all the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1 is connected to node 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6
- Node 5 is connected to node 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, and <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
