Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's break down the process step-by-step:

1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes:
    - Central Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5)
    - Central Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)
    - Central Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4)
    - Central Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8)
    - Central Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
    - Central Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 8)
    - Central Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8)
    - Central Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 8)
    - Central Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)
    - Central Node 9: (9, 1)

2. Identify the 3-star configurations:
    - Central Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes (1, 4, 5)
    - Central Node 1 can form 3-stars with nodes (0, 3, 6), (0, 7, 8), (0, 8, 9)
    - Central Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 4)
    - Central Node 4 can form 3-stars with nodes (0, 2, 3)
    - Central Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes (1, 7, 8)
    - Central Node 8 can form 3-stars with nodes (1, 3, 5), (1, 6, 7)

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars:
    - There are 1 unique 3-star for Central Node 0.
    - There are 3 unique 3-stars for Central Node 1.
    - There is 1 unique 3-star for Central Node 3.
    - There are 2 unique 3-stars for Central Node 4.
    - There is 1 unique 3-star for Central Node 6.
    - There are 2 unique 3-stars for Central Node 8.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
