Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes for each 3-star. We are given that each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
4. <1, (3, 7, 2)>
5. <2, (8, 9, 1)>
6. <3, (0, 5, 1)>
7. <3, (0, 5, 8)>
8. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
9. <5, (3, 4, 8)>
10. <5, (3, 8, 9)>
11. <6, (0, 9, 7)>
12. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
13. <8, (5, 2, 9)>
14. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
