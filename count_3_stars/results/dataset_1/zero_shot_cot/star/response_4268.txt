Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<0, (7, 5, 9)>
<0, (8, 5, 7)>
<0, (9, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 6)>
<2, (6, 1, 6)>
<2, (6, 3, 9)>
<3, (6, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 0, 8)>
<5, (7, 0, 9)>
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 6, 2)>
<6, (2, 1, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 0, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [30].
