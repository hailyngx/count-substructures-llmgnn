Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   - By observing the connections of nodes 4 and 8, we see that these connections do not form a 3-star with node 0.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
   - Nodes 2 and 5 are connected to each other but not with node 1, so this does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - Nodes 1 and 5 are connected to each other but not with node 2, so this does not form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
   - This connection forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 8, 9)>.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
   - This connection forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
   - There is already a 3-star with node 3 as the center.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
     - This connection forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 9)>.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
   - We already identified this connection as a 3-star.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
   - Node 0 is already part of a 3-star.
   - Node 3 is already part of a 3-star.

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
   - We already identified connections with nodes 3, 4, and 7 forming 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, and <7, (4, 5, 9)>.

Count of 3-stars: [3]

<3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>
