Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 

1. 3-star centered at node 1: (1, 4), (1, 7)
2. 3-star centered at node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8)
3. 3-star centered at node 3: (3, 2), (3, 9)
4. 3-star centered at node 4: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6)
5. 3-star centered at node 8: (8, 2), (8, 9)
6. 3-star centered at node 9: (9, 3), (9, 8)

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get: <1, (4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (2, 9)>, <9, (3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
