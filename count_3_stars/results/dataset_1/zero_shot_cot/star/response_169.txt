Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges with the connections provided, we can find the 3-stars by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 3, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star <0, (3, 5, 7)>.
2. Node 1 does not form a 3-star as it has only one connection.
3. Node 2 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 6, forming a 3-star <2, (3, 4, 6)>.
4. Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 7)> and <3, (2, 5, 7)>.
5. Node 4 has connections with nodes 2, 7, and 8, forming a 3-star <4, (2, 7, 8)>.
6. Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (0, 7, 8)> and <5, (3, 7, 8)>.
7. Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 8, 9)> and <6, (2, 8, 9)>.
8. Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 5)> and <7, (3, 4, 5)>.
9. Node 8 forms two 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 6)> and <8, (6, 7, 5)>.
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has only one connection.

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (6, 7, 5)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
