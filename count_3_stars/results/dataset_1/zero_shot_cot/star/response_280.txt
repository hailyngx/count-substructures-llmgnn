Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars given above, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in total.
