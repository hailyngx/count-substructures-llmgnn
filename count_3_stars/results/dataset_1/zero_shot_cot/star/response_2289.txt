Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.  

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.  

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:  
<0, (4, 5, 9)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>  
<4, (0, 5, 8)>  
<5, (0, 3, 4)>  
<8, (4, 7, 9)>  
<9, (1, 4, 8)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>  
<4, (0, 5, 8)>  
<5, (0, 3, 4)>  
<8, (4, 7, 9)>  
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
