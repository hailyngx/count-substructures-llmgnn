Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
