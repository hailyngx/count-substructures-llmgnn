Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- There are two 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 5)> and <1, (3, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
