Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 7)>
4. <4, (0, 8, 9)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <5, (0, 9, 5)>
7. <7, (4, 8, 9)>
8. <8, (4, 7, 9)>
9. <9, (3, 5, 7)>
10. <9, (4, 5, 8)>

So, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [10]
