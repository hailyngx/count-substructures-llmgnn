Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. From node 2: <2, (0, 4, 8)>
3. From node 4: <4, (0, 2, 8)>
4. From node 5: <5, (0, 1, 8)>
5. From node 8: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
6. From node 6: <6, (0, 8, 9)>

So, there are 6 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
