Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, _)> (center node: 0, leaves: 2, 3)
2. <1, (2, 5, 6)> (center node: 1, leaves: 2, 5, 6)
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)> (center node: 2, leaves: 0, 1, 5)
4. <3, (0, 4, 5)> (center node: 3, leaves: 0, 4, 5)
5. <4, (1, 3, 7)> (center node: 4, leaves: 1, 3, 7)
6. <5, (1, 2, 9)> (center node: 5, leaves: 1, 2, 9)
7. <6, (1, 2, 7)> (center node: 6, leaves: 1, 2, 7)
8. <9, (2, 5, 8)> (center node: 9, leaves: 2, 5, 8)

There are a total of [8] 3-star graphs in this given graph.
