Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph, which are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

The central nodes in this graph are: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph, where each 3-star consists of a central node and three connected nodes.

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
