Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from node 1:
   - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (3, 6, 9)>

2. Moving to node 2:
   - No 3-star centered at node 2.

3. Moving to node 3:
   - <3, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <3, (1, 5, 6)>

4. Moving to node 4:
   - No 3-star centered at node 4.

5. Moving to node 5:
   - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (3, 4, 6)>

6. Moving to node 6:
   - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 5, 9)>
   - <6, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (3, 5, 9)>

7. Moving to node 7:
   - <7, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <7, (3, 5, 6)>

8. Moving to node 8:
   - No 3-star centered at node 8.

9. Moving to node 9:
   - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 8)>


All unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<5, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 9)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 9)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<6, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 6, 9)>, 
<7, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<9, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<9, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [25]
