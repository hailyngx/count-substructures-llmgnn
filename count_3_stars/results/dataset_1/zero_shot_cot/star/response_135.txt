Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 9, 1)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
