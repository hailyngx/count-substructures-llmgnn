Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

From the information above, we have the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 5, 8)>  
<1, (4, 5, 9)>  
<1, (5, 8, 9)>  
<5, (0, 2, 7)>  
<5, (1, 2, 7)>  
<5, (0, 1, 9)>  
<6, (3, 7, 9)>  

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
