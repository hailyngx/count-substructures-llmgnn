Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 since it will be the central node in the 3-stars. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
5. <6, (1, 5, 8)>
6. <8, (0, 3, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us the answer: [6].
