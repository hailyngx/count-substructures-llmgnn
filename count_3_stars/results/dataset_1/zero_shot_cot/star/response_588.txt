Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the given edges:
- Node 1 has 5 edges connected (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected (2,0), (2,4), (2,9)
- Node 3 has 3 edges connected (3,1), (3,7), (3,8)
- Node 4 has 2 edges connected (4,1), (4,2)
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected (5,1), (5,6)
- Node 6 has 2 edges connected (6,1), (6,5)
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected (7,1), (7,3), (7,8)
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected (8,3), (8,7), (8,9)
- Node 9 has 2 edges connected (9,2), (9,8)

Based on the edges connected, we have the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [5] 3-stars.
