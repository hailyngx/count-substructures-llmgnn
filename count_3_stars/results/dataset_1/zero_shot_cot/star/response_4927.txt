Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are in a 3-star configuration. Nodes with degree 3 are potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 3

Nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 have degrees equal to 3 or more, which makes them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's construct the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- Potential central node: Node 2
  - (2, 1), (2, 3)
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Potential central node: Node 3
  - (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6)
  - <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- Potential central node: Node 6
  - (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 8)
  - <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- Potential central node: Node 8
  - (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)
  - <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
