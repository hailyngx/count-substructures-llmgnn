Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [4].

List of unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
