Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph.
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 connections.

1. Nodes with 3 connections: Nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8 have 3 connections each.

Now, let's list the 3-stars:

<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
