Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected  
   - Node 2, 4, and 8 have 3 edges connected.  

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if it forms a 3-star.  
   - For node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 4), (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 8) are potential 3-stars.  
   - For node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 2), (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 7) are potential 3-stars.  
   - For node 8: (8, 2, 9) is a potential 3-star.  

Step 3: Count the valid 3-stars formed from the above potential 3-stars.  
   - Valid 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>
