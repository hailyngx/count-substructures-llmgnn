Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list down all the possible 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 3, -)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 8)>
6. <5, (8, 9, -)>
7. <6, (7, 9, -)>
8. <7, (6, -, -)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 5)>
10. <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph:
