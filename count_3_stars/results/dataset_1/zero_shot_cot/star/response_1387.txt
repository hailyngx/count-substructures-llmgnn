Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 8), forming 4 possible 3-stars:  
<0, (5, 6, 7)>  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<0, (5, 7, 8)>  
<0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 1 has 1 neighbor (9), not forming any 3-star.

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8), forming 4 possible 3-stars:  
<2, (4, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 6, 8)>  
<2, (4, 7, 8)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (7, 8), but not forming any 3-star.

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 9), forming 1 possible 3-star:  
<4, (2, 5, 9)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7), forming 1 possible 3-star:  
<5, (0, 4, 7)>

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9), forming 1 possible 3-star:  
<6, (0, 2, 9)>

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5, 9), forming 5 possible 3-stars:  
<7, (0, 2, 5)>  
<7, (0, 2, 9)>  
<7, (0, 3, 5)>  
<7, (2, 3, 9)>  
<7, (2, 5, 9)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3), but not forming any 3-star.

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7), forming 4 possible 3-stars:  
<9, (1, 4, 7)>  
<9, (1, 6, 7)>  
<9, (4, 6, 7)>  
<9, (4, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]  
Unique 3-stars:

<5, (0, 4, 7)>  
<6, (0, 2, 9)>  
<7, (0, 2, 5)>  
<7, (0, 2, 9)>  
<7, (0, 3, 5)>  
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
