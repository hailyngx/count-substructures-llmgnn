Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 since node 0 will be the center of the 3-star.
    - Node 0 is connected to node 8.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
    
Now, we can form the 3-stars with the center node 0 and its connected nodes:
<0, (8, 6, 1)>
<0, (8, 6, 2)>
    
Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [2].
