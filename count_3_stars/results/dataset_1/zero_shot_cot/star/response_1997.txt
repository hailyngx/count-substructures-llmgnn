Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 7

Next, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
