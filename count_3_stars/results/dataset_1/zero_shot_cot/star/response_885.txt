Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-star configurations.

1. Nodes with degrees:
   - Node 0: degree 5
   - Node 1: degree 2
   - Node 2: degree 1
   - Node 3: degree 5
   - Node 4: degree 1
   - Node 5: degree 1
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 7: degree 2
   - Node 8: degree 1
   - Node 9: degree 3

2. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can find all possible 3-stars by iterating through each node and checking if it forms a 3-star configuration.

3. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
   - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 0, 8)>
   - <3, (4, 0, 9)>
   - <3, (5, 0, 6)>
   - <3, (6, 0, 7)>
   - <3, (6, 2, 9)>
   - <3, (7, 0, 9)>
   - <9, (3, 7, 4)>
   - <9, (3, 7, 6)>

4. Count of 3-stars: [14]
