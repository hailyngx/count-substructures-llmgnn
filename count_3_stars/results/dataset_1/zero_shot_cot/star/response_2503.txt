Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
