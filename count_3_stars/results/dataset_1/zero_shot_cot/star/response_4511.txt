Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in this given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 6
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 9
- Node 6: Connected to node 2
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7

Step 2: Find the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars [4].

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
