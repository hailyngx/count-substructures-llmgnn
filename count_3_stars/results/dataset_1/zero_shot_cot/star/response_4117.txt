Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 9, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
