Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting by looking at each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9 --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6 --> Could form a 3-star.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9 --> <1, (3, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7 --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9 --> <1, (5, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8 --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9 --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6 --> Not a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7 --> Not a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
