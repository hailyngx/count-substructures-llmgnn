Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided, we can list the 3-stars one by one:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
