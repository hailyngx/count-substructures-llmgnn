Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify Nodes with Exactly 3 Neighbors
    - Node 2 has exactly 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 3)
    - Node 6 has exactly 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 7)
    - Node 7 has exactly 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 3, 4)
    - Node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, 9)
    - Node 9 has exactly 3 neighbors (nodes 3, 4, 8)

Step 2: Count the Number of 3-Stars
    - There are 5 nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, representing potential central nodes for 3-stars.
    - Each 3-star consists of the central node and its 3 neighbors.

Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of 3-Stars
    - For each of the identified nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, there is one unique 3-star.
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
