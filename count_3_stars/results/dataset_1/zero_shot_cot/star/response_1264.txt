Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes and their respective edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to node 4
- Node 2 is connected to node 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 is part of 2 3-stars: <0, (6, 9)> and <0, (6, 3)>
- Node 1 is not the center of any 3-star
- Node 2 is not the center of any 3-star
- Node 3 is part of 1 3-star: <3, (6, 7)>
- Node 4 is part of 5 3-stars: <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, and <4, (8, 9, 1)>
- Node 5 is not the center of any 3-star
- Node 6 is part of 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 0, 3)>, <6, (4, 3, 0)>, and <6, (3, 4, 0)>
- Node 7 is not the center of any 3-star
- Node 8 is part of 4 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 2)>, <8,(4, 2, 3)>, and <8, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 9 is part of 4 3-stars: <9, (0, 8, 4)>, <9, (4, 0, 8)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, and <9, (4, 8, 0)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 23.]
[<0, (6, 9)>, <0, (6, 3)>, <3, (6, 7)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 0, 3)>, <6, (4, 3, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 3)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 4)>, <9, (4, 0, 8)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 0)>]
