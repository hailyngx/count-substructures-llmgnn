Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 7, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 4)
3. Node 2: (2, 4, 6)
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 7)
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 2)
6. Node 6: (6, 1, 2)
7. Node 7: (7, 0, 2)
8. Node 8: (8, 1, 3)

Therefore, there are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the graph.
