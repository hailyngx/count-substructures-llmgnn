Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 9

2. Now, let's find all the 3-stars with node 0 as the center node:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
  
3. Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1:
- Node 4, Node 7, Node 8

4. Now, let's find all the 3-stars with node 1 as the center node:
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
  
5. Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the answer is [2].
