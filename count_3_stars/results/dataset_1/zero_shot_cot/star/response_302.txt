Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node has exactly 3 edges connected to it, forming a 3-star.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8) <0, (4, 5, 8)>
2. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 8) <2, (1, 6, 8)>
3. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3) <4, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5) <7, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
