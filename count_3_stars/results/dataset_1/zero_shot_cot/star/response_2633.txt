Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0:
   - (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5)
   <0, (1, 2, 5)>

2. Node 1:
   - (1, 0), (1, 7)
   <1, (0, 7)>

3. Node 2:
   - (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8)
   <2, (0, 4, 5)>

4. Node 5:
   - (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9)
   <5, (0, 2, 7)>

5. Node 4:
   - (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6)
   <4, (2, 3, 6)>

6. Node 7:
   - (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8)
   <7, (1, 5, 8)>

7. Node 8:
   - (8, 2), (8, 7)
   <8, (2, 7)>

8. Node 9:
   - (9, 5)

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 7)>
