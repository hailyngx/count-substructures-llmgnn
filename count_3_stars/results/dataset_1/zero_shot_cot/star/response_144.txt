Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 1, as an edge connected to node 1 means it's directly connected to the central node in a 3-star.

Nodes directly connected to node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, for each node directly connected to node 1, we will check if there are two other nodes that are also connected to both the central node (1) and the selected node. If such pairs exist, then we have a 3-star.

For node 3:
Pairs connected to both 1 and 3: (1, 7), (1, 8)
=> 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 8)>

For node 5:
Pairs connected to both 1 and 5: (1, 4), (1, 7)
=> 3-star: <1, (5, 4, 7)>

For node 6: (No 3-star)

For node 7:
Pairs connected to both 1 and 7: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8)
=> 3-stars: <1, (7, 2, 3)>, <1, (7, 5, 8)>

For node 8: (No 3-star)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (7, 2, 3)>, <1, (7, 5, 8)>.
