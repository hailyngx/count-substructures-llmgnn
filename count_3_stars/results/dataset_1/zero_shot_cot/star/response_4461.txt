Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 6, 8)> and <3, (5, 7, 9)>.
