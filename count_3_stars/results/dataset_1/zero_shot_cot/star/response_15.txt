Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 8
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
