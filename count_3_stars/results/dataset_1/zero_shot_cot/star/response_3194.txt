Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
8. <7, (2, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (3, 5, 6)>
10. <9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
