Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph can have degree 3. Let's identify the central nodes that have degree 3 in the given graph. 

Looking at the list of edges, we can see that the nodes 8 and 2 have degree 3. Let's consider each of them as the center node and find the connected nodes in each case.

For node 8:
- (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9)
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 2:
- (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8)
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>.
