Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph would be nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (7, 9, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
