Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first analyze the graph:

- Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 has an edge with node 5.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 0, 3, and 9. 
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 7 has an edge with node 2.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form the following 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, and <0, (1, 6, 9)>.
- Node 1 can form the following 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, and <1, (0, 8, 9)>.
- Node 2 can form the following 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 7)>.
- Node 4 can form the following 3-stars: <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, and <4, (6, 8, 9)>.
- Node 5 can form the following 3-star: <5, (0, 9, 3)>.
- Node 9 can form the following 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 5)> and <9, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12.

Final answer: [12]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 9, 3)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
