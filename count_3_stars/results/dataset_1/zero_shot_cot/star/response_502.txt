Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, as it can be the central node of a star. The nodes connected to node 0 are: 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's consider node 0 as the central node and identify the 3-stars connected to it:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>

Next, consider node 3 as the central node and identify the 3-stars connected to it:
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- <3, (0, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
