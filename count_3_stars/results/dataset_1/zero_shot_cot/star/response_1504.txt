Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 as the center:
    <0, (1, 2, 9)>
    <0, (1, 2, 9)>
    
2. Node 2 as the center:
    <2, (0, 9, 0)>
    <2, (0, 9, 0)>
    
3. Node 9 as the center:
    <9, (0, 2, 0)>
    <9, (0, 2, 0)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
