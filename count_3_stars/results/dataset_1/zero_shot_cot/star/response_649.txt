Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-star configurations. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1)>
<4, (9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
