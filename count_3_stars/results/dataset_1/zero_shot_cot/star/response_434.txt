Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

So, there are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
