Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the list of edges provided, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 0: <8, (4, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
