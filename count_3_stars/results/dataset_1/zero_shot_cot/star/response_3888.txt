Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and the leaves connected to them. A central node is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

- Central node 0 has leaves 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Central node 1 has leaves 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
- Central node 2 has leaves 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Central node 3 has leaves 0, 4, and 9.
- Central node 4 has leaves 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Central node 5 has leaves 1, 2, and 6.
- Central node 6 has leaves 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Central node 7 has leaves 0, 1, 4, and 8.
- Central node 8 has leaves 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Central node 9 has leaves 0, 3, 6, and 8.

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:

- There are 4 unique 3-stars with central node 0: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>.
- There are 10 unique 3-stars with central node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>.
- There are 4 unique 3-stars with central node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>.
- There are 3 unique 3-stars with central node 3: <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>.
- There are 15 unique 3-stars with central node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>.
- There are 3 unique 3-stars with central node 5: <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>.
- There are 5 unique 3-stars with central node 6: <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
- There are 4 unique 3-stars with central node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>.
- There are 4 unique 3-stars with central node 8: <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
- There are 4 unique 3-stars with central node 9: <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].
