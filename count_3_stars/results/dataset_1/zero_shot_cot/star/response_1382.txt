Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (2, 7, 9)
2. Node 1: (2, 5, 9)
3. Node 2: (0, 1, 6)
4. Node 5: (1, 6, 7)
5. Node 6: (2, 5, 8)
6. Node 7: (0, 5, 8)
7. Node 8: (3, 6, 7)
8. Node 9: (0, 1, 3)

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [8].
