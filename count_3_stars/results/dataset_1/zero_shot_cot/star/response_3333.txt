Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
  <8, (4, 5, 6)>
  <8, (4, 5, 7)>
  <8, (4, 6, 7)>
  <8, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
  <9, (0, 2, 5)>
  <9, (0, 2, 6)>
  <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
