Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star-like structure.

Let's analyze the graph and list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 9, 6)>
<8, (3, 9, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
