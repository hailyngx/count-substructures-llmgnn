Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. In a 3-star, the center must be connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given edges, we can see that the nodes with the potential to be centers of 3-stars are: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's analyze the connections of each potential center node to find the 3-stars.

1. For node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
   - <0, (5, 8, 9)>

2. For node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
   - <2, (7, 8, 9)>

3. For node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9 (four neighbors).
   - Since it has four connections, node 6 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

4. For node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 (five neighbors).
   - Since it has five connections, node 7 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

5. For node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
   - <8, (0, 2, 3)>   
   - <8, (6, 7, 9)>

6. For node 9:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8 (Note: already counted in 8's 3-star). 
   - <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [4]  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (5, 8, 9)>  
<2, (7, 8, 9)>  
<8, (0, 2, 3)>  
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
