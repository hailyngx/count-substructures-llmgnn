Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the provided edges, we can see the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Finally, we count the number of 3-stars inside brackets:
[3]
