Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
