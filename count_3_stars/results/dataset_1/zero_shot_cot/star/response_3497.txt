Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <3, (7, 9, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 0)>
7. <6, (2, 4, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (7, 6, 0)>
10. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
