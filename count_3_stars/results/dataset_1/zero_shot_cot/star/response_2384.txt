Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's first identify these nodes:
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 (5 edges)
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 4, 7, and 9 (3 edges)

Therefore, the nodes that can act as centers of 3-stars in this graph are nodes 1 and 5.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 4, 8)>
<1, (8, 3, 6)>
<1, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 8)>
<1, (8, 9, 6)>

<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 4, 9)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
