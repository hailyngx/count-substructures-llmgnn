Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 1:
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 3)>
    
2. Central node 2:
    - <2, (7, 9, 6)>
    
3. Central node 4:
    - <4, (5, 8, 9)>
    
4. Central node 5:
    - <5, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <5, (4, 7, 1)>
    
5. Central node 6:
    - <6, (7, 9, 2)>
    
6. Central node 7:
    - <7, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <7, (1, 2, 0)>
    - <7, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <7, (6, 9, 2)>
    
7. Central node 9:
    - <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
