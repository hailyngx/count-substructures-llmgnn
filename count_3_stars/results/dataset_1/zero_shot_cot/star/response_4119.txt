Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
