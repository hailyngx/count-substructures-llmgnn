Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9. None of these connections form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8. This forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 8)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8. None of these connections form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8. None of these connections form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. This does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. This does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2. This does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 5. This does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9. None of these connections form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8. None of these connections form a 3-star.

Therefore, there is only one unique 3-star in the given graph: <1, (0, 3, 8)>.

So, the final answer is [1].
