Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 9, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, -)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars, which is [9].
