Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three connections each, as these are potential central nodes of 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 4 connections
- Node 1 has 4 connections
- Node 4 has 5 connections
- Node 5 has 5 connections
- Node 6 has 5 connections
- Node 9 has 5 connections

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
- For node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6) - Total: 3
- For node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 6) - Total: 3
- For node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 6), (4, 3, 6) - Total: 4
- For node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 6), (5, 1, 7), (5, 1, 9) - Total: 4
- For node 6: (6, 0, 3), (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 5), (6, 5, 7) - Total: 4
- For node 9: (9, 2, 5), (9, 5, 7), (9, 5, 8) - Total: 3

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3] = [21].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
