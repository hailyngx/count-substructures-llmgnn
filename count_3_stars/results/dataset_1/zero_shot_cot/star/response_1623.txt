Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the subgraphs where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>

There are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
