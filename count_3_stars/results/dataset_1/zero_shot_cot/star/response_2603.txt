Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go through the nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4 which forms a 3-star. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9, but it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5 which forms a 3-star. <2, (0, 4, 5)> and <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 6, but it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9 which forms a 3-star. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 5 is connected to node 2 but does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, but it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9, but it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 9, but it does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8, but it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, and <4, (0, 2, 9)>. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
