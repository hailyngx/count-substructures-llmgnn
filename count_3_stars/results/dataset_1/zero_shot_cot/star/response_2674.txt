Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the ones with exactly three incident edges. In this case, the central nodes are nodes 2 and 3.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 2, the leaves are nodes 1, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Since we need to consider only 3-stars, we will choose any 3 possible leaves connected to node 2.

    <2, (1, 4, 5)>
    <2, (1, 4, 8)>
    <2, (1, 4, 9)>
    <2, (1, 5, 8)>
    <2, (1, 5, 9)>
    <2, (1, 8, 9)>
    <2, (4, 5, 8)>
    <2, (4, 5, 9)>
    <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    <2, (5, 8, 9)>

- For node 3, the leaves are nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8. Again, we will pick any 3 possible leaves connected to node 3.

    <3, (4, 6, 7)>
    <3, (4, 6, 8)>
    <3, (4, 7, 8)>
    <3, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the total unique 3-stars found, we get 14:
[14]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 14.
