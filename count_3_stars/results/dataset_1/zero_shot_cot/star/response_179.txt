Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes and their adjacent nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining each node as a potential center of a 3-star:
1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
   
2. For Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
   
3. For Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 6, 7)>
   
4. For Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 3, 8)>
   
5. For Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
   
6. For Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 4, 8)>
   
7. For Node 8:
   - <8, (1, 5, 9)>
   
8. For Node 9:
   - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
