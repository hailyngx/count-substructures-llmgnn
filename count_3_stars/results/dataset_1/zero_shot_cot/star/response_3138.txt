Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>
<3, (7, 5, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
