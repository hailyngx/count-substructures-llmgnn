Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Node 0 has 2 edges: (0, 5), (0, 8). Neither forms a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 2 edges: (1, 7), (1, 9). Neither forms a 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 2 edges: (2, 3), (2, 6). <2, (3, 6, 2)> forms a 3-star.
4. Node 3 has 4 edges: (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8). <3, (2, 5, 6)> forms a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7). <4, (5, 6, 7)> forms a 3-star.
6. Node 5 has 3 edges: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4). <5, (0, 3, 4)> forms a 3-star.
7. Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4). <6, (2, 3, 4)> forms a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 2 edges: (7, 1), (7, 4). Neither forms a 3-star.
9. Node 8 has 3 edges: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 9). <8, (0, 3, 9)> forms a 3-star.
10. Node 9 has 2 edges: (9, 1), (9, 8). Neither forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <2, (3, 6, 2)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>.

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
