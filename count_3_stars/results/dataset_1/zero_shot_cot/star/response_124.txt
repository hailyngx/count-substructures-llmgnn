Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9 
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-star graphs by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors and form a 3-star structure.  

Here are the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, *)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find 9 in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
