Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
From the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying the center nodes and their attached nodes. 

Let's start counting the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The answer is [2] because there are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
