Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: (0, 2, 5), (0, 5, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 2, 5)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 4, 1)
- Node 4: (4, 2, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 4, 5), (6, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 6, 8), (7, 8, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 4, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5)>, <2, (0, 1)>, <2, (4, 1)>, <4, (2, 6)>, <5, (0, 8)>, <6, (4, 5)>, <6, (5, 7)>, <7, (6, 8)>, <7, (8, 9)>.
