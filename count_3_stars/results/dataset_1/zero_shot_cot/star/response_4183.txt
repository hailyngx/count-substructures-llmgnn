Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have [11].
