Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star. We will start by listing all the possible 3-stars based on the given edges.

Given edges:
(0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) 
(1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) 
(2, 0) (2, 1) 
(3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) 
(4, 0) (4, 6) 
(5, 1) (5, 3) 
(6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) 
(7, 3) (7, 8) 
(8, 7) 
(9, 3) (9, 6)

Now, let's find all unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 9), (0, 4, 9), (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 8, 3)>
<8, (7, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 3), (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
