Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes in the graph based on the edges given. The graph consists of the following nodes:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. Remember, a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

From the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
