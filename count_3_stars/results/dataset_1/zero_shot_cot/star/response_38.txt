Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of nodes that form 3-star structures. Let's list them step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to each node:
    - Node 0 is connected to node 5.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
    - Node 4 is connected to node 1.
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
    - Node 7 is connected to node 8.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.

2. Identify 3-stars:
    - <0, (5, 8, 2)> - 3-star centered at node 0.
    - <1, (2, 4, 5)> - 3-star centered at node 1.
    - <5, (0, 2, 8)> - 3-star centered at node 5.
    - <8, (5, 7, 2)> - 3-star centered at node 8.

Count of 3-stars: [4]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
