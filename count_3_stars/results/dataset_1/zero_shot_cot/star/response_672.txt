Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 0, 5

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (2, 9, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 2)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
