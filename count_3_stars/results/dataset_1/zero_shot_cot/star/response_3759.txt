Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes in the graph along with their connections:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2
Node 2: 1, 7, 8
Node 3: 6
Node 4: 0, 5, 9
Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 0, 2, 5
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 4, 5

Now, we observe that node 0, 5, and 7 form 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
