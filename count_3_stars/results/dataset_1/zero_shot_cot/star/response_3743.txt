Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
4. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
5. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <1, (4, 2, 6)>
7. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
8. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
9. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
10. <3, (6, 7, 8)>
11. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
12. <5, (2, 7, 9)>
13. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
14. <6, (4, 8, 6)>
15. <7, (3, 5, 8)>
16. <8, (2, 3, 6)>

There are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
