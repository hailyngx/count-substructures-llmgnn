Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start analyzing the graph step by step:
1. List all the nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
2. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
   - Node 0: {5, 6, 7}
   - Node 1: {6, 9}
   - Node 2: {3, 8, 9}
   - Node 3: {2, 5, 8}
   - Node 4: {5, 6, 7}
   - Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7}
   - Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7}
   - Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
   - Node 8: {2, 3, 9}
   - Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For a 3-star to exist, one node has to be the center, and the other three nodes have to be connected to this center node.
- Let's go through each node and count the 3-stars:
   - For central node 0: <0, (5, 6, 7)> (1 star)
   - For central node 1: <1, (6, 9, _)> (1 star)
   - For central node 2: <2, (3, 8, 9)> (1 star)
   - For central node 3: <3, (2, 5, 8)> (1 star)
   - For central node 4: <4, (5, 6, 7)> (1 star)
   - For central node 5: <5, (0, 3, 4)> (1 star)
   - For central node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)> (1 star)
   - For central node 7: <7, (0, 4, 5)> (1 star)
   - For central node 8: <8, (2, 3, 9)> (1 star)
   - For central node 9: <9, (1, 2, 7)> (1 star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 9, _)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>
