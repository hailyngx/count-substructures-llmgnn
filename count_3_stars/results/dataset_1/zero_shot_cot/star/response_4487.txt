Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the central node for each 3-star. To be a central node of a 3-star, a node must have exactly three adjacent nodes (leaves) in the graph. 

The nodes with three adjacent nodes in the given graph are:
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7)

Next, we identify the 3-stars with these central nodes:
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
