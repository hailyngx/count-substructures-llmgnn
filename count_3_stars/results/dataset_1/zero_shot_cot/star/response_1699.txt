Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 0: (0, 3, 6) and (0, 3, 4) <0, (3, 6, 4)>
2. From node 1: (1, 5, 7) <1, (5, 7, 9)>
3. From node 3: (3, 0, 4) and (3, 4, 8) <3, (0, 4, 8)>
4. From node 4: (4, 3, 8) <4, (3, 8, 7)>
5. From node 5: (5, 1, 7) and (5, 7, 9) <5, (1, 7, 9)>
6. From node 6: (6, 0, 3) <6, (0, 3, 4)>
7. From node 7: (7, 5, 9) and (7, 8, 9) <7, (5, 9, 8)>
8. From node 8: (8, 4, 7) and (8, 7, 9) <8, (4, 7, 9)>
9. From node 9: (9, 5, 7) and (9, 7, 8) <9, (5, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>.
