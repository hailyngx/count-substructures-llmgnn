Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the potential central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the edge list provided, the central nodes are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Next, we need to find all unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's go through each potential central node:

1. Central node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6. 
   The 3-star formed with node 0 as the central node and nodes 1, 2, 3 as the leaves: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   Total 3-stars with central node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)> 

2. Central node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 8.
   The 3-stars formed with node 1 as the central node and nodes 0, 3, 4 as the leaves: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
   The 3-stars formed with node 1 as the central node and nodes 0, 3, 7 as the leaves: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
   The 3-stars formed with node 1 as the central node and nodes 3, 4, 7 as the leaves: <1, (3, 4, 7)>
   Total 3-stars with central node 1: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>

3. Central node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5. No 3-star can be formed from this central node configuration.

4. Central node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
   The 3-star formed with node 3 as the central node and nodes 0, 1, 6 as the leaves: <3, (0, 1, 6)>
   Total 3-stars with central node 3: <3, (0, 1, 6)>

5. Central node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, 9.
   The 3-stars formed with node 5 as the central node and nodes 2, 7, 8 as the leaves: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
   Total 3-stars with central node 5: <5, (2, 7, 8)>

6. Central node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 3.
   The 3-star formed with node 6 as the central node and nodes 0, 3 as the leaves: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
   Total 3-stars with central node 6: <6, (0, 3, 5)>

7. Central node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 5.
   No 3-star can be formed from this central node configuration.

8. Central node 9: Connected to node 5. No 3-star can be formed from this central node configuration.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [4]
