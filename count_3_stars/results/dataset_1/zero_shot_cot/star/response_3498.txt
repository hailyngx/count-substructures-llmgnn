Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 6)>
5. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
6. <5, (1, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 3, 8)>
8. <7, (1, 4, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 2, 5)>
10. <9, (0, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
