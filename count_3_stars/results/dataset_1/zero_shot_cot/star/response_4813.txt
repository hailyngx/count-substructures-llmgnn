Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, -)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, -, -)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
