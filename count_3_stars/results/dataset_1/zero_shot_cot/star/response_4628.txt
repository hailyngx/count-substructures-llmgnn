Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three neighbors for each possible 3-star combination. 
Let's start by listing all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Now, we can count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
There are 10 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is [10].
