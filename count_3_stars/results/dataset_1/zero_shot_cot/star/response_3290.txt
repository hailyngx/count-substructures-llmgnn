Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node has exactly three neighboring nodes. 

Analyzing the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 1 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
