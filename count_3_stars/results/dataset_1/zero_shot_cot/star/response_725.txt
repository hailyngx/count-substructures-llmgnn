Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7. 
   - <0, (3, 7)> is a 3-star.

2. Node 1 is connected to node 7. No 3-star centered at node 1.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7. No 3-star centered at node 2.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9.
   - <3, (0, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 9. 
   - <4, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <4, (3, 7, 9)> are 3-stars.

6. Node 5 is connected to node 6. No 3-star centered at node 5.

7. Node 6 is connected to node 5. No 3-star centered at node 6.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4.
   - <7, (0, 1, 4)> is a 3-star.

9. Node 8 is connected to node 9. No 3-star centered at node 8.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8.
   - <9, (3, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, and <7, (0, 1, 4)>.
