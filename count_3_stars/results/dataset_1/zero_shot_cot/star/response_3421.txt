Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

The center nodes are: 
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 6, 9, and no other node)

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph based on these center nodes. 

Based on the center node 5:
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 4, 3)>
- <5, (3, 0, 4)>
- <5, (3, 4, 0)>
- <5, (4, 0, 3)>
- <5, (4, 3, 0)>

Based on the center node 6:
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 5, 2)>
- <6, (2, 1, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 1)>
- <6, (5, 1, 2)>
- <6, (5, 2, 1)>

Based on the center node 4:
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 8, 5)>
- <4, (5, 2, 8)>
- <4, (5, 8, 2)>
- <4, (8, 2, 5)>
- <4, (8, 5, 2)>

Based on the center node 7:
- <7, (6, 9, no other node)>

Counting all the unique 3-star configurations, we get a total of [18] 3-stars.
