Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the 3-stars in this graph.

The possible centers for the 3-star will be the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's check each node:

1. Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes (2, 4, 8, 9).
2. Node 1 is connected to 1 node (3).
3. Node 2 is connected to 5 nodes (0, 3, 6, 7, 6).
4. Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 2, 6, 7).
5. Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes (0, 8).
6. Node 5 is connected to 1 node (7).
7. Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes (2, 3, 9, 7).
8. Node 7 is connected to 5 nodes (2, 3, 5, 8).
9. Node 8 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 4, 7).
10. Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes (0, 6).

Based on this information, nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7 are the potential centers for 3-stars.

Let's enumerate the 3-stars with their central nodes and leaves:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
