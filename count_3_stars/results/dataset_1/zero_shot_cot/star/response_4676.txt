Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. We are looking for nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
From the given edges, the following nodes have exactly 3 incident edges: 0, 1, 2, and 9.

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed the central nodes of any 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. No 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. No 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6. No 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. No 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph.
