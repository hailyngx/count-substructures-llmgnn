Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

First, let's list the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: <0, (5, 7, 9)>
2. Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 7)>
