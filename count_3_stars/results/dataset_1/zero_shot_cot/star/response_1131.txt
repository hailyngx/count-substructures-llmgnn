Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly three edges each, forming 3-stars. Since each 3-star has the center and three leaves, we need to look for nodes that are adjacent to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 7 are connected to exactly three other nodes each. Here are the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
