Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes are connected to each node. This will help us visualize the graph better:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 
We will go through each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star).

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
