Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
  
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph.

To find the number of 3-stars, we will look for all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 2)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
