Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0: Connected to 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: Connected to 2, 4, 8
- Node 2: Connected to 0, 1, 7
- Node 3: Connected to 0, 5, 9
- Node 4: Connected to 1, 8
- Node 5: Connected to 0, 3, 8
- Node 6: Connected to 0, 9
- Node 7: Connected to 2
- Node 8: Connected to 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: Connected to 3, 6

Now, let's start counting the 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 8, 5)>
2. <0, (3, 5, 8)>
3. <0, (5, 8, 3)>
4. <1, (2, 8, 4)>
5. <3, (0, 5, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 3, 8)>
7. <8, (0, 5, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
