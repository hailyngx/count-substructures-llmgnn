Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Starting with each node as the center of the 3-star:
- For node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 7)
- For node 1: (1, 4, 5)
- For node 2: (2, 0, 5), (2, 5, 9)
- For node 3: (3, 0, 6), (3, 6, 8), (3, 8, 9)
- For node 4: (4, 0, 6), (4, 1, 6), (4, 6, 7), (4, 7, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 0, 8)
- For node 6: (6, 3, 4)
- For node 7: (7, 0, 8)
- For node 8: (8, 3, 4), (8, 4, 5), (8, 5, 7)
- For node 9: (9, 2, 3)

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5)>, <2, (0, 5)>, <2, (5, 9)>, <3, (0, 6)>, <3, (6, 8)>, <3, (8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6)>, <4, (1, 6)>, <4, (6, 7)>, <4, (7, 8)>, <5, (0, 8)>, <6, (3, 4)>, <7, (0, 8)>, <8, (3, 4)>, <8, (4, 5)>, <8, (5, 7)>, <9, (2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [20] 3-stars.
