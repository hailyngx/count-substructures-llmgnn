Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with three edges connected to them.
    - Nodes with 3 edges: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
   
Step 2: For each node with 3 edges, identify the 3-star configurations.
    - Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 5, 6), (0, 6, 7)
    - Node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 6), (1, 6, 7)
    - Node 2: (2, 0, 5), (2, 5, 6), (2, 6, 9)
    - Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 1, 4), (6, 2, 5)
    - Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 1, 3), (7, 7, 9)
    
Step 3: List the unique 3-stars.
    <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (6, 9, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (7, 9, 7)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
