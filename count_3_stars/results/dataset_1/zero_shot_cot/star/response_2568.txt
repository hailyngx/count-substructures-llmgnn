Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. In this case, nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 are connected to 3 other nodes. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each center node:
- Node 2: (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), and (2, 6, 9) = 3 3-stars
- Node 3: (3, 2, 8) = 1 3-star
- Node 4: (4, 2, 7) = 1 3-star
- Node 5: (5, 2, 8) = 1 3-star
- Node 6: (6, 2, 9) = 1 3-star
- Node 8: (8, 3, 5) and (8, 5, 9) = 2 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

<List of unique 3-stars found: <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 5)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>.>
