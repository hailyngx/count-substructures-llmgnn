Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given edges, we can find the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7: <2, (0, 4, 7)> 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6: <4, (0, 1, 6)> 

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
