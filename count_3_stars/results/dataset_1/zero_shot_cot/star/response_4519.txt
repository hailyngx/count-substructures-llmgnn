Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's list all the possible unique 3-stars with the center and leaves:

1. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <2, (7, 9, 1)>
5. <2, (1, 7, 9)>
6. <4, (6, 7, 5)>
7. <5, (0, 6, 2)>
8. <6, (4, 5, 7)>
9. <7, (1, 2, 4)>
10. <7, (2, 4, 9)>
11. <9, (0, 2, 7)>
12. <9, (2, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
