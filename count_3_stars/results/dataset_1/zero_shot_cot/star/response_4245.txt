Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
