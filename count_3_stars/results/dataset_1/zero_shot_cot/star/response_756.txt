Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their degree:
   - Node 0: degree 6
   - Node 1: degree 2
   - Node 2: degree 1
   - Node 4: degree 2
   - Node 5: degree 1
   - Node 6: degree 2
   - Node 7: degree 3
   - Node 8: degree 2
   - Node 9: degree 2

2. Find the 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)> (Node 0 with nodes 1, 2, and 4)
   - <0, (7, 8, 9)> (Node 0 with nodes 7, 8, and 9)

[There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph.]
