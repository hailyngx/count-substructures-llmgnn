Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes can serve as the center of the 3-stars. Given that a 3-star graph has the center connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with degree 3. 

From the provided list of edges, the nodes and their corresponding degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8 have degrees that are not equal to 3, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star. However, nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9 have degree 3, and therefore, they can be the center of a 3-star.

Let's now list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
