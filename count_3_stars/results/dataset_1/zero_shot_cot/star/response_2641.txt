Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a "star" pattern.

When we examine the edges provided, we can see that there are two 3-stars in this graph. Let's identify them:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9: <2, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
