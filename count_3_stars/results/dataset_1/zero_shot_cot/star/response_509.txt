Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (0, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 7, -)>
5. <4, (1, -, -)>
6. <5, (8, 9, -)>
7. <6, (1, 2, -)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 3)>
9. <8, (0, 5, -)>
10. <9, (1, 2, 5)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. So, the final answer is [10].
