Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Please see below the identified 3-star graphs:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
