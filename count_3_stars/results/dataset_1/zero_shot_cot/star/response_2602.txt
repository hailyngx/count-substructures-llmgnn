Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 has 4 edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), and (0, 6). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 0 and nodes 2, 3, and 5 as leaves. <0, (2, 3, 5)>

2. Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 4), (1, 6), and (1, 7). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 1 and nodes 4, 6, and 7 as leaves. <1, (4, 6, 7)>

3. Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 0), (2, 3), and (2, 4). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 2 and nodes 0, 3, and 4 as leaves. <2, (0, 3, 4)>

4. Node 3 has 4 edges: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 7), and (3, 9). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 3 and nodes 0, 2, and 7 as leaves. <3, (0, 2, 7)>

5. Node 6 has 5 edges: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), and (6, 9). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 6 and nodes 0, 1, and 7 as leaves. <6, (0, 1, 7)>

6. Node 7 has 5 edges: (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), and (7, 9). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 7 and nodes 1, 3, and 6 as leaves. <7, (1, 3, 6)>

7. Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), and (8, 9). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 8 and nodes 5, 6, and 7 as leaves. <8, (5, 6, 7)>

8. Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7), and (9, 8). Since it is connected to exactly 3 nodes, a 3-star is formed with the center at node 9 and nodes 3, 6, and 7 as leaves. <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
