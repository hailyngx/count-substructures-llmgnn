Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (3, 9, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
