Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by locating the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
