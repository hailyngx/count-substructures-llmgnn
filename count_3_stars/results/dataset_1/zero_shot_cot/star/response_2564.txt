Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 2, 4, 6  
Node 1: 3, 4, 5  
Node 2: 0, 8  
Node 3: 1, 4, 6  
Node 4: 0, 1, 3  
Node 5: 1, 7  
Node 6: 0, 3, 7  
Node 7: 5, 6  
Node 8: 2  

We can see that node 0, 1, 3 are potential centers of a 3-star. Let's list out the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>  
<1, (3, 4, 5)>  
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
