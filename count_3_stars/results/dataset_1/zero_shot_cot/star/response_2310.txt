Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, 2, and 4 since these nodes can act as the center of a 3-star graph. 

- Node 0 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.

Let's count the 3-stars now.

- For node 0, the only 3-star is <0, (8, 6, 8)>.
- For node 2, the 3-stars are <2, (3, 4, 9)> and <2, (4, 3, 7)>.
- For node 4, the 3-stars are <4, (2, 3, 7)> and <4, (3, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (8, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, and <4, (3, 2, 7)>.
