Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which will be the central nodes of our 3-stars. These nodes will be nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 7), (1, 5, 9) [4 3-stars]
- Node 2: (2, 1, 6), (2, 6, 8) [2 3-stars]
- Node 4: (4, 1, 7) [1 3-stars]
- Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 3, 9) [2 3-stars]
- Node 6: (6, 1, 2) [1 3-stars]
- Node 8: (8, 1, 2) [1 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].  
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 2)>, <1, (2, 4, 1)>, <1, (4, 7, 1)>, <1, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, <5, (3, 9, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>
