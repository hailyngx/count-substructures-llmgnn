Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (6, 8, -)>
3. <2, (5, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 6, -)>
5. <4, (7, -, -)>
6. <5, (2, -, -)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (2, 4, 6)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 9)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
