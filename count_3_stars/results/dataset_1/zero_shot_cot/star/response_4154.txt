Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. These are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 0, 1, and 5. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph, following the definition provided earlier.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
