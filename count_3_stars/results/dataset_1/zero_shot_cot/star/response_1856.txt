Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with degree 3. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
In this graph, the nodes with degree 3 are 0, 1, and 7.

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, find the three nodes that are connected to it to form a 3-star.
- For node 0: (0, 4, 6), (0, 4, 8)
- For node 1: (1, 4, 7), (1, 8, 9)
- For node 7: (7, 3, 5), (7, 5, 6)

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars inside <>:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>

Step 4: Count the total number of 3-stars listed inside <> and output the final answer inside brackets []:
[3]
