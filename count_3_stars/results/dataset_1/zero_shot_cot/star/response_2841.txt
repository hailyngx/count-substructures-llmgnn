Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [7].
