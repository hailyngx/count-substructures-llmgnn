Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-star configurations in the given graph.

There are two 3-star configurations:
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
