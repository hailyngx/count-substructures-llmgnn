Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, _)> (Node 3 only has two leaves which is not a valid 3-star)
<4, (0, 6, _)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, _)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, _)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, _)>
