Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by examining each node to see if it is the central node of a 3-star. 

- Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star <1, (0, 2, 6)>.
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star <2, (1, 3, 4)>.
- Node 3: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms a 3-star <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
- Node 5: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 6: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 7: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 8: Not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 9: Not a central node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
