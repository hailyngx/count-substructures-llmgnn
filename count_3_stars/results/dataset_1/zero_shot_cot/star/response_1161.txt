Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their respective neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 6)>
<1, (0, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
