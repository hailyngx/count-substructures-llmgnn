Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star has exactly three leaves connected to its center node, we can look for nodes with exactly three incident edges.

The nodes with three incident edges are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 6, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 6, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 4, 6, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 5)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 7)

Next, let's construct the 3-stars based on the identified central nodes:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 6, 9)>
2. Node 3: <3, (2, 6, 8)>
3. Node 5: <5, (4, 6, 9)>
4. Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
5. Node 9: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
