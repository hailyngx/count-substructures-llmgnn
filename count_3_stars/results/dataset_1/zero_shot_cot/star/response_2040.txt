Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, the central node (center) will have exactly three neighbors (leaves). 

Let's enumerate all 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (7)>
<2, (5, 9)>
<3, (0, 5)>
<4, (0)>
<5, (2, 3)>
<6, (8)>
<7, (1)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
