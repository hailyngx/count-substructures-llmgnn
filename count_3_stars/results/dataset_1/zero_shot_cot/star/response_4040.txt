Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
We can start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three incident edges. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [5].
