Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[Total number of 3-stars: 3]

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
