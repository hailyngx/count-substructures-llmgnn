Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We will look for each node in the graph and check if it is the center of a 3-star. To be the center of a 3-star, a node must have exactly three adjacent nodes (leaves).

- Node 0 has 4 adjacent nodes (1, 3, 4, 5), so it's not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 adjacent nodes (0, 5), so it's not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 adjacent node (3), so it's not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 adjacent nodes (0, 2, 2), so it's the center of a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 4)>.
- Node 4 has 2 adjacent nodes (0, 7), so it's not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 adjacent nodes (0, 1, 8), so it's the center of a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 1 adjacent node (7), so it's not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 adjacent nodes (4, 6, 8), so it's the center of a 3-star: <7, (4, 6, 8)>.
- Node 8 has 2 adjacent nodes (5, 7), so it's not the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
