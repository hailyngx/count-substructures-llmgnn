Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with only one edge, as these nodes can be part of a 3-star graph.

The nodes with single edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 with edges (0, 8) and (0, 9)
- Node 5 with edges (5, 7) and (5, 8)
- Node 6 with edge (6, 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (8, 9)>
2. <5, (7, 8)>
3. <6, (2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
