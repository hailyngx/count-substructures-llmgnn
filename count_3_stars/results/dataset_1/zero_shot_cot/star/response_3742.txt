Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three neighbors.

The nodes with three neighbors are:
- Node 1 with neighbors 2, 3, and 4
- Node 3 with neighbors 1, 4, and 5
- Node 4 with neighbors 1, 3, and 6
- Node 7 with neighbors 1, 4, and 6

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
