Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 8, 4)>
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>
