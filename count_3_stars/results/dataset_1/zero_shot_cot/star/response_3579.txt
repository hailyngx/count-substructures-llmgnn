Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.  
Here are the connections for each node:  
Node 0: 6, 8  
Node 1: 3, 4, 8  
Node 2: 7  
Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8  
Node 4: 1, 3, 5  
Node 5: 4, 8  
Node 6: 0, 7  
Node 7: 2, 3, 6  
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.  
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to find the number of 3-stars for each node and sum them up.  

Let's calculate for each node:  
Node 0: 0 three-star  
Node 1: 1 three-star <1, (3, 4, 8)>  
Node 2: 0 three-star  
Node 3: 1 three-star <3, (1, 4, 8)>  
Node 4: 1 three-star <4, (1, 3, 5)>  
Node 5: 0 three-star  
Node 6: 0 three-star  
Node 7: 0 three-star  
Node 8: 1 three-star <8, (1, 3, 5)>  

Adding them up: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4  
Hence, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
   
<1, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>
