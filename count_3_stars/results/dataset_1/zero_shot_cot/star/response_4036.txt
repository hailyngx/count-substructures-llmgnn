Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in any 3-star. To be a part of a 3-star, a node needs to have exactly 3 edges connected to it.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

For Node 0:
- (0, 1, 2)
- (0, 4, 5)
- (0, 5, 6)
- (0, 6, 9)
So, Node 0 forms 4 different 3-stars.

For Node 4:
- (4, 0, 5)
- (4, 5, 6)
- (4, 6, 8)
Node 4 forms 3 different 3-stars.

For Node 6:
- (6, 0, 3)
- (6, 0, 4)
- (6, 0, 5)
- (6, 0, 9)
- (6, 3, 7)
- (6, 4, 5)
- (6, 4, 7)
- (6, 5, 7)
- (6, 7, 8)
- (6, 8, 9)
Node 6 forms 10 different 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 3 + 10] = [17].
  
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
