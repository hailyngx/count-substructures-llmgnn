Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 8, not connected)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
8. <7, (1, 3, not connected)>
9. <8, (0, 6, not connected)>
10. <9, (4, 5, not connected)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
