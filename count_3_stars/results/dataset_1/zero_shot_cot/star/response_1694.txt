Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Start by identifying all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them as potential centers for the 3-stars.
   - Node 8 is connected to 6 other nodes (0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9).
   - Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 1, 8).
   - Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 2, 7).
   These are the potential centers.

2. For each potential center, identify the nodes that are connected to it by an edge to form the 3-stars.
   - For center node 8: (0, 3, 6), (0, 4, 7), (0, 9, 1), (3, 6, 5), (4, 7, 9), (6, 9, 2), (1, 7, 2) -> 7 possible 3-stars.
   - For center node 3: (0, 8, 1) -> 1 possible 3-star.
   - For center node 9: (1, 2, 7) -> 1 possible 3-star.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 9, 1)>, <8, (3, 6, 5)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 9, 2)>, <8, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (0, 8, 1)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>.

Count of 3-stars: [9]
