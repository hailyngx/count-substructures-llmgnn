Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the given edges, we can determine the following 3-star patterns:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 'missing_leaf')>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 'missing_leaf', 'missing_leaf')>
<5, (0, 6, 'missing_leaf')>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 'missing_leaf')>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 'missing_leaf')>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
