Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

Now, let's go through the nodes one by one and identify the unique 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (8, 9, 0)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 8, 0)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Hence, we have identified the unique 3-stars present in the given graph. Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
