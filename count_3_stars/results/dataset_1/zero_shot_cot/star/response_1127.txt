Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. This forms a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 5)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 8. This does not form a 3-star as there are not enough connections.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 7. This does not form a 3-star as there are not enough connections.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <3, (6, 9)> and <3, (9, 6)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9, forming two 3-stars: <4, (0, 5, 7)> and <4, (0, 5, 9)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <5, (0, 4, 6)> and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <6, (3, 5, 8)> and <6, (3, 5, 9)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8. This forms a 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (2, 4, 8)>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (1, 6, 7)>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6. This forms two 3-stars: <9, (3, 4, 5)> and <9, (3, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5)>, <3, (6, 9)>, <3, (9, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
