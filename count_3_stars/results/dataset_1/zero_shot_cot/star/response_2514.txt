Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Observations:
- Nodes with degree 3 are potential centers of 3-stars.
- For each node with degree 3, the three connected neighbors of that node form a 3-star with that node as the center.

Identifying the nodes with degree 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
