Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes connected to each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We can observe the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Count: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
