Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (2, 4, 4)>
- 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (3, 5, -)>
- 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (5, 9, -)>
- 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (4, 9, -)>
- 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
