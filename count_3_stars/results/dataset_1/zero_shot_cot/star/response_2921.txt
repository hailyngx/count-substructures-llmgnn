Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected in the specific 3-star pattern. In a 3-star, one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9: <4, (1, 5, 9)>
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4: <5, (0, 1, 4)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5: <6, (0, 2, 5)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
