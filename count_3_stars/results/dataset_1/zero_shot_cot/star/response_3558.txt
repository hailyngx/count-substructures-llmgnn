Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of each 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that are connected to three other nodes each. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 8 and 4 are connected to three other nodes each: 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.

Now we can build the 3-stars using nodes 8 and 4 as the central nodes:

1. <8, (0, 3, 7)>
2. <8, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <8, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <8, (3, 4, 6)>
5. <8, (3, 4, 7)>
6. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
7. <4, (8, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
