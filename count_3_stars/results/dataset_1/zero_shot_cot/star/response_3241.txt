Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the potential 3-stars. These are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

The central nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 7, 8, 9)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 4, 5, 9)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 4, 7, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 7)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 6)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 3)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 4)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
