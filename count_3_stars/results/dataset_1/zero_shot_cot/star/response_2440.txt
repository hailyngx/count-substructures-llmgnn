Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we analyze each node to determine if it's the center of a 3-star graph. **A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.** 

Now, let's find all the 3-stars present in the graph.

1. Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star (degree is 1)
2. Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 4)>
3. Node 2: Not a center of a 3-star (degree is 1)
4. Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star (degree is 1)
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
6. Node 5: Not a center of a 3-star (degree is 1)
7. Node 6: <6, (1, 4, 2)>
8. Node 7: Not a center of a 3-star (degree is 1)
9. Node 8: Not a center of a 3-star (degree is 1)
10. Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star (degree is 1)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (5, 6, 4)> and <6, (1, 4, 2)>. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
