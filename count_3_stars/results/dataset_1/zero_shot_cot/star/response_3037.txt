Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 8, 0)>
<9, (2, 6, 0)>

Therefore, there are [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
