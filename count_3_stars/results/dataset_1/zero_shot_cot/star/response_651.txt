Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 adjacent nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 5)>
<5, (0, 8, 4)>
<6, (7, 9, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars shown above, the total count is [9].
