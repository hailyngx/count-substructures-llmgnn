Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has 2 edges: (0, 1) and (0, 7). It forms one 3-star: <0, (1, 7)>.

2. Node 1 has 6 edges: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), and (1, 6). It forms three 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, and <1, (3, 4, 6)>.

3. Node 2 has 1 edge: (2, 8). It does not form any 3-stars since it needs to have exactly 3 edges.

4. Node 3 has 2 edges: (3, 1) and (3, 6). It forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 6)>.

5. Node 4 has 2 edges: (4, 1) and (4, 8). It forms one 3-star: <4, (1, 8)>.

6. Node 5 has 1 edge: (5, 8). It does not form any 3-stars since it needs to have exactly 3 edges.

7. Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 1), (6, 3), and (6, 9). It forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 9)>.

8. Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 0), (7, 1), and (7, 8). It forms one 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 8)>.

9. Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), and (8, 7). It forms one 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 5)>.

10. Node 9 has 1 edge: (9, 6). It does not form any 3-stars since it needs to have exactly 3 edges.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6)>, <4, (1, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>.
