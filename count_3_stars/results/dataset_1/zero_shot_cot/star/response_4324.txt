Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the given edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (4, 9, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 6)>
- <9, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
