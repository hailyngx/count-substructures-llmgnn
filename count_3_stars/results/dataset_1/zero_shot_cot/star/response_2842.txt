Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by identifying nodes with exactly three neighbors to determine the 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 1, 7)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 6, 8)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 4, 5)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 2, 3)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 2, 6, 7)

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [5]
