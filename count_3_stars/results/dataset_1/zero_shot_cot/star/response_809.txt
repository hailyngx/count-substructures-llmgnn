Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by determining the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 0:
- Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8

Node 1:
- Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7

Node 3:
- Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8

Node 7:
- Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9

Node 8:
- Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5

Now we can list the 3-stars we found:

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
