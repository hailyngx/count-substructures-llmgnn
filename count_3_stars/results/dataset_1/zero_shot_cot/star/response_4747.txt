Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
