Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can visualize the 3-stars by identifying the central node and the leaves connected to it.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, -)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
