Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 8)>
<5, (8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [6]
