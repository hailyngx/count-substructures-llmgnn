Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the unique 3-stars present.

The possible 3-star configurations can be represented as follows:
- <0, (3, 4, x)>
- <1, (4, 7, x)>
- <3, (0, 4, x)>
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (3, x, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7, x)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, x)>
- <8, (7, x, x)>
- <9, (4, x, x)>

Now let's count the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star configuration:
- <0, (3, 4, x)>: 1
- <1, (4, 7, x)>: 1
- <3, (0, 4, x)>: 1
- <4, (1, 3, 6)>: 1
- <4, (3, x, 9)>: 1
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>: 1
- <6, (4, 7, x)>: 1
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>: 1
- <7, (6, 8, x)>: 1
- <8, (7, x, x)>: 1
- <9, (4, x, x)>: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, x)>, <1, (4, 7, x)>, <3, (0, 4, x)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, x, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, x)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, x)>, <8, (7, x, x)>, <9, (4, x, x)>.
