Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of our 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5)

Next, we identify the 3-stars by listing the unique combinations of nodes around these center nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
