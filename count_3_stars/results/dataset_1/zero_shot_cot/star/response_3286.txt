Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since each 3-star has a central node and three leaf nodes, we can identify them based on this pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
   <0, (3, 6, 7)>
   <0, (3, 6, 9)>
   <0, (3, 7, 9)>

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
   <3, (0, 2, 5)>
   <3, (0, 5, 7)>
  
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
   <4, (1, 2, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [6] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
