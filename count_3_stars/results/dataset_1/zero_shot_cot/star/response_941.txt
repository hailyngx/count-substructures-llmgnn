Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star will have exactly three edges connected to it. Let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given edges:
- Node 0 has 8 edges connected to it.
- Nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7 have 5 edges connected to each of them.
- Nodes 3 and 8 have 4 edges connected to each of them.
- Nodes 2, 6, and 9 have 3 edges connected to each of them.

Since 3-stars have the center connected to exactly 3 nodes, we can start by looking at the nodes with 3 edges connected to them. These nodes have the potential to be the center of a 3-star.

Identifying the 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)> (Since node 2 has exactly 3 edges)
- <6, (0, 4, 9)> (Since node 6 has exactly 3 edges)
- <9, (1, 5, 8)> (Since node 9 has exactly 3 edges)

Count of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>
