Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center node of each potential 3-star in the graph. The center node will have exactly three edges connected to it. 

Upon examining the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 5 qualify as potential center nodes. Now, let's look at the neighboring nodes of each center and identify the 3-stars:

1. For center node 1:
   - <1, (0, 5, 2)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 8)>

2. For center node 4:
   - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 8)>

3. For center node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <5, (4, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
