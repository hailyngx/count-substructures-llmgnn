Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 --- 7           2 --- 9
|                 | 
7 --- 3     9 --- 6
|     |     |     |
        1          4 --- 5 --- 8
```  

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[The answer is 5]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 4, 5)>
