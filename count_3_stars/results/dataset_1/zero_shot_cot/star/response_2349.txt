Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6  
- Node 2 is connected to node 6  
- Node 3 is connected to node 9  
- Node 4 is connected to node 8  
- Node 5 is connected to node 6  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7  
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 3

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:  
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 2)>
- <6, (1, 5, 2)>
- <7, (0, 8, 4)>
- <8, (4, 7, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, there are total of [6] 3-stars.  
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
