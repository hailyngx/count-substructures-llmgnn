Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes connected to each node to see if there are any 3-stars. 
The list of nodes connected to each node is as follows:
1: 7
2: 7, 9
3: 6, 8
4: 6, 7
5: 8
6: 3, 4, 9
7: 1, 2, 4, 9
8: 3, 5
9: 2, 6, 7

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (7, 9, 6)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<9, (2, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
