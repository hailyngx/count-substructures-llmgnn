Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes, satisfying the definition of a 3-star graph.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

For each of the identified nodes (3, 6, 7, 9), we need to check their connections to other nodes to see if they form a 3-star. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 3 has connections to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7. Hence, one 3-star is formed with node 3 as the center and nodes 0, 1, 7 as the leaves. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 6 has connections to nodes 3, 7, 8, 9. Hence, one 3-star is formed with node 6 as the center and nodes 3, 7, 8 as the leaves. <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 has connections to nodes 3, 5, 6, 9. Hence, one 3-star is formed with node 7 as the center and nodes 3, 5, 6 as the leaves. <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 has connections to nodes 6, 7, 8. Hence, one 3-star is formed with node 9 as the center and nodes 6, 7, 8 as the leaves. <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Step 3: Compute the total number of 3-stars.

The graph contains 4 unique 3-stars. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

Final answer: [4]
