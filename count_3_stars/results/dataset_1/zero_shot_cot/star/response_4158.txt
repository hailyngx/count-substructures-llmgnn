Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <2, (5, 7, -)>
3. <3, (1, 5, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 5, 7)>
5. <5, (2, 3, 4)>
6. <6, (5, -, -)>
7. <7, (2, 3, 4)>
8. <8, (1, -, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
