Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's first identify all 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 3, -)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 5, -)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
