Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1)>
<6, (7)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are 9 unique 3-stars present in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
