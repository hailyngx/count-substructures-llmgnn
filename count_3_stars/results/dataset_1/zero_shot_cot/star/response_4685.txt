Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding the number of nodes in the graph that serve as the center of a 3-star.

2. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be considered as the center of a 3-star.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 6,  )>

Counting the 3-stars, we have found 8 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
