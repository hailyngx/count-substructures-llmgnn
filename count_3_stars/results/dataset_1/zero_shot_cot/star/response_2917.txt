Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's start by going through each node and checking if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 4), <1, (0, 4, 9)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 3), <2, (0, 3, 8)>
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 6), <3, (2, 6, 8)>
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 7), <4, (1, 7, 8)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star
7. Node 6: (6, 3, 9), <6, (3, 9, 8)>
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 4), <7, (0, 4, 5)>
9. Node 8: (8, 2, 3), <8, (2, 3, 4)>
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 6), <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>.
