Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present.  
Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>  
<1, (2, 3, 5)>  
<2, (0, 1, 4)>  
<4, (2, 3, 5)>  
<5, (0, 1, 4)>  
<8, (0, 4, 7)>  
<9, (2, 4, 8)>  

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [7].
