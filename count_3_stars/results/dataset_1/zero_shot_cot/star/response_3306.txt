Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible triangles formed by selecting one central node and three leaves. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can simply look for nodes with exactly three neighbors.

Based on the provided information, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 3, 5)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 6, 7)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 3, 5)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 3, 7, 8)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 4, 8)

Therefore, the only 3-stars present in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 8)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
