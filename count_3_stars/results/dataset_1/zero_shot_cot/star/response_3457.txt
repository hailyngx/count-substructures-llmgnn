Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star.

1. The central node must have exactly 3 neighbors connected by edges in order to form a 3-star.
2. Once we identify a central node, we need to check if each pair of its neighbors is connected by an edge to confirm the presence of a 3-star.

Let's go step-by-step:

First, let's list out all the nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to 0.
- Node 3 is connected to 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to 3, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 and 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 7, 8)> - Node 0 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
2. <3, (4, 5, 7)> - Node 3 is the central node connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
3. <4, (6, 8, 9)> - Node 4 is the central node connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
4. <6, (0, 5, 8)> - Node 6 is the central node connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
5. <7, (0, 3, 9)> - Node 7 is the central node connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
6. <8, (0, 4, 6)> - Node 8 is the central node connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-star graphs in the given graph.
