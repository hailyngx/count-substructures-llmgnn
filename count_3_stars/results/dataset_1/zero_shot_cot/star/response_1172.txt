Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the graph, we can see that the potential central nodes are 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8 since they are connected to exactly three other nodes each. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
