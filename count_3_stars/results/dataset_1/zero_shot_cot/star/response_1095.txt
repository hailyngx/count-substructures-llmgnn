Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node.  

Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 9  
Node 1: 6  
Node 2: 4, 5, 8  
Node 3: 0, 6  
Node 4: 2, 5, 7  
Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9  
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5  
Node 7: 0, 4, 5  
Node 8: 2, 9  
Node 9: 0, 5, 8  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.  

[2]

<0, (3, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
