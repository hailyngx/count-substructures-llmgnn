Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars, which consist of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 7
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3

Given the definition of a 3-star, we need to look for nodes with degree 3 or more to serve as the center of the 3-star.

Next, we identify the unique 3-star structures in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
