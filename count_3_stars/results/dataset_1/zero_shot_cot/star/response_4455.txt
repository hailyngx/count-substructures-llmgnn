Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star pattern. 

The possible 3-star patterns can have the center node connected to three specific nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-star patterns in the given graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Since the 3-stars are unique, we don't need to repeat the same pattern. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
