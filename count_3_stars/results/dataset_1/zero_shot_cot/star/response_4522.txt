Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph, which are as follows:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, )>
<2, (8, )>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, )>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
