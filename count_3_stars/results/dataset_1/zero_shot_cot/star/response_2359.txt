Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are potential central nodes. In this case, node 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are potential central nodes.

Next, we will check each potential central node to see if they form a 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each potential central node:

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (7, 8, 6)>

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 6:
- <6, (2, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 6)>
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
