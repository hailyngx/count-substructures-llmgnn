Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-star graphs. 

- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes: 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to 2 other nodes: 4 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes: 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 2, 8, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes: 3 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 2 other nodes: 0 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to 1 other node: 1.
- Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 3, and 6.

Now, we can identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (4, 8, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (3, 8, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
