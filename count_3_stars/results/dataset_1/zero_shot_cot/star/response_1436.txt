Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as they have the potential to be the center of a 3-star.  
Nodes with degree 3: Node 5, Node 6, Node 7

Now, let's check all possible 3-stars with these nodes as centers:

1. Node 5 as the center:
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>

2. Node 6 as the center:
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>

3. Node 7 as the center:
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
