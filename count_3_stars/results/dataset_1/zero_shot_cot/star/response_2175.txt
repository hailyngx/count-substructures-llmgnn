Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star pattern. 
Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3 in this graph. 

Nodes with degree 3: 2, 4, 5, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. From node 2: (2, 0, 5, 7)
2. From node 4: (4, 1, 9, 5)
3. From node 5: (5, 2, 9, 4)
4. From node 9: (9, 1, 4, 5)

Therefore, we have found all the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 9, 5)>, <5, (2, 9, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
