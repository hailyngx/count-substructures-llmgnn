Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Number of 3-stars found: [3]

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
