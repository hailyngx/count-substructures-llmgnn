Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. 3-stars have a center node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the central nodes: 

- Central nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 

Now, let's find the leaves of each 3-star by considering the neighbors of each central node. 

For central node 1:
- Leaves: 5, 7, 8

For central node 3:
- Leaves: 4, 8, 9

For central node 4:
- Leaves: 3, 5, 7

For central node 5:
- Leaves: 1, 4, 6

For central node 7:
- Leaves: 1, 4, 5

For central node 9:
- Leaves: 2, 3, 8

Now, let's construct the 3-stars:
<1, (5, 7, 8)> 
<3, (4, 8, 9)> 
<4, (3, 5, 7)> 
<5, (1, 4, 6)> 
<7, (1, 4, 5)> 
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we have a total of 6 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
