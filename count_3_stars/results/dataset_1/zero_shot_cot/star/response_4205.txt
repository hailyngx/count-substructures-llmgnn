Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by looking at each node and its connections:

- Node 0 is connected to node 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7.

We see that only nodes 9, 3, and 7 have degree 3, meaning they are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

- <3, (6, 9, 7)>
- <7, (0, 9, 3)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
