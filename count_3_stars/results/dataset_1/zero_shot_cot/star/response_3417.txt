Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- 3-star 1: <0, (6, 9)>
- 3-star 2: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- 3-star 3: <4, (5, 9)>
- 3-star 4: <5, (4, 7)>
- 3-star 5: <6, (0, 9)>
- 3-star 6: <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- 3-star 7: <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are 7 3-stars in the given graph. The answer is [7].
