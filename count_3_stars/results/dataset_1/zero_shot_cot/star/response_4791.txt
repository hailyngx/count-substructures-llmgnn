Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
