Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4: (2, 9, 5)
2. Node 5: (0, 9, 6)
3. Node 6: (2, 8, 7)
4. Node 8: (2, 9, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
