Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 9}
- Node 8: {5}
- Node 9: {1, 7}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[6]

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, x)> (x can be 1 or 3 or 6)
<2, (5, 6, x)> (x can be 2 or 4)
<3, (4, 6, x)> (x can be 0 or 6)
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 9, x)> (x can be 1 or 3 or 4)
