Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <8, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <1, (6, 7, )*>
6. <6, (1, 7, 8)>
7. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
8. <5, (2, 7, )>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found above:
[8]
