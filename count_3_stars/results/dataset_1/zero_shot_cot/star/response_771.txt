Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. Let's list them:

Central nodes: 0, 3, 4, 8 

Next, for each central node, let's identify the leaves connected to them:

For central node 0:
Leaves: 1, 2, 6
<0, (1, 2, 6)>

For central node 3:
Leaves: 1, 4, 5
<3, (1, 4, 5)>

For central node 4:
Leaves: 3, 9
<4, (3, 9)>

For central node 8:
No 3-stars exist for central node 8.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 9)>
