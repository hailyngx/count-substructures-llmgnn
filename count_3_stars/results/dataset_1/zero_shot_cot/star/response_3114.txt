Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes directly. Since each 3-star requires a central node and three leaf nodes, we need to examine each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 1, 9)>
<1, (4, 0, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 8)>
<7, (0, 9, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
