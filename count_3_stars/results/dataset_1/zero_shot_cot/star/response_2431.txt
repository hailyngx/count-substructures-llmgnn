Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (2, 5, 9)>

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (2, 6, 9)>

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 1, 6)>

4. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 4, 7)>

5. For node 6:
   - <6, (1, 2, 7)>

6. For node 7:
   - <7, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
