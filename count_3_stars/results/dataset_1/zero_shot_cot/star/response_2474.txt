Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list down all possible 3-stars by examining each node as the center node:
- Center node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 7)
- Center node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 6)
- Center node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 1, 5), (2, 1, 6)
- Center node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 4)
- Center node 4: (4, 0, 3)
- Center node 5: (5, 1, 2)
- Center node 6: (6, 1, 2)
- Center node 7: (7, 0, 9)
- Center node 9: (9, 7, 0)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars inside <>:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 9, 7)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
