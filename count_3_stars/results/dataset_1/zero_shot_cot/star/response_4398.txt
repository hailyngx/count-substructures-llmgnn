Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

[<0, (3, 8, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 0)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 0)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
