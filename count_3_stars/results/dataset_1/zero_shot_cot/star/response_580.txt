Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 9, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 0)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars we found, we get [10].
