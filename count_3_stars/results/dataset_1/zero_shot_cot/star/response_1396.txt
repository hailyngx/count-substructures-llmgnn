Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph: 

<2, (4, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 4)>
<8, (2, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
