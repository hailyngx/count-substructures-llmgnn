Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with 3 connections (degree 3) as potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
In this graph, nodes 2, 3, and 6 have degree 3.

Step 2: For each potential central node, determine the nodes connected to it. 
- For node 2: (2, 3, 6, 8)
- For node 3: (3, 2, 7, 8)
- For node 6: (6, 1, 2, 7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars using the central nodes and their connections.
- For node 2: There is only one 3-star <2, (3, 6, 8)>.
- For node 3: There is only one 3-star <3, (2, 7, 8)>.
- For node 6: There is only one 3-star <6, (1, 2, 7)>.

[The total number of 3-stars is 3, therefore the final answer is [3].]
