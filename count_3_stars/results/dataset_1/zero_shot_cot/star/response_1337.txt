Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars around a central node. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

2. For each node, identify the edges connected to it:
Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5)
Node 1: (1, 8)
Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9)
Node 3: (3, 9)
Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7)
Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9)
Node 6: (6, 5)
Node 7: (7, 4)
Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5)
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5)

3. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Based on the edges, we can find the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
