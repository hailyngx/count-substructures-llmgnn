Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to 2, 4. Therefore, node 0 cannot form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Node 1 is connected to 2, 4, 5. Therefore, node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 5)>.

3. Node 2 is connected to 0, 1, 7, 9. Therefore, node 2 cannot form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

4. Node 3 is connected to 4, 5, 6. Therefore, node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>.

5. Node 4 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9. Therefore, node 4 cannot form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

6. Node 5 is connected to 1, 3, 9. Therefore, node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>.

7. Node 6 is connected to 3, 9. Therefore, node 6 cannot form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

8. Node 7 is connected to 2, 4, 8, 9. Therefore, node 7 cannot form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

9. Node 8 is connected to 4, 7. Therefore, node 8 cannot form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

10. Node 9 is connected to 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. Therefore, node 9 cannot form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
