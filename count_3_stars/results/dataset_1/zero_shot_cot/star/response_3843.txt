Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes.  
Based on the given edges, we can identify the following central nodes and their adjacent nodes:  
- Central node 0 is adjacent to node 9.
- Central node 1 is adjacent to nodes 4 and 8.
- Central node 2 is adjacent to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Central node 3 is adjacent to node 6.
- Central node 4 is adjacent to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Central node 5 is adjacent to nodes 2 and 9.
- Central node 6 is adjacent to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- Central node 7 is adjacent to nodes 4 and 6.
- Central node 8 is adjacent to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Central node 9 is adjacent to nodes 0, 5, and 8.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.  
To find 3-stars, we need to look for central nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes.

<2, (4, 5, 6)>  
<6, (2, 3, 7)>  
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
