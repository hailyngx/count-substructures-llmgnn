Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars.  
From the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to 4, 6, 7)
- Node 1 (connected to 6, 7)
- Node 3 (connected to 6, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to 0, 7)
- Node 5 (connected to 2, 6)
- Node 8 (connected to 2, 3, 7)

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes.  
For Node 0:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7. 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>

For Node 1:
- Node 1 does not form a 3-star with its connected nodes.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star with its connected nodes.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7. 
<4, (0, 6, 7)>

For Node 5:
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star with its connected nodes.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star with its connected nodes.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (4, 6, 7)>  
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
