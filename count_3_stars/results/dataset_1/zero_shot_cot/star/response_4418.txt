Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The possible 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, -)>
<7, (4, -, -)>
<8, (2, 6, -)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
