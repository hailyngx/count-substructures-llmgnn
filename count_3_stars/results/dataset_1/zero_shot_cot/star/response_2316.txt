Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique occurences where a node is connected to three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
