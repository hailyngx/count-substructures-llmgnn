Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:
Node 0: 8
Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 1, 8
Node 4: 9
Node 5: 1
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 1, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 9: 4

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph.
