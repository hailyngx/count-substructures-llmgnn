Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have 3 outgoing edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with 3 outgoing edges in the given graph:
- Node 0 has 3 outgoing edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8)
- Node 2 has 3 outgoing edges: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5)
- Node 5 has 4 outgoing edges: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7)
- Node 4 has 3 outgoing edges: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9)

Therefore, there are 3-stars centered at nodes 0, 2, and 4. 

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
- <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
