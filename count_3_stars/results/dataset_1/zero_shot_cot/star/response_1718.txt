Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The possible 3-stars can have central nodes (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9) with three leaves each. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (3, 4, 8)>
6. <6, (2, 4, 7)>
7. <7, (0, 2, 9)>
8. <9, (0, 3, 7)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
