Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (6, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 1, 6)>

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
