Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph.

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
