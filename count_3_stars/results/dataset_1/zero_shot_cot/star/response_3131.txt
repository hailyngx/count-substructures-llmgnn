Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 1, 5, 4, 7

Step 2: For each of these nodes, count the number of 3-stars they are a part of.
    
    For node 1:
        Number of 3-stars with node 1 as center = 2
        <1, (0, 4, 5)>
        <1, (5, 4, 7)>
    
    For node 5:
        Number of 3-stars with node 5 as center = 3
        <5, (1, 4, 7)>
        <5, (2, 4, 7)>
        <5, (1, 2, 7)>
    
    For node 4:
        Number of 3-stars with node 4 as center = 2
        <4, (1, 5, 6)>
        <4, (1, 6, 7)>
    
    For node 7:
        Number of 3-stars with node 7 as center = 2
        <7, (1, 5, 6)>
        <7, (3, 5, 6)>

Step 3: Add up the number of 3-stars for each node.
   
    Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
