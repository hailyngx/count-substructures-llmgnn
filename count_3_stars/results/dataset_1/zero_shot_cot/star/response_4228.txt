Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs present in the given graph:

<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
