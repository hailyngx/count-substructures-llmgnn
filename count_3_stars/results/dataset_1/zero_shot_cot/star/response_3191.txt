Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph.

First, let's list all the possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided:
- Possible centers: 0, 3, 7
- Leaves connected to center 0: 2, 5, 6
- Leaves connected to center 3: 5, 6, 8
- Leaves connected to center 7: 8, 9

Now let's count the number of 3-stars for each center:
- For center 0: (0, 2, 5, 6)
- For center 3: (3, 5, 6, 8)
- For center 7: (7, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (8, 9)>
