Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 8, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 7)>
5. <5, (2, 6, 8)>
6. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [6]
