Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
   <0, (4, 8)>
   
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
   <1, (4, 6, 9)>
   
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
   <2, (4, 5)>
   
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
   <3, (5, 7)>
   
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 9.
   <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   <4, (0, 5, 9)>
   
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
   <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   <6, (1, 8)>
  
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
   <8, (0, 6, 9)>
   
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
   <9, (1, 4, 8)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
