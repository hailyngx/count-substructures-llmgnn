Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central Node: 0, Leaves: 3, 8, 9
2. Central Node: 3, Leaves: 0, 4, 9
3. Central Node: 4, Leaves: 3, 6, 9
4. Central Node: 5, Leaves: 2, 6, 9
5. Central Node: 6, Leaves: 4, 5, 9
6. Central Node: 7, Leaves: 1, 6, 8
7. Central Node: 8, Leaves: 0, 7, 9
8. Central Node: 9, Leaves: 0, 5, 6

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 

<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>
