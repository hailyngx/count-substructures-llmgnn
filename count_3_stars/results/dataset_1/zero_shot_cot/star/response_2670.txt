Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center nodes in the graph. These are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Let's list the nodes along with the number of edges each node is incident to:
- Node 0: 5 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 5: 3 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 5 edges
- Node 8: 1 edge
- Node 9: 1 edge

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
