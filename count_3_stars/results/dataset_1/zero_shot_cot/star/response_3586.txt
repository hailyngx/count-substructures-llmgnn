Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
