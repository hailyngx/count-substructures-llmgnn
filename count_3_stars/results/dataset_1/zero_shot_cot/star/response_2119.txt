Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Since the center of a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can list all the nodes with 3 edges originating from them:
- Node 0: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9)

2. Counting the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 5: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 4: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 9: <5, (0, 1, 9)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 3]
