Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1 and 3.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star. We'll list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

- From Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- From Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- From Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 8)>

Finally, counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get [3].
