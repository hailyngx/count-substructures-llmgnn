Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences of 3-stars. A 3-star is formed when the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
2. <6, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <9, (2, 4, 5)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [3].
