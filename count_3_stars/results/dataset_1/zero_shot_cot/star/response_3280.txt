Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
   <0, (2, 6, 8)>

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
   <1, (2, 4, 5)>

3. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
   <5, (1, 3, 9)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
