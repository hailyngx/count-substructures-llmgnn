Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can see that the central node of a 3-star will have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
