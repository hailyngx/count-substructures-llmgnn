Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three neighbors. In this case, nodes 0, 3, and 5 are the central nodes.

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph using the central nodes identified:
- From node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have found 8 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
