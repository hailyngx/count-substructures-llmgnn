Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to the central node to form a 3-star. 

For each node in the graph, we will check if it has exactly three edges connected to it. If it does, we will consider it as the center of a 3-star and list the three connected nodes as the leaves.

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0 has 4 edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7)
- Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- Node 5 has 3 edges: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 9)
- Node 6 has 4 edges: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4)
- Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

[6]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
