Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
