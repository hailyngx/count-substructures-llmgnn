Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 7), (5, 0), (7, 4), (7, 9), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 7)

Number of 3-star graphs: [2]
Unique 3-star graphs:
