Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are adjacent to each node. 

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.  
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.  
Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.   
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.  
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.  
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.  

From the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 6, 8)>  
<1, (4, 7, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4, 6)>  
<3, (5, 6, -)>  
<4, (1, 2, 5)>  
<5, (3, 4, 7)>  
<6, (0, 2, 3)>  
<7, (1, 5, 9)>  
<8, (0, 4, -)>  

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [9].
