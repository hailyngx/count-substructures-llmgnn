Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
   - Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
   - Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
   - Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6
   - Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9
   - Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 8

2. Based on the above analysis, the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7

3. Identify the 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
   - <1, (4, 0, 7)>
   - <1, (7, 0, 4)>
   - <2, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 6)>

4. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
