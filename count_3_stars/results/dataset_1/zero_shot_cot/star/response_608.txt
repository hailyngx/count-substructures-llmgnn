Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them eligible to be the center of a 3-star. 

From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three connections are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 7, and also 1, but this edge is counted twice)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8)

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 1)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are [5] 3-stars in total.
