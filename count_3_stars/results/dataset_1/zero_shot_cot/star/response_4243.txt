Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we will look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars and count them.

1. Node 1 is the center node of the 3-star. (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 7).
   - <1, (3, 5, 7)>

2. Node 3 is the center node of the 3-star. (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7).
   - <3, (1, 4, 7)>

3. Node 4 is the center node of the 3-star. (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5).
   - <4, (2, 3, 5)>

4. Node 8 is the center node of the 3-star. (8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 0).
   - <8, (0, 6, 0)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
