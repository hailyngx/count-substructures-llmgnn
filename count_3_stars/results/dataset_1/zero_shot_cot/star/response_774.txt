Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node in a 3-star graph is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by identifying the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

From the provided edges, the nodes with three incident edges are: 0, 2, 8, and 9. Let's identify the 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 9:
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>.
