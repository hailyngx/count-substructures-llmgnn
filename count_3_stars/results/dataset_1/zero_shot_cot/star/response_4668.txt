Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
    Nodes with three edges: 0, 1, 2, 8

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star.
    For node 0: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) -> <0, (3, 5, 9)>
    For node 1: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) -> <1, (3, 6, 9)>
    For node 2: (2, 3) (2, 7) -> <2, (3, 7, x)> (Not a 3-star as node 2 only has 2 edges)
    For node 8: (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) -> <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars found.
    Number of 3-stars: [2]

Final Answer: [2]
