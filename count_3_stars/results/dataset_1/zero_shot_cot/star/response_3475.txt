Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8
- Node 3: Forms two 3-stars, one with nodes 1, 4, and 5, and another with nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 4: Forms two 3-stars, one with nodes 1, 3, and 8, and another with nodes 3, 5, and 7
- Node 5: Not a center of a 3-star
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and no node (as there's no 4th edge for node 6)
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and no node (as there's no 4th edge for node 7)
- Node 8: Forms two 3-stars, one with nodes 1, 4, and 6, and another with nodes 4, 6, and 9
- Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 8, -)>, and <7, (0, 4, -)>. 

Counting the total, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
