Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star structure.

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>  
<0, (1, 7, 9)>  
<0, (2, 6, 9)>  
<2, (0, 8, 9)>  
<3, (4, 9, 3)>  
<8, (2, 5, 9)>  
<8, (5, 6, 8)>  
<9, (0, 2, 3)>  
<9, (0, 5, 8)>  

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
