Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each central node and count the number of 3-stars it forms. 

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 5)>
<9, (0, 7, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [8].
