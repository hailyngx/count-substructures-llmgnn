Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 4
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3

2. Consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and check if it satisfies the definition:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 3: <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 7, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: No 3-star

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>.
