Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. These central nodes will have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. From the given graph, the central nodes are nodes 0, 2, and 3.

For node 0, the 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
[<0, (1, 2, 3)>]

For node 2, the 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
[<2, (0, 3, 4)>]

For node 3, the 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
[<3, (0, 2, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
