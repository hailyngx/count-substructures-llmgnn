Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes.

The central nodes are nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Let's list the central nodes:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 9)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 5)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)> (1 unique 3-star)
- For node 3: <3, (0, 2, 4)> (1 unique 3-star)
- For node 4: <4, (1, 3, 5)> (1 unique 3-star)
- For node 6: <6, (7, 8, 9)> (1 unique 3-star)
- For node 7: <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)> (4 unique 3-stars)
- For node 9: <9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)> (2 unique 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
