Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their connections which form 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6)
2. Central node 1: (1, 8), (1, 9)
3. Central node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4)
4. Central node 3: (3, 6), (3, 7)
5. Central node 4: (4, 2)
6. Central node 5: (5, 8)
7. Central node 6: (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 9)
8. Central node 7: (7, 3)
9. Central node 8: (8, 1), (8, 5)
10. Central node 9: (9, 1), (9, 6)

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[10] 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 6)>
<1, (8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4)>
<3, (6, 7)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (8)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (3)>
<8, (1, 5)>
<9, (1, 6)>
