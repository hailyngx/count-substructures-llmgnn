Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors:
    - Node 1 has neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}.
    - Node 2 has neighbors {0, 1, 4}.
    - Node 3 has neighbors {6, 8}.
    - Node 4 has neighbors {1, 2}.
    - Node 7 has neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9}.
    - Node 8 has neighbors {1, 3, 9}.
    - Node 9 has neighbors {7, 8}.

2. Check if any of these nodes are part of a 3-star:
    - Nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8 qualify as potential centers for 3-stars.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- For each potential center, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, identify the three connected nodes to form a 3-star.

1. For center node 1:
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 7, 8)>
    - Total: 2

2. For center node 2:
    - No 3-star configurations found.

3. For center node 4:
    - No 3-star configurations found.

4. For center node 7:
    - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
    - Total: 1

5. For center node 8:
    - No 3-star configurations found.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>.
