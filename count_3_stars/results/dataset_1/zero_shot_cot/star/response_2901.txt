Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first find the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
3. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
5. <2, (3, 5, 9)>
6. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
7. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
8. <5, (2, 3, 7)>
9. <7, (0, 5, 6)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
