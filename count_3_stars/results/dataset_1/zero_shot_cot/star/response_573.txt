Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the neighboring nodes for each 3-star pattern.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, -)>
<5, (9, -, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, -)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
