Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 6)
4. Node 3: No 3-star as the degree of node 3 is 4 (more than 3)
5. Node 6: (6, 1, 2)
6. Node 7: No 3-star as the degree of node 7 is 3 (not connected to exactly 3 other nodes)
7. Node 8: No 3-star as the degree of node 8 is 3 (not connected to exactly 3 other nodes)
8. Node 9: (9, 2, 3)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 6)> and <9, (2, 3, 9)>.
