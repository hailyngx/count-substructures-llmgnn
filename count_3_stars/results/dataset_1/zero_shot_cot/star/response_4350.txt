Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.  
In this graph, nodes 2, 3, 4, 5 each have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Step 2: For each identified center node, find the nodes connected to it and form 3-stars.  
For center node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 4, 5)  
For center node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 5, 6)  
For center node 4: (4, 2, 5), (4, 6, 8)  
For center node 5: (5, 1, 7), (5, 2, 4)

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars formed.  
<2, (0, 3, 5)>  
<2, (4, 5, 6)>  
<3, (0, 2, 5)>  
<3, (5, 6, 4)>  
<4, (2, 5, 6)>  
<4, (6, 8, 5)>  
<5, (1, 7, 2)>  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>  

Step 4: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
