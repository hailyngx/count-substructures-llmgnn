Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The graph has 10 nodes, so the possible center nodes for a 3-star are nodes 0 to 9.

For each node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, we will list the unique 3-stars.

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center. 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 6. It is not part of any 3-star since it only has 2 connections.

For node 2: 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center. 
<2, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to node 2. It is not part of any 3-star since it only has 1 connection.

For node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center.
<4, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center.
<5, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center.
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. It is not part of any 3-star since it only has 2 connections.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. It is not part of any 3-star since it only has 2 connections.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center.
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us [9].
