Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star and then count the number of such stars. 

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
