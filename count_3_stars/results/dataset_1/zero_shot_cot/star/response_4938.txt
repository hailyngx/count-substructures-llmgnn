Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9) -> <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    
2. Node 1:
    - (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9) -> <1, (0, 2, 5)>

3. Node 2:
    - (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6) -> <2, (0, 1, 5)>

4. Node 6:
    - (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8) -> <6, (1, 2, 7)>

5. Node 7:
    - (7, 1), (7, 6) -> <7, (1, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
