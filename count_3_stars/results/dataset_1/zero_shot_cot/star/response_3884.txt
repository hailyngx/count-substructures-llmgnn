Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, which are candidates for being the center of a 3-star graph. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 5 have 4 neighbors, nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 neighbors, and nodes 3 and 7 have 4 neighbors. 

Next, let's examine nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9 which have 3 neighbors. Nodes 2 and 6 are not connected to any other nodes with only one edge, and node 8 has one edge connected to node 1, but node 1 is not connected to node 5. Thus, we exclude nodes 2, 6, and 8 from being the center of a 3-star graph.

Now, let's focus on node 9 which is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7. Let's analyze the 3-star graphs that can be formed with node 9 as the center:

1. <9, (0, 3, 7)>
2. <9, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <9, (0, 5, 7)>
4. <9, (3, 5, 7)>

These are the 3-star graphs that can be formed in the given graph. Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4] 3-stars.
