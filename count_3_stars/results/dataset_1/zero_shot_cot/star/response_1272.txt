Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 
For a node to be considered as the center of a 3-star, it must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
<1, (3, 6), (5)>  
<2, (4, 7, 9)>  
<3, (1, 5, 6)>  
<4, (2, 5, 9)>  
<5, (3, 4, 8), (9)>  
<6, (1, 3, 8)>  
<7, (2, 8)>  
<8, (5, 6, 7)>  
<9, (2, 4, 5)>  

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:  
[9]
