Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Given the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0 with neighbors 2, 3, 4, 5: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
