Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

Given that a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the central node and its connected nodes.

In this graph, the 3-star patterns can be found around central nodes with exactly 3 connected nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 3, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 1)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

There are 7 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
