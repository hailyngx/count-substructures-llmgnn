Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph. 

There are three 3-stars in this graph, as follows:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
