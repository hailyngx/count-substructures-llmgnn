Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node and its neighbors. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that match this criteria.

We have the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 9, 0)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9].
