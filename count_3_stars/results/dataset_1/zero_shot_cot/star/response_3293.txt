Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to a single node, which would represent potential central nodes for the 3-stars. 

From the list of edges provided, we can identify the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to node 6
- Node 3 is connected to node 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6

Based on the connections, the potential central nodes are: 0, 3, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: It does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to one node.
- For node 3: It does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to one node.
- For node 6: It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8. <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- For node 8: It does not form a 3-star as it is only connected to one node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
Unique 3-stars in the graph: <<6, (0, 5, 8)>>
