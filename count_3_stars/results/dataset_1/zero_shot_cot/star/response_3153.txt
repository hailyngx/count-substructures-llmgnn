Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 8, -)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Count the number of unique 3-stars: [5]
