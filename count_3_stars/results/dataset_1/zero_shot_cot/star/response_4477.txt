Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 7, 9)
2. Node 2: (2, 5, 7)
3. Node 3: (3, 4, 5)
4. Node 4: (4, 3, 5)
5. Node 5: (5, 2, 3)
6. Node 6: (6, 2, 3)
7. Node 7: (7, 0, 1)
8. Node 9: (9, 0, 3)

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [8]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1)>
<9, (0, 3)>
