Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [4].
