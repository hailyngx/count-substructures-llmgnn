Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
