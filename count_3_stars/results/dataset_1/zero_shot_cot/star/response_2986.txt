Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaf nodes. 

In this graph:
- Node 0 has leaf nodes 3 and 9
- Node 1 has leaf nodes 2, 4, and 8
- Node 2 has leaf nodes 1, 4, and 8
- Node 3 has leaf node 0 and 7
- Node 4 has leaf nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9
- Node 5 has no connections
- Node 6 has no connections
- Node 7 has leaf nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6
- Node 8 has leaf nodes 1, 2, and 9
- Node 9 has leaf nodes 0, 4, and 8

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
