Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 2)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
