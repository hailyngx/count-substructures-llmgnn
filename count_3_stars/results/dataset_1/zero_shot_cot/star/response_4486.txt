Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

To form a 3-star, we need to find a central node which is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, -)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, -)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [7].
