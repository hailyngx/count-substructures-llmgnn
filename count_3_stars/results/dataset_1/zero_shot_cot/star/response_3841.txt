Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by identifying the central nodes of the 3-stars. The central node is connected to three other nodes in a 3-star configuration. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following central nodes: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
