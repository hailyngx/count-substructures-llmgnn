Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<0, (3, 9, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is: [7].
