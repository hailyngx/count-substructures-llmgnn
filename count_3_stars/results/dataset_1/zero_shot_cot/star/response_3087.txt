Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
5. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)>
7. 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (0, 7, 9)>
8. 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (5, 6, 9)>
9. 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (6, 9, -)>
10. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
