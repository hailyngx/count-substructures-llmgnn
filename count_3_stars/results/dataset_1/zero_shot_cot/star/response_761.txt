Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 0)>
4. <3, (4, 8, -)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
6. <5, (9, -, -)>
7. <6, (7, -, -)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 6)>
9. <8, (4, -, -)>
10. <9, (0, 5, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
