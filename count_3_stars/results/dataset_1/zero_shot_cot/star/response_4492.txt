Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list out all the 3-stars based on the given edges:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Now that we have identified all the unique 3-stars, we can count them. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
