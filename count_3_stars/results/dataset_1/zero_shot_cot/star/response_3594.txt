Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Given the edges provided, we can list all the 3-star patterns:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<10, (2, 5, 6)>
<11, (3, 5, 6)>
<12, (6, 9, 3)>
<13, (9, 0, 2)>

Since we have listed all the unique 3-star patterns, we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph based on the number of such unique patterns. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [14].
