Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges, we first need to understand the definition of a 3-star. As mentioned earlier, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Since the graph has a total of 10 nodes, we can start by identifying all the possible 3-star configurations in the graph.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
