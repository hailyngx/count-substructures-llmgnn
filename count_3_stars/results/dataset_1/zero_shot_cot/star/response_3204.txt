Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 2: <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)> and <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- From node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)> and <4, (8, 9, 2)>
- From node 5: <5, (2, 4, 9)> and <5, (8, 2, 4)>
- From node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)> and <8, (9, 4, 2)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 8, 2)> and <9, (8, 5, 2)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified, we have a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
