Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure, i.e., the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, the nodes that can form 3-stars are:  
- Node 1 (connected to 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)  
- Node 2 (connected to 1, 3, 4, 9)  
- Node 9 (connected to 2, 7, 8)  

Let's count the 3-stars now.
