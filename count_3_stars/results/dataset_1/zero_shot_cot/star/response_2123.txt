Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
