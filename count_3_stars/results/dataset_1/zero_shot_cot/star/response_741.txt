Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (3, 6, 8)>
4. <5, (1, 7, -)>
5. <8, (3, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [5]
