Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9, so it is a potential center for 3-stars.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9, so it is a potential center for 3-stars.

Step 2: For each potential center node, identify the adjacent nodes and see if they form a 3-star configuration.
- For node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 9), (0, 3, 9), and (0, 4, 9) are all potential 3-stars.
- For node 5: (5, 3, 7), (5, 3, 9), (5, 7, 9), and (5, 8, 9) are all potential 3-stars.

Step 3: Count the unique 3-star configurations.
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 9, 3)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, and <0, (4, 9, 2)> are the unique 3-stars centered around node 0.
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 9, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, and <5, (8, 9, 7)> are the unique 3-stars centered around node 5.

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8.]
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 9, 3)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 9, 2)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 9, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>
