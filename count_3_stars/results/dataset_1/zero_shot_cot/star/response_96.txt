Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 6, -)>
3. <2, (0, 5, -)>
4. <3, (6, -, -)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
6. <5, (2, 4, -)>
7. <6, (1, 3, -)>
8. <7, (0, 4, 8)>
9. <8, (4, 7, -)>
10. <9, (7, -, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
