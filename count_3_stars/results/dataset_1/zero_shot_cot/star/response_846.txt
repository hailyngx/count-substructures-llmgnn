Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 7, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 3, 4)
- Node 2: (2, 4, 6)
- Node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 7, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 2, 3), (4, 6, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 7, X) (No complete 3-stars centered at node 5)
- Node 6: (6, 2, 4)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 8), (7, 3, 4), (7, 5, X)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 6), (8, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 3, 8)

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [10] 3-stars.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4)>, <2, (4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4)>, <3, (7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3)>, <4, (6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4)>, <7, (0, 8)>, <7, (3, 4)>, <8, (0, 6)>, <8, (7, 9)>, <9, (3, 8)>
