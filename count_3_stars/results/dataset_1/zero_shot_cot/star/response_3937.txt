Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 8)
2. Moving to node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 3, 5)
3. Moving to node 2: (2, 4, 9), (2, 6, 9)
4. Moving to node 3: (3, 1, 7)
5. Moving to node 4: (4, 2, 7)
6. Moving to node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 8), (5, 1, 8), (5, 9, 6)
7. Moving to node 6: (6, 2, 8), (6, 8, 5), (6, 9, 2), (6, 9, 7)
8. Moving to node 7: (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 9), (7, 9, 6)
9. Moving to node 8: (8, 0, 5), (8, 5, 6), (8, 6, 9)
10. Moving to node 9: (9, 2, 6), (9, 5, 6), (9, 6, 8), (9, 7, 4)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)> and <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
