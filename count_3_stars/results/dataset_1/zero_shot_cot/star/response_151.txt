Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Given the information provided, let's first list down all the possible 3-stars by examining each node in the graph as the potential center node:

1. <0, (5, 3, 9)>
2. <1, (8, 2, 7)>
3. <2, (8, 1, 7)>
4. <3, (5, 9, 6)>
5. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
6. <6, (9, 3, 5)>
7. <7, (8, 1, 2)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 7)>
9. <9, (6, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

[9]
