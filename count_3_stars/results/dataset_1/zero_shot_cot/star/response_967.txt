Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

By definition, a 3-star should have a central node (connected to exactly three other nodes) and three leaves connected to this central node. 

Let's list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, -)>  
<1, (2, -,-)>  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (5, 6, -)>  
<2, (6, 0, -)>  
<3, (4, -,-)>  
<4, (3, -,-)>  
<5, (2, 8, -)>  
<6, (2, 8, -)>  
<7, (0, -,-)>  
<8, (5, 6, -)>  

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Finally, the number of 3-stars in the graph is counted as [11].
