Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in this graph: 
  
Step 1: Identify central nodes. The nodes with 3 neighbors are central nodes for potential 3-stars. 
The central nodes are 2, 3, 8, and 9.

Step 2: For each central node, determine its connected leaves to form 3-stars.
For central node 2:
- <2, (0, 3, 0)>
  
For central node 3:
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 9, 8)>
- <3, (8, 4, 9)>
- <3, (9, 4, 3)>
  
For central node 8:
- <8, (3, 7, 3)>
  
For central node 9:
- <9, (3, 4, 3)>
  
[Total number of 3-stars: [5]]  
   
<2, (0, 3, 0)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 9, 8)>
<3, (8, 4, 9)>
<3, (9, 4, 3)>
