Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
5. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
6. <8, (1, 7, 9)>

So, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
