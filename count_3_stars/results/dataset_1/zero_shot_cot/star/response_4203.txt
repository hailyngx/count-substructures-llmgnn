Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 4: (4, 3, 5), (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 9), (4, 7, 6)
- From node 5: (5, 0, 4), (5, 4, 7), (5, 4, 9), (5, 9, 6)
- From node 6: (6, 7, 4), (6, 7, 9), (6, 8, 9), (6, 9, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
