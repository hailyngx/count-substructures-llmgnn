Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars (subgraphs with a center node connected to three other nodes).

Checking all possible combinations of nodes connected to a specific node will help us identify the 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 0: 
  - No 3-star as there are less than three edges connected to node 0.

- For node 1:
  - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <1, (2, 3, 9)>
  - Total: 5

- For node 2:
  - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 3, 9)>
  - Total: 2

- For node 3:
  - <3, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <3, (1, 2, 9)>
  - Total: 2

- For node 4:
  - No 3-star as there are less than three edges connected to node 4.

- For node 5:
  - No 3-star as there are less than three edges connected to node 5.

- For node 6:
  - <6, (0, 1, 3)>
  - Total: 1

- For node 8:
  - <8, (1, 2, 3)>
  - <8, (1, 2, 9)>
  - Total: 2

- For node 9:
  - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
  - Total: 1

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (0, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 9)>, 
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
