Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 9)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 4)>
4. Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
5. Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
6. Node 6: <6, (3, 4, 9)>
7. Node 9: <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
