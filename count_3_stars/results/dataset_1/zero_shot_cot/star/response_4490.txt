Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 6), (4, 5, 6)
- Node 1: (2, 4, 6), (4, 6, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 6)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 9), (0, 4, 8), (1, 4, 8), (4, 7, 8), (4, 8, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 4, 6), (0, 6, 5), (4, 5, 7)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 6), (0, 3, 6), (0, 5, 6), (1, 2, 6), (1, 4, 6)
- Node 7: (4, 5, 7), (4, 7, 8)
- Node 8: (4, 4, 7)
- Node 9: (1, 4, 9)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
