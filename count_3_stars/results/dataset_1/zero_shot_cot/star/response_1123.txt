Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph gives us a total of [5].
