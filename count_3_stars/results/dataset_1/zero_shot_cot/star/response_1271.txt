Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes: 2, 4, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes: 2, 6, 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes: 1, 2, 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

[3]

<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
