Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8: <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 1: <2, (0, 3, 1)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 6: <4, (7, 8, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 9: <5, (7, 6, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 7: <6, (5, 8, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <8, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, you can see that there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph represented above. 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is given inside brackets as [8].
