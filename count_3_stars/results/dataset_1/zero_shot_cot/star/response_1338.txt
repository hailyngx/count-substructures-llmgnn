Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. Let's analyze the given graph's structure based on the provided edges:

1. Node 0: Connected to 4, 7, 9
2. Node 1: Connected to 4, 5, 7
3. Node 2: Connected to 3, 5
4. Node 3: Connected to 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
5. Node 4: Connected to 0, 1, 3
6. Node 5: Connected to 1, 2, 3, 6
7. Node 6: Connected to 5, 7, 8
8. Node 7: Connected to 0, 1, 3, 6
9. Node 8: Connected to 3, 6
10. Node 9: Connected to 0

From the analysis, we can find the following 3-stars:
- From Node 0: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- From Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- From Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)> and <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- From Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [4]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
