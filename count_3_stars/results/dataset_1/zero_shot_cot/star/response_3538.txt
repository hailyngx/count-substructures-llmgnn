Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8
- Node 3 is connected to node 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7

Let's look for 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>.
