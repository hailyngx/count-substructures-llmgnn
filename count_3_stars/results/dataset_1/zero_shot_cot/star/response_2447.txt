Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to node 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph. 

Let's start with the center node 0:
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 7 and 9. So, <0, (7, 9)> is a 3-star.

Moving on to center node 1:
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 6, and 9. So, the possible 3-stars are <1, (3, 6, 9)> and <1, (6, 3, 9)>.

There are a total of `[3]` 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (7, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, and <1, (6, 3, 9)>.
