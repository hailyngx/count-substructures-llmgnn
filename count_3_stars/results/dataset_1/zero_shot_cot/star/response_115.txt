Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 9)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [3]
