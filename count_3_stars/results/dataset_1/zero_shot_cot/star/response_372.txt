Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 8, 0)>
