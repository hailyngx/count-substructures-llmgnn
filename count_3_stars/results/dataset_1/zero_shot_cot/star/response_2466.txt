Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step and list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. From node 0: 
   - <0, (3, 6, 8)>

2. From node 1: 
   - No 3-star configurations possible from node 1.

3. From node 2:
   - No 3-star configurations possible from node 2.

4. From node 3: 
   - <3, (1, 0, 8)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 8)>

5. From node 4:
   - <4, (2, 8, 2)>

6. From node 5:
   - No 3-star configurations possible from node 5.

7. From node 6:
   - No 3-star configurations possible from node 6.

8. From node 8:
   - <8, (4, 3, 4)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 0, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 8, 2)>, 
<8, (4, 3, 4)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 3)>.
