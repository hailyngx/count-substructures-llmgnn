Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
3. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
4. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
5. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
6. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
7. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
8. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
9. <4, (5, 7, 9)>
10. <4, (6, 7, 9)>
11. <5, (3, 4, 7)>
12. <5, (4, 6, 7)>
13. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
14. <6, (0, 5, 8)>
15. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
16. <7, (4, 5, 9)>
17. <8, (0, 2, 6)>
18. <9, (2, 4, 8)>

As we can see, there are 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
