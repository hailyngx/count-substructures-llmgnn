Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph:

<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (7, 9)>
<2, (5, 4)>
<3, (6, 8)>
<4, (5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4)>
<6, (3, 8)>
<7, (1, 9)>
<8, (0, 3)>
<9, (0, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
