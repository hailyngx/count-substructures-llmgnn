Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We have a total of 10 nodes in the graph:
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
And 20 edges:
- (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (7, 4), (8, 0), (8, 6)

Now let's find the 3-stars:

1. From node 4:
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>

2. From node 6:
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
