Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 2)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 1)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
5. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
6. <5, (4)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 0)>
8. <7, (6)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
