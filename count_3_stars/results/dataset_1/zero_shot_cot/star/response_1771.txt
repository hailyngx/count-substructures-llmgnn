Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes are potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Potential central nodes: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9

Step 2: For each potential central node, identify the nodes that are connected to it by edges. Check if these connected nodes are connected to each other to form a 3-star.

3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 0)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (8, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 0, 7)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 2)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [12]

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
