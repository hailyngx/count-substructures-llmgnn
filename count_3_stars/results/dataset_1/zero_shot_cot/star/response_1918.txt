Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by finding the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7) - <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 9) - <1, (5, 9)>
3. Node 2: (2, 8) - Not a 3-star
4. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 7) - Not a 3-star
5. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9) - <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
6. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8) - <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>
7. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9) - <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
8. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9) - <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>, <8, (9, 5, 7)>
9. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8) - <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>, <8, (9, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
