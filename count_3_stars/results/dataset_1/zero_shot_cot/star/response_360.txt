Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A 3-star requires a central node with exactly three edges. Looking at the edges given, nodes 1, 2, and 4 each have 3 edges, making them potential central nodes.

Let's analyze each potential central node:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.

After analyzing, we find that only node 2 meets the criteria of being the central node of a 3-star. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at node 2:
1. Node 2 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.  
   <2, (1, 4, 9)>

Thus, there is one 3-star in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
