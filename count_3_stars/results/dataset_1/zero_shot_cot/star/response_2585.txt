Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars step by step.

Given the nature of a 3-star graph, each 3-star in the graph will have one central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 has edges to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 3, 5, and 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed by these nodes:

1. 3-star with central node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
2. 3-star with central node 3: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
3. 3-star with central node 6: <6, (1, 3, 7)>
4. 3-star with central node 8: <8, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
