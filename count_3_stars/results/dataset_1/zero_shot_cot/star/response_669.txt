Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph representation:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Number of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
