Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

From the analysis, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, )>
<1, (5, , )>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, , )>
<4, (2, 5, )>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, , )>
<7, (3, 8, )>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 6, )>, <1, (5, , )>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, , )>, 
<4, (2, 5, )>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, , )>, <7, (3, 8, )>, 
<8, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 8, )>
