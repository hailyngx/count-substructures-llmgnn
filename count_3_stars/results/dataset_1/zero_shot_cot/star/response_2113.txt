Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the structure of a 3-star graph. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, we can analyze the given graph based on this information:

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
