Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- From nodes 0, 3, 9: <0, (3, 9)>
- From nodes 3, 4, 9: <3, (4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
