Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center which is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7 are candidates for being central nodes. 

Let's examine each potential central node one by one:
1. For node 0:
    - Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
    - Forms 1 unique 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 5)>.
2. For node 1:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
    - Forms 1 unique 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>.
3. For node 5:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
    - Forms 1 unique 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 7)>.
4. For node 7:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 6.
    - Forms 1 unique 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 5)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4, which are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, and <7, (0, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
