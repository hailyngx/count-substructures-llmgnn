Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 are connected to other nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
  - <0, (1, 6)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3.
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
  - <2, (1, 7)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
  - <3, (1, 4, 7)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
  - <6, (0, 7)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
  - <7, (2, 3, 6)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 is not connected to exactly three other nodes, so it is not a center of a 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get: [6].  
Therefore, the answer is [6].
