Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as centers of potential 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3:
   <4, (1, 2, 3)>

2. Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 7:
   <6, (3, 5, 7)>

3. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8:
   <7, (5, 6, 8)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
