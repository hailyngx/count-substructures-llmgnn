Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 8: 1

Now, let's construct the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (0, 3)>
5. <6, (1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
