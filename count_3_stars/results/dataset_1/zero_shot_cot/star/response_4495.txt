Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to find potential 3-stars.  
Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 4, 5  
Now let's check if any of these pairs of nodes have a common neighbor which would form a 3-star with node 0.  

Node pair (1, 4) has a common neighbor: 8  
Node pair (1, 5) has a common neighbor: N/A  
Node pair (4, 5) has a common neighbor: N/A  

So, we have found 1 unique 3-star centered at node 0:  
<0, (1, 4, 8)>  

Now, let's move on to the next node and repeat the same process.  

Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
Node pair (0, 5) has a common neighbor: N/A
Node pair (0, 7) has a common neighbor: N/A
Node pair (0, 8) has a common neighbor: N/A
Node pair (5, 7) has a common neighbor: N/A
Node pair (5, 8) has a common neighbor: 2
Node pair (7, 8) has a common neighbor: N/A

So, we have found 1 unique 3-star centered at node 1:  
<1, (5, 2, 8)>  

Moving on to the next node...  

Nodes connected to node 2: 5, 8  
No 3-star can be formed with node 2.  

Checking node 3...  
Nodes connected to node 3: 4, 7  
No 3-star can be formed with node 3.  

Checking node 4...  
Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8  
No 3-star can be formed with node 4.  

Checking node 5...  
Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7  
No additional 3-star can be formed with node 5.  

Checking node 6...  
Nodes connected to node 6: 4, 8  
No 3-star can be formed with node 6.  

Checking node 7...  
Nodes connected to node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8  
No additional 3-star can be formed with node 7.  

Checking node 8...  
Nodes connected to node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7  
No additional 3-star can be formed with node 8.  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2]  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (1, 4, 8)>  
<1, (5, 2, 8)>
