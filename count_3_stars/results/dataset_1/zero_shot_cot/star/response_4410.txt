Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Nodes with degree 3 are potential centers of 3-stars. In this case, node 2 and node 5 have degree 3.

2. For each potential center node, identify the connected nodes.  
   - For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8)
   - For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2)

3. Count the unique 3-stars:
   - We have one 3-star with center node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
   - We have one 3-star with center node 5: <5, (1, 2)>
