Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3 -> 1 3-star
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8 -> 1 3-star
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 -> 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3],
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9)>
