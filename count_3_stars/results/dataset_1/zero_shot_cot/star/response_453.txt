Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars by finding all the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
