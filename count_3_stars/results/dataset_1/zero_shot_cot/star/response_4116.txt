Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node to form 3-stars. 
Since each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Using the given edges:
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8 (4 edges connected)
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 3, 4, and 5 (3 edges connected)
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 2, 7, and 9 (3 edges connected)
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 2 and 9 (2 edges connected)
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 0, 4, and 8 (3 edges connected)
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 3, 7, and 8 (3 edges connected)
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 3 and 8 (2 edges connected)
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 9 (5 edges connected)
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 4, 5, and 8 (3 edges connected)

From the analysis above, we see that nodes 2, 4, and 7 each have exactly 3 edges connected to them, making them the leaf nodes in our 3-stars.

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
