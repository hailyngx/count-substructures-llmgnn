Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the list of edges, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (6)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
