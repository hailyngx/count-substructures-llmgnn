Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each group of 3 nodes connected in a star pattern with one node at the center and the other two nodes as leaves. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>

Since these are the only unique 3-stars in the given graph, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
