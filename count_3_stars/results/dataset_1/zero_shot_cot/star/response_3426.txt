Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
7. <5, (2, 6, 9)>
8. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
9. <6, (5, 2, 7)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 4)>
11. <9, (5, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
