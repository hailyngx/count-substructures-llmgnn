Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <2, (4, 6, 7)>
5. <3, (1, 2, 8)>
6. <4, (2, 5, 8)>
7. <5, (0, 1, 7)>
8. <8, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
