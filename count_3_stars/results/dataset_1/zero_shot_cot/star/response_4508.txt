Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Possible central nodes: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

Step 2: For each central node, check its neighbors and count the number of 3-stars.

<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
