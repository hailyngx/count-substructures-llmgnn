Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.  Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

Step 1: Look for nodes with exactly three incident edges.
- Nodes with three incident edges are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Step 2: For each node found in Step 1, check if its incident edges form a 3-star configuration.
- For node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), and (2, 7) form a 3-star. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- For node 3: (3, 0), (3, 6), and (3, 8) form a 3-star. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), and (4, 6) form a 3-star. <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), and (5, 7) form a 3-star. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), and (6, 4) form a 3-star. <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- For node 7: (7, 2), (7, 5), and (7, 5) form a 3-star. <7, (2, 5, 5)>
- For node 8: (8, 2), (8, 3), and (8, 2) form a 3-star. <8, (2, 3, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
- There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. Inside brackets, the count of 3-stars is 7. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 5, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 2)>.
