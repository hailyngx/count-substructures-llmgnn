Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's look for 3-stars by checking each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
    - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <0, (7, 8, 9)>

There are 11 unique 3-stars found for node 0.

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
    - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 8)>

    - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 8)>

There are 38 unique 3-stars found for node 8.

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
    - <9, (0, 7, 8)>
    
There is 1 unique 3-star found for node 9.

Counting all unique 3-stars found for each node, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].
