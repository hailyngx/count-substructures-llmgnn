Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node to form a 3-star. The center node should have exactly three neighbors.

Looking at the given edges, we can determine that node 9 is the center node as it has three neighbors: 0, 4, and 7. Now we can list the 3-stars:

1. <9, (0, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (9, x, x)> -- No valid 3-star since node 0 has only one neighbor (9).
3. <1, (5, x, x)> -- No valid 3-star since node 1 has only one neighbor (5).
4. <2, (4, 8, x)>
5. <3, (5, x, x)> -- No valid 3-star since node 3 has only one neighbor (5).
6. <4, (2, 9, x)>
7. <5, (1, 3, 6)>
8. <6, (5, x, x)> -- No valid 3-star since node 6 has only one neighbor (5).
9. <7, (9, x, x)> -- No valid 3-star since node 7 has only one neighbor (9).
10. <8, (2, x, x)> -- No valid 3-star since node 8 has only one neighbor (2).

Counting the valid 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
