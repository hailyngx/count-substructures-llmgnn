Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node as neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 1, 9
- Node 6: 3, 9
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 7

Next, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs (a central node connected to exactly three other nodes):

- <0, (1, 3)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <5, (1, 9)>
- <6, (3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>

As each 3-star subgraph is considered unique, here is the final count:
