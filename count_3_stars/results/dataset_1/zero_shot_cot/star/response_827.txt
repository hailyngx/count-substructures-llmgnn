Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
