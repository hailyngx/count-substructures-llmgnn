Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes that have exactly three edges connecting to them. In this case, the central nodes are nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 0:
    - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <0, (2, 4, 0)>

2. For node 1:
    - <1, (5, 4, 6)>
    - <1, (5, 4, 1)>
    - <1, (5, 4, 0)>

3. For node 3:
    - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 1)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 3)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 0)>

4. For node 9:
    - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <9, (1, 3, 0)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [10].
