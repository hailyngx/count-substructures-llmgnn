Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
