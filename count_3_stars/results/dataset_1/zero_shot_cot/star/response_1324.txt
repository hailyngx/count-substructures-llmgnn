Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the possible unique 3-stars.

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
5. <1, (2, 5, 8)>
6. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
7. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
8. <4, (0, 8, 5)>
9. <6, (1, 3, 9)>
10. <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
