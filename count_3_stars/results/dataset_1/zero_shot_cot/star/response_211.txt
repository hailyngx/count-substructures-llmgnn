Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-star with central node 0: (0, 7, 4)  
- 3-star with central node 1: (1, 6, 9)  
- 3-star with central node 4: (4, 7, 5)  
- 3-star with central node 5: (5, 6, 7)  
- 3-star with central node 7: (7, 0, 4)  
- 3-star with central node 9: (9, 1, 7)  

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Therefore, the answer is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 4, 0)>, <1, (6, 9, 1)>, <4, (7, 5, 4)>, <5, (6, 7, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 7)>, and <9, (1, 7, 9)>.
