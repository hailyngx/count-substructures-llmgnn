Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can act as centers of 3-stars. 

Here are the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0
- Node 5
- Node 8

Now, we can list the 3-stars in the graph using these nodes as centers:

<0, (6, 9, X)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (7, X, X)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
