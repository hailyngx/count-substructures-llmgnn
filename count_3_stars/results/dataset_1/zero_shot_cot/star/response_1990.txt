Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (4, 7, 3)
2. Node 2: (4, 7, 5)
3. Node 3: (1, 5, 7)
4. Node 4: (1, 2, 5)
5. Node 5: (3, 4, 7)
6. Node 7: (1, 2, 3)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 

Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <2, (4, 7, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>.
