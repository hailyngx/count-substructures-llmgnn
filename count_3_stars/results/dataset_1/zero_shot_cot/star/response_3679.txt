Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
