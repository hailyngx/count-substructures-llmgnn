Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's find all 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (3, 9)> - This is a 3-star.

<1, (6)> - This is not a 3-star as it doesn't have exactly 3 leaves.

<2, (8)> - This is not a 3-star as it doesn't have exactly 3 leaves.

<3, (0, 4)> - This is a 3-star.

<4, (3, 5, 8)> - This is a 3-star.

<5, (4)> - This is not a 3-star as it doesn't have exactly 3 leaves.

<6, (1, 9)> - This is not a 3-star as it doesn't have exactly 3 leaves.

<8, (2, 4)> - This is not a 3-star as it doesn't have exactly 3 leaves.

<9, (0, 6)> - This is a 3-star.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars in the graph are <0, (3, 9)>, <3, (0, 4)>, and <4, (3, 5, 8)>.
