Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in this graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 2, 3, and 6 are the central nodes. 

Now we will look at each central node and identify the 3-stars they are a part of:

For node 2:
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
- <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 6:
- <6, (2, 3, 4)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>,
<2, (6, 7, 8)>,
<2, (6, 7, 9)>,
<2, (6, 8, 9)>,
<3, (1, 6, 7)>,
<3, (2, 6, 8)>,
<3, (2, 6, 9)>,
<6, (2, 3, 4)>,
<6, (2, 4, 9)>,
<6, (2, 7, 8)>,
<6, (2, 8, 9)>,
<6, (3, 7, 8)>,
<6, (3, 7, 9)>,
<6, (3, 8, 9)>.
