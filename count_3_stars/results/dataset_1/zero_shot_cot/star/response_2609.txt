Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, -)>
<5, (6, -, -)>

As we can see, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
