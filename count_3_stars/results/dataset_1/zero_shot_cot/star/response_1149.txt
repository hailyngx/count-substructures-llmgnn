Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 4: (0, 4), (3, 4), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9) -> <4, (0, 3, 6)>
2. Node 5: (0, 5), (1, 5), (3, 5), (5, 6) -> <5, (0, 1, 3)>
3. Node 6: (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6) -> <6, (1, 2, 3)>
4. Node 7: (2, 7), (7, 8) -> No 3-star
5. Node 8: (4, 8), (7, 8) -> No 3-star
6. Node 9: (4, 9) -> No 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>.
