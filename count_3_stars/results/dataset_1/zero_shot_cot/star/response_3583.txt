Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 2)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2)>
<8, (3, 5)>
<9, (4, 8)>
<0, (9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [10].
