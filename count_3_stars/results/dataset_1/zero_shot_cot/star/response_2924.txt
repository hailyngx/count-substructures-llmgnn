Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

    - <0, (9, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 9)>
    - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 6, 9)>
    - <5, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <6, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <7, (6, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (9, 9, 9)>
    - <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
