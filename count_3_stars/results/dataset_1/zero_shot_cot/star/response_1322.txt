Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to each node. Then, we look for configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [4].
