Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding adjacent nodes. Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, each central node should be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
