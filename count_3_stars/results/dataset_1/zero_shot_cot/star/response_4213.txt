Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible arrangements where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the 3-stars in this graph:

<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
