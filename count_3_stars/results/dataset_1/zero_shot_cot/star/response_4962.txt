Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would indicate the presence of a 3-star graph. From the given graph, we can see the following nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 2
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 6
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- For node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- For node 2: <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- For node 3: <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- For node 8: <8, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
