Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the graph, we can see the following 3-stars: 
1. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (4, 9, None)>
4. <3, (0, 9, None)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (4, 7, 8)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
8. <7, (1, 5, None)>
9. <8, (5, 6, None)>
10. <9, (2, 3, None)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
