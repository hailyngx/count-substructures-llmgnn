Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
