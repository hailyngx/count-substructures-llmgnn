Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 9, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, and <9, (0, 1, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
