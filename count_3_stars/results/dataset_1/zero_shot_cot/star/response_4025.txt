Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars with their central node and leaf nodes:

<1, (2, 5, 7)>

<3, (0, 1, 4)>

<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

[3]
