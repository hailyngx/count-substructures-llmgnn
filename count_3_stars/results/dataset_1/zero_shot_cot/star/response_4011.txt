Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's begin by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 8, -)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, -, -)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[9]
