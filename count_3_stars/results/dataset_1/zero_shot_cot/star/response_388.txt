Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that have 3 edges each.

Let's identify the nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 0, 8, and 8 (duplicated edge).
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 2, 3, and 5.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 8, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [3].
