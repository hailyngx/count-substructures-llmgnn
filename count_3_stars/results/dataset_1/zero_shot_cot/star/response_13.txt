Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars. 

First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 7
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 8

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, -)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
