Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected and keep track of their connections.
- Node 0: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
- The number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at each node as a central node and checking if it satisfies the definition of a 3-star.
- We will exclude nodes that have less than 3 connections since they cannot form a 3-star.

Now, let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
