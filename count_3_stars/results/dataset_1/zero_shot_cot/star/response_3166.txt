Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph based on the definition of a 3-star. The central nodes will be those with a degree of 3, as they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, the nodes with a degree of 3 are nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
   - Total: 2

2. For node 4:
   - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
   - Total: 1

3. For node 7:
   - <7, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <7, (4, 6, 8)>
   - Total: 2

4. For node 8:
   - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
   - Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
