Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
3. <0, (3, 6, 8)>
4. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
5. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
6. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
7. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
8. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
9. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
10. <6, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
