Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.

2. For each node identified in step 1, find all unique 3-stars where that node is the center:
   - For node 1: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
   - For node 2: <2, (3, 6, 7)>
   - For node 3: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
   - For node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>
   - For node 9: <9, (2, 3, 5)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
