Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
Let's list all the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Counting them all, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
