Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
