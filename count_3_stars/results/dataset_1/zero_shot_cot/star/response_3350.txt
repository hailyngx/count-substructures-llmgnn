Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the central node and its connected nodes in each 3-star configuration.

Given the edges provided in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (1, 5, *)> (Only one 3-star with node 3 as the central node)
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
