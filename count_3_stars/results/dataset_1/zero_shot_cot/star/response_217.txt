Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the possible 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 4)>

By listing out all the unique 3-stars, we can see that there are a total of [12] 3-stars present in the given graph.
