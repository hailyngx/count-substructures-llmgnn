Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:

```
      0
      |
      2 ------ 8 ------ 3
     / \     / |     / |
   9    1 - 6  |    7  |
    \  /       |   /   |
      9        |  4    5
                |
                7
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. 3-star with center node 2: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
2. 3-star with center node 6: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
3. 3-star with center node 8: <8, (2, 6, 3)>
4. 3-star with center node 9: <9, (1, 2, 6)>
5. 3-star with center node 7: <7, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
