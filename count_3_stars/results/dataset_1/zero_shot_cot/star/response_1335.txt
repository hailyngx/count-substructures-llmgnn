Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we identify all nodes with their respective connections to create a clear view of the graph structure:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7
- Node 2 is connected to node 7
- Node 4 is connected to node 8
- Node 5 is connected to node 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6

Now, we search for 3-stars by inspecting each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The possible 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 2)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
