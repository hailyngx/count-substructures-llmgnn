Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each possible 3-star. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 8)>
<8, (4, 7)>
<9, (5)>

Next, we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
