Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 6.
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 8.
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9.
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6.
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6.
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4.
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5.
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6.

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
