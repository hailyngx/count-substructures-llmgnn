Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's list all the possible 3-stars:
1. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 5)>
3. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. <2, (3, 5, 7)>
5. <2, (3, 8, 7)>
6. <2, (5, 6, 7)>
7. <2, (5, 7, 8)>
8. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
9. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
10. <4, (0, 6, 8)>
11. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
12. <5, (0, 1, 7)>
13. <5, (0, 2, 3)>
14. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
15. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
16. <5, (1, 3, 7)>
17. <5, (2, 3, 7)>
18. <6, (2, 4, 8)>
19. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
20. <8, (2, 3, 4)>
21. <8, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
