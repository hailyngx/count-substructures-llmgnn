Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the edges provided.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify nodes with 3 edges:
   - Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 4, and 5.
   - Node 5 has edges with nodes 1, 6, and 8.
   - Node 7 has edges with nodes 3, 6, and 9.

2. Check for 3-stars with these nodes as the center:
   - For node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5) form a 3-star <1, (0, 4, 5)>.
   - For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8) form a 3-star <5, (1, 6, 8)>.
   - For node 7: (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9) form a 3-star <7, (3, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
