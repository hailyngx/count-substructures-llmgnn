Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4. <1, (2, 3, 4)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. <7, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>
