Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7: <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
