Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly 3 connections, these will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
    - Node 0 has 3 connections.
    - Node 1 has 4 connections.
    - Node 2 has 3 connections.
    - Node 3 has 5 connections.
    - Node 4 has 4 connections.
    - Node 5 has 4 connections.
    - Node 6 has 3 connections.
    - Node 7 has 4 connections.
    - Node 8 has 2 connections.
    - Node 9 has 6 connections.
    
Step 2: Find all 3-stars centered at nodes with exactly 3 connections.
    - For node 0: No 3-stars can be formed as it requires 3 leaves.
    - For node 2: No 3-stars can be formed as it requires 3 leaves.
    - For node 6: No 3-stars can be formed as it requires 3 leaves.
    
Step 3: Find all 3-stars centered at nodes with more than 3 connections.
    - For node 1: No 3-stars can be formed as it requires exactly 3 leaves.
    - For node 3: We can form the following 3-star <3, (0, 1, 2)>.
    - For node 4: We can form the following 3-star <4, (1, 2, 5)>.
    - For node 5: We can form the following 3-star <5, (1, 4, 7)>.
    - For node 7: No 3-stars can be formed as it requires exactly 3 leaves.
    - For node 9: We can form the following 3-stars <9, (4, 5, 6)> and <9, (5, 7, 9)>.
    
Step 4: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
    - Total unique 3-stars: [<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>]
    
Output: [<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>] []
