Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these can potentially form 3-stars. 

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:  
- Node 1 (connected to 4, 5, 6, 7)  
- Node 2 (connected to 4, 5, 6)  
- Node 4 (connected to 1, 2, 6, 9)  
- Node 5 (connected to 1, 2)  
- Node 6 (connected to 1, 2, 4, 9)  
- Node 9 (connected to 4, 6, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-stars with center node 1:  
    <1, (4, 5, 6)>  

- 3-stars with center node 2:
    <2, (4, 5, 6)>

- 3-stars with center node 4:
    <4, (1, 2, 6)>
    <4, (1, 6, 9)>
    
- 3-stars with center node 6:
    <6, (1, 2, 4)>
    <6, (1, 4, 9)>

[There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
