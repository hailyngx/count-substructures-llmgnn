Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will be the potential central nodes of 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 5 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: For each potential central node, check if it forms a 3-star.
- Potential central node 0 has neighbors 4, 8, and 9 -> <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- Potential central node 2 is not a central node of any 3-star because it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Potential central node 3 is not a central node of any 3-star because it has more than 3 neighbors.
- Potential central node 5 is not a central node of any 3-star because it has more than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (4, 8, 9)>.

Count of 3-stars: [1]
