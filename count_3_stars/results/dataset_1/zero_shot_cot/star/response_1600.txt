Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: (2, 5, 8)
2. Node 2: (0, 1, 3)
3. Node 4: (6, 9, -)
4. Node 9: (2, 4, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (6, 9, -)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
