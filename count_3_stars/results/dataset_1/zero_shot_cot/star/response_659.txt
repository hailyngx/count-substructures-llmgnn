Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:  

Node 0: 2, 4, 5  
Node 1: 8, 9  
Node 2: 0, 3  
Node 3: 2  
Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 9  
Node 5: 0, 4, 7  
Node 6: 8  
Node 7: 4, 5  
Node 8: 1, 6  
Node 9: 1, 4  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:  

- For node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>  
- For node 1: NO 3-star as it has only 2 connections  
- For node 2: NO 3-star as it has only 2 connections  
- For node 3: NO 3-star as it has only 1 connection  
- For node 4: <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>  
- For node 5: NO 3-star as it has 3 connections but it forms a 4-cycle  
- For node 6: NO 3-star as it has only 1 connection  
- For node 7: NO 3-star as it has 2 connections  
- For node 8: NO 3-star as it has 2 connections  
- For node 9: NO 3-star as it has 2 connections  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 4, 5)>  
<4, (0, 5, 7)>  
<4, (0, 5, 9)>  
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
