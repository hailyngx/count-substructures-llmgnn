Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9, forming a 3-star with center 0 and leaves 3, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9, forming a 3-star with center 1 and leaves 2, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6, forming 3-stars with centers 2 and leaves 1, 3, 5 and 2, respectively.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, forming 3-stars with centers 3 and leaves 0, 2, 4 and 3, 5, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3, forming a 3-star with center 4 and leaves 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, forming a 3-star with center 5 and leaves 2, 3, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, forming a 3-star with center 6 and leaves 2, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 6, forming a 3-star with center 7 and leaves 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, forming 3-stars with centers 8 and leaves 3, 4, 5 and 6, 7.

Therefore, we have the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 9)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<2, (1, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<3, (5, 8)>, 
<4, (3)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<7, (6)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<8, (6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
