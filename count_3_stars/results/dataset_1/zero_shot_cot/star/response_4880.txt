Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 1 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
   - Node 4 has edges to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
   - Node 6 has edges to nodes 5, 7, and 8, but we already have <1, (0, 2, 4)> and <4, (1, 2, 9)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
