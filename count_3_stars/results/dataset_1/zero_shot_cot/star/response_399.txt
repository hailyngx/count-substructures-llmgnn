Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[<1, (0, 9, 3)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (8, 0, 9)>]

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
