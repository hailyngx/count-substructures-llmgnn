Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to three other nodes, which could potentially form a 3-star:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8.

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
For each potential central node, let's check if the other three nodes connected to it are also connected to each other.
1. For node 1: Nodes 3, 4, and 9 are connected to each other.
   - So, <1, (3, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

2. For node 4: Nodes 1, 3, and 9 are not connected to each other.
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 4 as the central node.

3. For node 7: Nodes 0, 5, and 8 are connected to each other.
   - So, <7, (0, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.

Now, we have found two unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 9)> and <7, (0, 5, 8)>.

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [2]
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
