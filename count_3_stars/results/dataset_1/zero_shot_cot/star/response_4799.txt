Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find and list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, _)>  (There is only one 3-star with node 1 as the center, but the third leaf node is not specified)
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (6, 8, _)>

To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we sum up the number of unique 3-stars found above:
