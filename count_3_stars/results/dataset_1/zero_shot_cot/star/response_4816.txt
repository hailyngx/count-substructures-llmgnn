Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. A central node must have exactly 3 neighbors.

From the given edges:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8).
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6).
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 8, 9).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 5).

So, the potential central nodes are 4, 1, 9, and 6.

Next, let's find the 3-stars using these potential central nodes:

1. For central node 4:
   - <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
   
2. For central node 1:
   - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
   
3. For central node 9:
   - <9, (3, 5, 6)>
   
4. For central node 6:
   - <6, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 5)>

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
