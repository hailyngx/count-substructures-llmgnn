Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

Possible 3-star configurations:
1. (0, 3, 4, 7)
2. (3, 2, 4, 7)
3. (4, 1, 3, 7)
4. (7, 0, 3, 4)
5. (8, 3, 5, 7)

After examining the graph, we found that there are [5] unique 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
