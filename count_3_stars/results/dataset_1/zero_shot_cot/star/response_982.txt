Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 9, X)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 8, X)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 7)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 7)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 9)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 9, X)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
