Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9. Therefore, <1, (3, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9. Therefore, <3, (1, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, <8, (1, 2, 3)> and <8, (1, 3, 5)> are two 3-stars.

Counting the unique 3-stars found:
