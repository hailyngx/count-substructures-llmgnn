Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (7, 9, 0)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars found. Since we found two unique 3-stars, the final answer is [2].
