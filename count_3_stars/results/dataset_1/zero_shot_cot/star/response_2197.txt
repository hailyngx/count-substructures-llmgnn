Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<2, (7, 1, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (8, 3, 9)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
