Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 6, 9
Node 1: 5, 7, 8
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 5, 9
Node 5: 1, 4, 6
Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 6
Node 8: 1, 3, 6
Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 9, 5)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
