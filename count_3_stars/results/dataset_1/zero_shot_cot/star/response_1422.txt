Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with degree 3.  
Nodes with degree 3 are nodes 6 and 5.  

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, find the adjacent nodes.  
For node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9)  
For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7)  

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.  
There are 2 3-stars in the given graph.
