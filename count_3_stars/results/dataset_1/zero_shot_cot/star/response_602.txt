Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars:

Node 0: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 1)
Node 1: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 2)
Node 2: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 4)
Node 3: 3-star found: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
Node 4: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 3)
Node 5: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 2)
Node 6: 3-star found: <6, (2, 3, 4)>
Node 7: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 2)
Node 8: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 4)
Node 9: Not part of any 3-star (degree = 4)

Therefore, the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (0, 2, 4)> and <6, (2, 3, 4)>.
