Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 0)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2), (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 0)>
<9, (0, 7, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
