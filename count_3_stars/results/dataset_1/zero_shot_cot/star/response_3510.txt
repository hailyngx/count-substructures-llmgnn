Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each potential 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
