Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors.  
The nodes with three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.  

Step 2: For each of the identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star.  
For node 0, neighbors: 3, 8  
For node 1, neighbors: 5, 9  
For node 2, neighbors: 3, 5, 6  
For node 4, neighbors: 3  
For node 6, neighbors: 2, 8, 9  
For node 8, neighbors: 0, 6  

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.  
From the above analysis, we can see that there are 2 unique 3-stars in the graph.   
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  

<0, (3, 8)>  
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
