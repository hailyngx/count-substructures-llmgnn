Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, the central nodes are nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8.

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph by considering each central node along with its connected nodes.

For central node 0:
- 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 6)>

For central node 1:
- 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 9)>

For central node 5:
- 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 8)>

For central node 8:
- 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- 3-star: <8, (9, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
