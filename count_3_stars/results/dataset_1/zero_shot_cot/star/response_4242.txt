Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them out, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars centered at each node. 

For each node, we will look at the neighboring nodes and form possible 3-stars around it. Then we will count the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- <1, (3, 9)>

Proceeding to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- <2, (3, 9)>

Next, we examine node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9.
- <3, (1, 2, 5)> and <3, (1, 5, 9)> and <3, (2, 5, 9)>

Moving to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>

Lastly, we analyze node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 9)>, <2, (3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>
