Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

After examining the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 5, 1)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 6, 1)>
<8, (3, 7, 1)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10. So, the answer is [10].
