Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the provided edges, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 3, 6
   <0, (3, 6)>

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 3, 9
   <1, (3, 9)>

3. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 0, 1, 4
   <3, (0, 1, 4)>

4. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 2, 4, 6
   <5, (2, 4, 6)>
   
5. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 4, 6, 8
   <5, (4, 6, 8)>

6. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 4, 8, 9
   <5, (4, 8, 9)>

7. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 6, 8, 9
   <5, (6, 8, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
