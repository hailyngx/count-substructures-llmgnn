Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- From node 0: <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- From node 8: <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (7, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>.
