Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges incident to them.

Let's identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 0 has 6 incident edges.
- Node 1 has 4 incident edges.
- Node 2 has 5 incident edges.
- Node 3 has 4 incident edges.
- Node 4 has 3 incident edges.
- Node 5 has 5 incident edges.
- Node 6 has 2 incident edges.
- Node 7 has 2 incident edges.
- Node 8 has 4 incident edges.
- Node 9 has 4 incident edges.

Nodes 4, 6, and 7 qualify as potential central nodes for 3-stars, as they have exactly 3 incident edges each. Let's examine the possible 3-stars centered at these nodes:

1. Central node: 4
   Possible 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 5)>

2. Central node: 6
   No 3-stars can be formed as node 6 has only 2 incident edges.

3. Central node: 7
   No 3-stars can be formed as node 7 has only 2 incident edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is:
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
