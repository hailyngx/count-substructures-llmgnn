Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:

- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 8)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
