Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.  
Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9 have exactly three edges connected to them.  

Step 2: For each of these nodes, identify the edges connected to them.  
- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)  
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9)  
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 9)  
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8)  
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)  
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8)  

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.  
By observing the edges connected to each node, we can identify the 3-stars:  
<0, (3, 6, 7)>  
<0, (3, 8, 9)>  
<2, (3, 5, 6)>  
<4, (3, 8, 9)>  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>  
<5, (3, 6, 8)>  
<6, (0, 1, 2)>  
<6, (0, 2, 3)>  
<6, (0, 3, 5)>  
<6, (1, 2, 3)>  
<6, (2, 3, 5)>  
<9, (0, 1, 2)>  
<9, (0, 2, 4)>  
<9, (0, 4, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>.
