Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's list out all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 4, -)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, -)>
<6, (3, 9, -)>
<7, (4, 8, -)>
<8, (3, 7, -)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
