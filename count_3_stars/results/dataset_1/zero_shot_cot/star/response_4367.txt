Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, the nodes with 3 neighbors are potential centers of 3-stars. The nodes with 3 neighbors in this graph are 0, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [4].
