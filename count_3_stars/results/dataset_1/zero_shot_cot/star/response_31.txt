Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will identify the 3-stars and count them.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
