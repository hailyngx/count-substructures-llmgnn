Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with three neighbors.
    Nodes with three neighbors are: 2, 3, 7, and 9.
    
Step 2: For each node identified in Step 1, check if it forms a 3-star.
    For node 2, the neighbors (1,3,4) do not form a 3-star.
    For node 3, the neighbors (1,2,4) forms a 3-star <3, (1, 2, 4)>.
    For node 7, the neighbors (2,3,5) do not form a 3-star.
    For node 9, the neighbors (2,3,5) do not form a 3-star.
    
Final Answer: [1]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
