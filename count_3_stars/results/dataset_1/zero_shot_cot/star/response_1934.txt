Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify potential 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Since the center node of the 3-star must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we can start by listing all nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:

- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5)
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9)

Now, we can construct the unique 3-stars using this information:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
