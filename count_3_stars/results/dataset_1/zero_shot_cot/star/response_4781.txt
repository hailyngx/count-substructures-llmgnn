Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (2, 3, 6)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
6. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
7. <7, (3, 9)>
8. <8, (5)>
9. <9, (7)>

So, there are a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
