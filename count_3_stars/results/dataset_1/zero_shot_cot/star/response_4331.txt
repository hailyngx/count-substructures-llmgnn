Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8) -> <0, (4, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1: (1, 4) -> <1, (4, 0, 2)>
3. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 6) -> <2, (4, 0, 6)>
4. Node 3: (3, 7), (3, 8) -> <3, (7, 4, 8)>
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8) -> <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. Node 5: (5, 4) -> <5, (4, 0, 1)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 9) -> <6, (0, 2, 9)>
8. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 9) -> <7, (3, 4, 9)>
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 9) -> <8, (0, 3, 4)>
10. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) -> <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 0, 2)>, <2, (4, 0, 6)>, <3, (7, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (4, 0, 1)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
