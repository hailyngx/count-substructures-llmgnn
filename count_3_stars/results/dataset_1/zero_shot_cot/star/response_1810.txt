Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
