Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Let's first identify the central nodes and their connected leaves:

- Central Node 0: Leaves 4, 7
- Central Node 1: Leaves 7, 8, 9
- Central Node 2: Leaves 3, 4, 7
- Central Node 3: Leaves 2, 5, 6, 9
- Central Node 4: Leaves 0, 2, 5, 9
- Central Node 5: Leaves 3, 4
- Central Node 6: Leaves 3, 8, 9
- Central Node 7: Leaves 0, 1, 2
- Central Node 8: Leaves 1, 6
- Central Node 9: Leaves 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6), (4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
