Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The center nodes with 3 leaves connected to each are:
- Node 0: (1, 6, 7)
- Node 1: (0, 9, 9)
- Node 2: (6, 9, 9)
- Node 3: (4, 5, 9)
- Node 4: (3, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (3, 6, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 2, 5)
- Node 7: (0, 4, 9)
- Node 8: (4)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 4)

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 9, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (4)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
