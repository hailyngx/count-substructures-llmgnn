Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars:

<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 2, 7)>
<1, (4, 2, 9)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>

Now we can count the number of unique 3-stars.
