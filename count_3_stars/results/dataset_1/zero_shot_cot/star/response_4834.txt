Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the possible 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <4, (2, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (4, 7, 9)>
6. <6, (4, 9)>
7. <7, (5)>
8. <8, (3)>
9. <9, (5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars based on the identified combinations:
