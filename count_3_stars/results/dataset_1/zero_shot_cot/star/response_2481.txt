Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:

Node 0: 2  
Node 1: 2, 4  
Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 9  
Node 3: 5, 7  
Node 4: 1, 2, 8, 9  
Node 5: 3, 9  
Node 6: 7, 8  
Node 7: 3, 6  
Node 8: 4, 6  
Node 9: 2, 4, 5  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and an edge is missing for the center (6) to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and an edge is missing for the center (8) to form a 3-star.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
