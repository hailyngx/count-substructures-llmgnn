Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8 are connected to three other nodes, making them potential central nodes for 3-star graphs.

Next, we examine the neighbors of these potential central nodes to see which combinations form 3-stars. 

For node 0: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9)  => <0, (3, 8, 9)>
For node 1: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) => <1, (3, 5, 6)>
For node 5: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) => <5, (1, 4, 7)> and <5, (4, 7, 8)>
For node 8: (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) => <8, (0, 5, 6)>

So, the 3-star graphs in the given graph are: 
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
