Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

First, let's list out the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 0, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [5]
