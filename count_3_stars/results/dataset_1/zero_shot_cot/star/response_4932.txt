Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star structures in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

Let's list the nodes to see a clear picture of the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we will go through each node to see if it is the center of any 3-star. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are <0, (1, 8, 7)> and <1, (0, 8, 7)> based on nodes 0 and 1 as the centers.
There are <3, (4, 5, 9)> and <7, (4, 5, 8)> based on nodes 3 and 7 as the centers.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
