Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the provided edges. 
Given that a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 4)>
<2, (1, 8, -)>
<3, (7, 9, -)>
<4, (7, 8, -)>
<5, (7, -, -)>
<6, (0, 7, -)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find a total of [9].
