Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (3, 4, 5)
- Node 1: (3, 5, 7)
- Node 2: (3, 4, 5)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 2)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 5)
- Node 5: (0, 1, 2)
- Node 7: (1, 2, 3)
- Node 8: (0, 3, 5)
- Node 9: (2, 7, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph, which is the number of unique 3-stars identified above. 

[9]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
