Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. To count the number of 3-star structures, we need to find all sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but they are not directly connected to each other.

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
