Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

The nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- To count the number of 3-stars with the central node as node 0:
There are 3 possible 3-stars: <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (7, 5, 9)>.

- To count the number of 3-stars with the central node as node 3:
There is 1 possible 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 6)>.

- To count the number of 3-stars with the central node as node 7:
There is 1 possible 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 6)>.

- To count the number of 3-stars with the central node as node 9:
There is 1 possible 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
