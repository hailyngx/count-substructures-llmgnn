Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star can be formed with node 0 since it only has 1 edge connected to node 8.

2. Node 1: <1, (4, 2, 8)>

3. Node 2: <2, (4, 1, 8)>

4. Node 3: No 3-star can be formed with node 3 since it only has 1 edge connected to node 5.

5. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>

6. Node 5: <5, (3, 6, 9)>

7. Node 6: No 3-star can be formed with node 6 since it only has 1 edge connected to node 7.

8. Node 7: No 3-star can be formed with node 7 since it only has 1 edge connected to node 8.

9. Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 2)>

10. Node 9: No 3-star can be formed with node 9 since it only has 1 edge connected to node 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <2, (4, 1, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, and <8, (0, 1, 2)>.
