Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graph structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (2, 4, 9)>
6. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
7. <8, (0, 1, 6)>
8. <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
