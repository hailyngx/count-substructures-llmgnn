Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the shape of a star.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3] and they are:
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
