Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
