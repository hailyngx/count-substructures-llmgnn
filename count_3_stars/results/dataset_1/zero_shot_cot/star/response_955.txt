Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node in the graph is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify all the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0:
    <0, (2, 5, 7)>

2. Node 2:
    <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    
3. Node 4:
    <4, (2, 5, 6)>
    
4. Node 5:
    <5, (0, 4, 6)>
    
5. Node 6:
    <6, (3, 4, 8)>
    
6. Node 9:
    <9, (1, 2, 4)> and <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
