Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 2 and 4.
   - <0, (2, 4, _)> (center node: 0, leaves: 2, 4)

2. Node 1 has connections with node 6 only.
   - No 3-star centered at node 1.

3. Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
   - <2, (0, 5, 6)> (center node: 2, leaves: 0, 5, 6)
   - <2, (3, 5, 9)> (center node: 2, leaves: 3, 5, 9)

4. Node 3 has connections with nodes 2 and 8.
   - <3, (2, 5, 8)> (center node: 3, leaves: 2, 5, 8)

5. Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - <4, (0, 5, 6)> (center node: 4, leaves: 0, 5, 6)

6. Node 5 has connections with nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
   - <5, (2, 4, 8)> (center node: 5, leaves: 2, 4, 8)
   - <5, (2, 8, 9)> (center node: 5, leaves: 2, 8, 9)

7. Node 6 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   - <6, (1, 2, 4)> (center node: 6, leaves: 1, 2, 4)

8. Node 7 has connections with nodes 2 and 9.
   - <7, (2, 9, _)> (center node: 7, leaves: 2, 9)

9. Node 8 has connections with nodes 3 and 5.
   - <8, (3, 5, _)> (center node: 8, leaves: 3, 5)

10. Node 9 has connections with nodes 2, 5, and 7.
   - <9, (2, 5, 7)> (center node: 9, leaves: 2, 5, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, _)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
