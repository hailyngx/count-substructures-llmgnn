Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (0, 9, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 5)>
<5, (4, 4, 0)>
<6, (8, 9, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
