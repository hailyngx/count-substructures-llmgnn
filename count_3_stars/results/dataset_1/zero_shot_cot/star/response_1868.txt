Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph with center nodes and corresponding leaf nodes.

1. **Node 0**: (0, 2), (0, 5) → <0, (2, 5)>
2. **Node 1**: (1, 3), (1, 8) → <1, (3, 8)>
3. **Node 2**: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 9) → <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>
4. **Node 3**: (3, 1), (3, 4) → <3, (1, 4)>
5. **Node 4**: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 7) → <4, (2, 3, 7)>
6. **Node 5**: (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 8) → <5, (0, 6, 8)>
7. **Node 6**: (6, 5) → <6, (5)>
8. **Node 7**: (7, 2), (7, 4) → <7, (2, 4)>
9. **Node 8**: (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 9) → <8, (1, 5, 9)>
10. **Node 9**: (9, 2), (9, 8) → <9, (2, 8)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
