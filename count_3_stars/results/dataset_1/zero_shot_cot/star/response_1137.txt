Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Counting 3-stars: 
- Node 0: (0, 2, 4)
- Node 1: (1, 3, 4)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 1, 4)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 2)
- Node 5: None
- Node 8: None
- Node 9: None

Total number of 3-stars: 5
