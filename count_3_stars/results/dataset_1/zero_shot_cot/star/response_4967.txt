Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 4, 8
- Node 3: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 1: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 2: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 3: Two 3-stars: <3, (4, 7, 9)> and <3, (5, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 6: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (not connected to 3 nodes)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <3, (4, 7, 9)> and <3, (5, 4, 7)>.
