Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-star configurations. 
Let's list them step-by-step:

1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes (2, 6, 7).
2. Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes (0, 8, 7).
3. Node 5 cannot form a 3-star because it only has one connection.
4. Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes (0, 7, 7) and (7, 0, 7).
5. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes (0, 6, 7), (0, 7, 8), and (2, 8, 7).
6. Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes (2, 7, 8).
7. Node 9 cannot form a 3-star because it only has one connection.

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 7)>, <6, (7, 0, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
