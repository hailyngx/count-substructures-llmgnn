Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
- Node 8 is connected to node 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 9)> -> Node 0 as the center, connected to nodes 6 and 9
- <1, (5, 6)> -> Node 1 as the center, connected to nodes 5 and 6
- <2, (7, 9)> -> Node 2 as the center, connected to nodes 7 and 9
- <4, (5, 7, 8)> -> Node 4 as the center, connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8
- <6, (0, 1, 9)> -> Node 6 as the center, connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
