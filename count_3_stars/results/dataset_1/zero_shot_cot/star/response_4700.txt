Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. 

Let's analyze the graph step by step:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star since it is only connected to node 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8.
  - <1, (0, 5, 8)> is a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 5, and 8 as leaves.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
  -  <2, (3, 7, 8)> is a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 3, 7, and 8 as leaves.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.

From the analysis, we can see that there are two unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
