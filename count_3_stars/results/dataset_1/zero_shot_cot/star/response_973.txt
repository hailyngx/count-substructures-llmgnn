Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step.

Step 1:
Identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}

Step 2:
Identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that can form a 3-star configuration:
- Node 0: No 3-star
- Node 1: No 3-star
- Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 3)>
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: No 3-star

Step 3:
Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
- Total number of 3-stars = 2

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<2, (1, 6, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>}.
