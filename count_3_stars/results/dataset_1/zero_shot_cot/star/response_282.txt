Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>

<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>

<4, (2, 7, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<4, (7, 5, 7)>

<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>

<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 2)>

<7, (4, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 5, 5)>
<7, (5, 2, 2)>

<8, (0, 9, 9)>
<8, (0, 9, 2)>
<8, (0, 9, 8)>
<8, (9, 2, 8)>

<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 8)>
<9, (2, 8, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [26]
