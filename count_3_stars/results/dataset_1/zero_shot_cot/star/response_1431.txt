Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes in a 3-star graph are the nodes with exactly three edges incident upon them, forming the "star" shape.

From the given edges, the central nodes are nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.

Next, let's list out the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have 12 in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
