Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 as a central node to form 3-stars.

Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9

Now, let's check for each of these nodes the connections they have with other nodes to form a 3-star. 

- For node 1:
    - (1, 0, 4), (1, 4, 5)

- For node 4:
    - (4, 0, 1), (4, 1, 7)

- For node 6:
    - (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 5), (6, 2, 7), (6, 5, 9), (6, 7, 9)

- For node 9:
    - (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 6), (9, 5, 7), (9, 6, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 0, 4)>, <0, (6, 0, 2)>, <0, (6, 0, 5)>, <0, (9, 0, 5)>, <0, (9, 0, 6)> and the unique count is [6].
