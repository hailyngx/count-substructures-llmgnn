Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes in the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 9, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, -)>
<5, (7, -, -)>
<6, (2, 9, -)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, -, -)>
<9, (0, 6, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
