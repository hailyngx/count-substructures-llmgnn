Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (8, 3, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
