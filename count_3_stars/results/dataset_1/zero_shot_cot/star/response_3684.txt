Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 9, 4)>
2. 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (2, 6, 8)>
3. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
4. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (4, 8, 9)>
6. 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
7. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
