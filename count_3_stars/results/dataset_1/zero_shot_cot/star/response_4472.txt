Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 0, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
