Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's search for all 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
