Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 6)  [<0, (3, 4, 6)>]
- Node 1: (1, 6, 7), (1, 6, 9)  [<1, (6, 7, 9)>]
- Node 2: (2, 3, 9)  [<2, (3, 9, 2)>]
- Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 4)  [<3, (0, 2, 4)>]
- Node 4: (4, 0, 3), (4, 3, 6), (4, 6, 8)  [<4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>]
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 7), (6, 0, 9), (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 9), (6, 4, 8), (6, 5, 6), (6, 6, 7), (6, 6, 8), (6, 6, 9), (6, 7, 9)  [<6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>]
- Node 9: (9, 1, 2), (9, 1, 6)  [<9, (1, 2, 9)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
