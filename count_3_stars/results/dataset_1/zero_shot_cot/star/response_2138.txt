Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's analyze the given graph step by step to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7. It forms one 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 6)>.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, 8. It forms one 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 7)>.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8. Since it has only two connections, it cannot form a 3-star.
4. Node 9 is connected to node 8. It also does not form a 3-star.
 
The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are: <1, (2, 4, 6)> and <3, (0, 1, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
