Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9. However, nodes 1, 2, and 9 have more than one connection to other nodes, so they cannot be centers of 3-stars.

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. Again, nodes 4 and 9 have more than one connection to other nodes, so node 3 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

3. Node 7 is connected to node 1, which is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9. However, nodes 0 and 5 have more than one connection, so node 1 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

4. Node 8 is connected to node 4, which is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 9. Node 4 has only one connection to nodes 8 and 0, so node 4 can be the center of a 3-star. The 3-star would include nodes 0, 8, and either 3, 5, 6, or 9.

Therefore, there is only 1 unique 3-star in this graph: <4, (0, 3, 5, 6, 9)>.
