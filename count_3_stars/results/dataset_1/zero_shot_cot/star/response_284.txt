Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

Starting with node 0: 
- Node 0 is connected to node 5.
- There is no 3-star centered at node 0.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- There is no 3-star centered at node 1.

Checking node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to node 9.
- There is no 3-star centered at node 2.

Analyzing node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- There is one 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- There is no 3-star centered at node 4.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- There is no 3-star centered at node 5.

Moving to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- There is no 3-star centered at node 6.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- There is no 3-star centered at node 7.

Analyzing node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 9.
- There is one 3-star: <8, (1, 7, 9)>.

Checking node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- There is one 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph. These 3-stars are <3, (4, 5, 6)> and <8, (1, 7, 9)>.
