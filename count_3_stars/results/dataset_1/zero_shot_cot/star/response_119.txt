Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list down all the nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<Node, (Leaves)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, we find a total of 10 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as [10].
