Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

Given the edges in the graph, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming 3-stars around each of them.

Identifying the 3-stars:

<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
