Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, which will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 7, _)>
