Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the highest degree. From the edge list, we can see that nodes 1 and 4 have the highest degree of 6.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3 connected to one common node. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
