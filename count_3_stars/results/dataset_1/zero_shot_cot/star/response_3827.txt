Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- There are 4 possible 3-stars with the center at node 2: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, and <2, (3, 4, 6)>.
- There are 4 possible 3-stars with the center at node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, and <3, (5, 8, 0)>.
- There is 1 3-star with the center at node 4: <4, (2, 6, 8)>.
- There is 1 3-star with the center at node 6: <6, (2, 4, 9)>.
- There is 1 3-star with the center at node 8: <8, (3, 4, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
