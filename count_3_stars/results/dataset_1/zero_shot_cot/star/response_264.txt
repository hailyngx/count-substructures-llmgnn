Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three incident edges since a 3-star graph has a center connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

From the provided edges, the nodes with exactly three incident edges are nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have four 3-stars in total, so the answer is [4].
