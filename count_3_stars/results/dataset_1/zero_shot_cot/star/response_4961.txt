Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

[6]

<0, (3, 9, 7)>
<1, (2, 9, 3)>
<2, (1, 1, 1)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 7, 7)>
<7, (3, 9, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
