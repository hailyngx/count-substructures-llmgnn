Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3.
   
   - Node 7 has degree 3. Node 9 also has degree 3, but we will only consider one central node for each unique 3-star.

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, determine the 3-stars.

   - For node 7: <7, (0, 3, 9)>
   - For node 9: <9, (2, 7, -)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

   - There are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
