Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 0)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 0)>
<3, (0, 6, 0)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found in the given graph, we get a total of [11].
