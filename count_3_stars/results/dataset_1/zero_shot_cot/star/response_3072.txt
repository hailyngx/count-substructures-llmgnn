Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:  
   - Nodes connected to node 0 are: 3, 4, 5
   - 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>

2. For node 2:  
   - Nodes connected to node 2 are: 3, 5, 7, 8
   - 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 7)>

3. For node 3:  
   - Nodes connected to node 3 are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
   - 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 4)>

4. For node 4:  
   - Nodes connected to node 4 are: 0, 3, 6
   - 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 6)>

5. For node 5:  
   - Nodes connected to node 5 are: 0, 2
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 5 as the central node.

6. For node 6:  
   - Nodes connected to node 6 are: 3, 4, 7
   - 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>

7. For node 7:  
   - Nodes connected to node 7 are: 2, 6, 8, 9
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 7 as the central node.

8. For node 8:  
   - Nodes connected to node 8 are: 2, 3, 7
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 8 as the central node.

9. For node 9:  
   - Nodes connected to node 9 are: 3, 7
   - No 3-star can be formed with node 9 as the central node.

From the information given, we have identified six unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
