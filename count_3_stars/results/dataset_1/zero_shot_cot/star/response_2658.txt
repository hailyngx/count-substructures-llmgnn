Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Start by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would be the centers of the 3-stars.
   - In this case, nodes 0, 3, and 8 are the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each of these center nodes, identify the three nodes that are connected to them to form a 3-star. Ensure that these three nodes don't have any direct edge between them.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

For node 0:
   - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
   
For node 3:
   - <3, (5, 7, 8)>
   
For node 8:
   - <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
