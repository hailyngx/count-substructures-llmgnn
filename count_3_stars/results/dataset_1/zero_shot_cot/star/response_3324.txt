Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<8, (1, 7, 9)>
