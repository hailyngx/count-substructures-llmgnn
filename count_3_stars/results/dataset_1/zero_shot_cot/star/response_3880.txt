Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided. 

Let's list all the possible 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, _)>
<4, (3, 5, _)>
<5, (1, 4, _)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, _)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of 10 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
