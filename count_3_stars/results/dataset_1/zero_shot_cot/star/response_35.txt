Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, -)>
<6, (1, -, -)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 7, -)>
<9, (2, -, -)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: 
[9]
