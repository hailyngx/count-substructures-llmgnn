Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observations:
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8 have degree 4.
- Nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9 have degree 2.
- Node 1 has degree 1.

Since nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8 have degree 4, they are potential center nodes for 3-stars. Let's analyze each of these nodes to find their adjacent nodes:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9)
   No 3-star with center at node 0 since it has more than 3 neighbors.

2. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9)
   <2, (0, 3, 8)> (3-star centered at node 2)

3. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2)
   No 3-star with center at node 3 since it has less than 3 neighbors.

4. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8)
   <7, (0, 1, 4)> (3-star centered at node 7)

5. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)
   <8, (2, 4, 7)> (3-star centered at node 8)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
