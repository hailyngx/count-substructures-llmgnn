Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star subgraph.

Let's find all the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. For central node 0:
    - (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) form a 3-star with node 0 at the center. <0, (3, 4, 8)>

2. For central node 1:
    - (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) form a 3-star with node 1 at the center. <1, (3, 6, 8)>

3. For central node 2:
    - No 3-star can be formed as there are not enough edges connected to node 2.

4. For central node 3:
    - No 3-star can be formed as there are not enough edges connected to node 3.

5. For central node 4:
    - (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) form a 3-star with node 4 at the center. <4, (0, 3, 9)>

6. For central node 6:
    - No 3-star can be formed as there are not enough edges connected to node 6.

7. For central node 7:
    - No 3-star can be formed as there are not enough edges connected to node 7.

8. For central node 8:
    - No 3-star can be formed as there are not enough edges connected to node 8.

9. For central node 9:
    - No 3-star can be formed as there are not enough edges connected to node 9.

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [3].

<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>
