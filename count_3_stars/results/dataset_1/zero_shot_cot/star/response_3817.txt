Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 8, 4)>
<2, (1, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
