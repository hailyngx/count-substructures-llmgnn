Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 8 also forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 7, and 8.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
