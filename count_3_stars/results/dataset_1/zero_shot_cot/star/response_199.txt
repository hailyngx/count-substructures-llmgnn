Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
1. Node 0: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 9, -)>
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 7, -)>
6. Node 5: <5, (2, -, -)>
7. Node 6: <6, (2, 9, -)>
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 2)>
9. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
