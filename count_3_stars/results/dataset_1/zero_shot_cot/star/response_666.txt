Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
4. <0, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
6. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
7. <0, (5, 6, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
