Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6: <1, (2, 3, 6)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <4, (6, 7, 8)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
