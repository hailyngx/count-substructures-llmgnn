Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node of each 3-star in the given graph. Then, we will find the leaves connected to each central node to form the 3-stars.

The central nodes are:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, for each central node, we will find the leaves connected to it to form the 3-stars:

For central node 0:
- <0, (4, 7)>

For central node 1:
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>

For central node 2:
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>

For central node 3:
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>

For central node 4:
- <4, (0, 9)>

For central node 5:
- <5, (2)>

For central node 6:
- <6, (8)>

For central node 7:
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (1, 6)>

For central node 9:
- <9, (1, 3, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
