Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 
First, let's clarify the definition of a 3-star graph: it consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

There are two steps we need to follow:
1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star pattern.

After analyzing the given graph, we identify the following nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
