Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes (forming a 3-star). Let's find them step by step:

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 4, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the central node and nodes 1, 4, and 8 as the leaves. <0, (1, 4, 8)>

2. Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 7, and 9, but we have already counted the 3-star with central node 0. No new 3-star is formed.

3. Node 2 has edges with nodes 7, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 7, 8, and 9 as the leaves. <2, (7, 8, 9)>

4. Node 3 has edges with nodes 4 and 6. No 3-star is formed.

5. Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9. We have already counted the 3-stars with central nodes 0 and 2. No new 3-star is formed.

6. Node 5 has an edge with node 9. No 3-star is formed.

7. Node 6 has edges with nodes 3 and 7. No 3-star is formed.

8. Node 7 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8. We have already counted the 3-stars with central nodes 0 and 2. No new 3-star is formed.

9. Node 8 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 9. We have already counted the 3-star with central node 2. No new 3-star is formed.

10. Node 9 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5. We have already counted the 3-star with node 2 as the central node. No new 3-star is formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 8)> and <2, (7, 8, 9)>.
