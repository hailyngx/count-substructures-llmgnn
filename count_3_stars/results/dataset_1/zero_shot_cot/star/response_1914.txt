Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we can count the unique 3-stars.

Starting with the given graph, let's list all the 3-stars:

<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4].
