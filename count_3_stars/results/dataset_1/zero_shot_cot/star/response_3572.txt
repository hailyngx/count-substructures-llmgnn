Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting with node 0: 
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
    <0, (2, 9)>

2. Moving on to node 1: 
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
    <1, (6, 7)>

3. Analysis for node 2: 
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
    <2, (0, 9)>

4. Assessing node 3: 
    - Node 3 is connected to node 4.
    No 3-star found since node 3 has only one connected node.

5. Looking at node 4: 
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
    <4, (3, 8)>

6. Evaluating node 5: 
    - Node 5 is connected to node 7.
    No 3-star found since node 5 has only one connected node.

7. Examining node 6: 
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
    <6, (1, 9)>

8. Moving on to node 7: 
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
    <7, (1, 5, 8)>
    <7, (1, 9)>
    <7, (5, 8)>
    <7, (8, 9)>

9. Analyzing node 8: 
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
    <8, (4, 7)>

10. Final assessment for node 9: 
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7.
    <9, (0, 2, 6)>
    <9, (0, 2, 7)>
    <9, (0, 6, 7)>
    <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 9)>, <1, (6, 7)>, <2, (0, 9)>, <4, (3, 8)>, <6, (1, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 9)>, <7, (5, 8)>, <7, (8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>.
