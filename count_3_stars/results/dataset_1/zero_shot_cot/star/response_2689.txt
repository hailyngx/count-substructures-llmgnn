Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes in the graph. The center nodes will have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Looking at the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 2 are the center nodes.

Now, let's identify the leaves connected to each center node to form the 3-stars. We have the following combinations:

- Center node 0: (0, 4, 6), (0, 4, 9), (0, 6, 9)  
- Center node 1: (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 7)
- Center node 2: (2, 5, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of three unique 3-stars in the given graph.
