Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Starting from the given graph, the 3-stars can be identified by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find them step by step:

1. Nodes with three edges:
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 8), (5, 2)
  <2, (5, 8, 7)>

2. Nodes with two edges:
- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 7)
  <0, (4, 7, 3)>

- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 7)
  <3, (6, 7, 0)>

- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 9)
  <5, (2, 9, 7)>

- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 7)
  <6, (1, 3, 7)>

- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9)
  <7, (0, 3, 8)>
  <7, (6, 2, 9)>
  <7, (8, 7, 9)>

- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 7)
  <8, (2, 7, 9)>

- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 7)
  <9, (5, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
