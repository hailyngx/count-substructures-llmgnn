Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars it contains. 
Since the graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges, it is helpful to first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node. 

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
Node 8 is connected to node 0.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by considering the central node and its three leaves connected to it: 

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 7, 2)>

As we have identified all the possible 3-stars in this graph, the total count is 9. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
