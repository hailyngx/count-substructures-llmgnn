Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's start by finding all the unique 3-stars. 

1. Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 3 and 9.

Thus, potential 3-stars involve nodes 0, 7, and 8.

2. Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 9, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
