Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

First, let's list all the nodes connected to each other:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, X)> (no 3-star as X is not connected to node 1)
<2, (1, 6, X)> (no 3-star as X is not connected to node 2)
<3, (8, X, X)> (no 3-star as there is only one node connected to node 3)
<4, (0, X, X)> (no 3-star as there is only one node connected to node 4)
<5, (8, X, X)> (no 3-star as there is only one node connected to node 5)
<6, (2, 8, X)> (no 3-star as X is not connected to node 6)
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (7, 8, X)> (no 3-star as X is not connected to node 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
