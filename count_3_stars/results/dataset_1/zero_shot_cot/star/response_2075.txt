Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.

2. Construct the 3-stars using the identified nodes as centers:
   - <2, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <6, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
