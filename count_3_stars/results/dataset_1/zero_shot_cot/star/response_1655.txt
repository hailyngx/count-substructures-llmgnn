Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 and its neighbors: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 5)
   Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 5)>.

2. Node 1 and its neighbors: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7)
   Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>.

3. Node 2 and its neighbors: (2, 0), (2, 7)
   Node 2 does not form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 and its neighbors: (3, 1), (3, 7)
   Node 3 does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 4 and its neighbors: (4, 1), (4, 9)
   Node 4 does not form a 3-star.

6. Node 5 and its neighbors: (5, 0), (5, 8), (5, 9)
   Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 8, 9)>.

7. Node 6 and its neighbors: (6, 9)
   Node 6 does not form a 3-star.

8. Node 7 and its neighbors: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)
   Node 7 does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 8 and its neighbors: (8, 5)
   Node 8 does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9 and its neighbors: (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)
    Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, and <5, (0, 8, 9)>.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5].
