Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three adjacent edges. These nodes are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's list them: 

Potential central nodes: {0, 1, 2, 8}

Now, let's examine each potential central node to see if it forms a 3-star:

For node 0: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4. Thus, potential 3-stars with node 0 as central node are: 
  <0, (2, 4)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 9. Thus, potential 3-stars with node 1 as central node are: 
  <1, (3, 9)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to node 0. As node 0 is already considered, there are no additional 3-stars with node 2 as the central node. 

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to node 3. Node 3 is already considered, so there are no additional 3-stars with node 8 as the central node.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4)>
<1, (3, 9)>

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
