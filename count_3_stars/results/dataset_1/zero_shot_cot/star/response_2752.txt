Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking for the central nodes and their connected leaf nodes:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with (1, 4, 6) <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (0, 3, 7) <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (1, 2, 7) <3, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
