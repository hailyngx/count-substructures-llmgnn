Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. These central nodes are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following central nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get [5].
