Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

The 3-star structures in this graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<1, (7, 9, 6)>
<2, (3, 0, _)>
<3, (0, 2, _)>
<5, (8, 9, _)>
<6, (7, 9, _)>
<7, (1, 6, _)>
<8, (0, 5, _)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
