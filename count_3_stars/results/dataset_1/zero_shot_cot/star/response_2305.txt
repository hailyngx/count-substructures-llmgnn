Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
6. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
7. <7, (2, 9, 7)>
8. <9, (3, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
