Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above gives us a total of [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
