Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be considered as the central nodes of the 3-stars.
2. Determine the nodes connected to each central node. These connected nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars.
3. Count the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: Node 0
   Leaves: Nodes 1, 2, 4
   <0, (1, 2, 4)>

2. Central node: Node 1
   Leaves: Nodes 0, 2, 9
   <1, (0, 2, 9)>

3. Central node: Node 2
   Leaves: Nodes 0, 1, 4
   <2, (0, 1, 4)>

4. Central node: Node 3
   Leaves: Nodes 4, 5, 9
   <3, (4, 5, 9)>

5. Central node: Node 4
   Leaves: Nodes 0, 2, 3
   <4, (0, 2, 3)>

6. Central node: Node 5
   Leaves: Nodes 3, 6, 8
   <5, (3, 6, 8)>

7. Central node: Node 6
   Leaves: Nodes 3, 5, 7
   <6, (3, 5, 7)>

8. Central node: Node 7
   Leaves: Nodes 6, 8, 9
   <7, (6, 8, 9)>

9. Central node: Node 8
   Leaves: Nodes 0, 5, 7
   <8, (0, 5, 7)>

10. Central node: Node 9
    Leaves: Nodes 1, 2, 3
    <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
