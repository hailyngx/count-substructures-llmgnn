Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of 3-stars present in it.

Given edges:
(0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
To have a 3-star, a node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes of possible 3-stars are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:

For node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5) -> <2, (1, 3, 5)>
For node 3: (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7) -> <3, (2, 5, 7)>
For node 4: No 3-star can be formed as it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
For node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7) -> <5, (3, 4, 7)>
For node 6: (6, 7), (6, 8) -> <6, (7, 8)>
For node 7: (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9) -> <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>
For node 8: (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9) -> <8, (6, 7, 9)>
For node 9: (9, 7), (9, 8) -> <9, (7, 8)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found: <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 8)>

So, there are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
