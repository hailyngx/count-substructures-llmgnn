Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. From the list of edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
   - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <3, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <7, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
