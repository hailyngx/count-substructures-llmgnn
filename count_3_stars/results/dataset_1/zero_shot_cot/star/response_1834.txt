Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-star patterns in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 6)>
<1, (2, 9, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 5)>
<5, (6, 9, 1)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 6, 1)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
