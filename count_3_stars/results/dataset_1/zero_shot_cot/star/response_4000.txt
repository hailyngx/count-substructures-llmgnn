Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify all nodes in the graph.
2. For each node, find all edges connected to it.
3. Look for patterns where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start the analysis:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Three possible scenarios for each node to be the center of a 3-star:
1. Node A is the center, connected to nodes B, C, and D: (A, B), (A, C), (A, D)

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
