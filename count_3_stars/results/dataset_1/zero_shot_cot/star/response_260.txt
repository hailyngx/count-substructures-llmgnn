Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 3 as the leaves.  
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 4, 6, and 9 as the leaves.  
3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 1, 7, and 9 as the leaves.  

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
