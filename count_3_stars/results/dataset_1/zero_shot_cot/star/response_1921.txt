Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three adjacent nodes for each 3-star in the graph.

Let's first identify the 3-stars based on the given edges:
- For each node in the graph, identify the adjacent nodes.
- If a node has exactly three adjacent nodes, form a 3-star with the node as the center and the three adjacent nodes as leaves.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
