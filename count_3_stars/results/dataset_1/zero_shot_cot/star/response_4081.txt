Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star structures. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, -)>
<3, (0, 6, -)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, -)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
