Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Identify the nodes in the graph that have exactly three edges connected to them. 
2. For each of these nodes, check if the three connected nodes form a 3-star. 
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Let's follow these steps:

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 7, 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

3-stars found:
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 1)>

<6, (2, 7, 9)>

<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 1)>
<8, (7, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
