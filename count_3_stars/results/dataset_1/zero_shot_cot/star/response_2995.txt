Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
