Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
