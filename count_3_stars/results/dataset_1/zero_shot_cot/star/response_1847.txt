Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for each node that has exactly three neighbors connected by edges. Let's identify these 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 5)
    <0, (2, 5)>
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6)
    <1, (3, 6)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5)
    <2, (0, 5)>
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)
    <3, (1, 5, 7)>
    <3, (1, 5, 9)>
5. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 8)
    <4, (5, 8)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9)
    <5, (0, 2, 3)>
    <5, (0, 3, 4)>
    <5, (2, 3, 4)>
    <5, (3, 4, 9)>
7. Node 6: (6, 1)
8. Node 7: (7, 3)
9. Node 8: (8, 4)
10. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 5)
    <9, (3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5)>
<1, (3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 5)>
