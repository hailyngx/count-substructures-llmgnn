Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). 

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 9, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 9, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
