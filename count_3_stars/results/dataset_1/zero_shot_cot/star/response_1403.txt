Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A central node in a 3-star graph is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.  

By observing the given edges, we can determine the central nodes in this graph:
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 5 and 8, forming a potential 3-star.
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 6, 7, and 8, forming a potential 3-star.
- Node 8 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9, forming a potential 3-star.
- Node 9 has connections with nodes 3 and 8.

Now, let's investigate each potential 3-star:
- For node 1: (1, 5) and (1, 8) form a 3-star with center node 1: <1, (5, 8)>
- For node 2: (2, 6), (2, 7), and (2, 8) form 3 3-stars with center node 2:
    <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 8)>, and <2, (7, 8)>.
- For node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), and (8, 9) form 1 3-star with center node 8: <8, (1, 2, 9)>.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are: <1, (5, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 8)>, <2, (7, 8)>, and <8, (1, 2, 9)>.
