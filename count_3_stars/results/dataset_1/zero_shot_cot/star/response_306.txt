Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze each node:

- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 2 is part of the following 3-stars: <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4 is part of the 3-star: <4, (6, 9, 1)>.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6 is part of the following 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 9, 7)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 3)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9 is part of the following 3-stars: <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (4, 6, 2)>.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 9, 1)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 9, 7)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 3)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 4)>, <9, (4, 6, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
