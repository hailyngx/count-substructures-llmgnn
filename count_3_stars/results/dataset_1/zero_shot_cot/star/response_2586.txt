Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star. 
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star. 
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6, forming a 3-star. 
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5, forming a 3-star.
5. Node 8 is connected to node 0 and two nodes (no 3-star). 
6. Node 9 is connected to node 4 and one other node (no 3-star).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
