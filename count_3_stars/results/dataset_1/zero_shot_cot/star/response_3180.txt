Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's list all the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by checking each possible combination:
- Node 1: (2, 4, 5)
- Node 2: (1, 3, 5)
- Node 3: (2, 4, 7)
- Node 5: (1, 2, 9)
- Node 7: (3, 5, 8)
- Node 8: (5, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (2, 5, 7)

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

There are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the graph.
