Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

- For node 0: (0, 8), (0, 8), (0, 8)
- For node 1: (1, 5), (1, 5), (1, 9)
- For node 2: (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 8)
- For node 3: (3, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7)
- For node 4: (4, 6), (4, 6), (4, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 1), (5, 6)
- For node 6: (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)
- For node 7: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 2)
- For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 9)
- For node 9: (9, 1), (9, 8)

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the answer is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (8, 8, 8)>
<1, (5, 5, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 8)>
<3, (6, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)> 
<9, (1, 8)>
