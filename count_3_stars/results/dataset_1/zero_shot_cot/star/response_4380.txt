Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars (it's only connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 0 3-stars (it's only connected to 2 nodes)
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars (it's only connected to 3 nodes)
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 9 forms 0 3-stars (it's only connected to 2 nodes)

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>
