Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 14. Therefore, the final answer is [14].
