Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center node of each potential 3-star in the graph. Then we can list out all the 3-stars present. 

1. The center node 0 has three attached nodes: 5, 6, 1. So, the 3-stars with center node 0 are <0, (5, 6, 1)>.

2. The center node 1 has only one attached node: 5. So, there are no 3-stars with center node 1.

3. The center node 2 has two attached nodes: 6, 8. So, there are no 3-stars with center node 2.

4. The center node 3 has two attached nodes: 7, 8. So, there are no 3-stars with center node 3.

5. The center node 4 has three attached nodes: 5, 6, 8. So the 3-stars with center node 4 are <4, (5, 6, 8)>.

6. The center node 5 has four attached nodes: 0, 1, 4, 7. So the 3-stars with center node 5 are <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, and <5, (1, 4, 7)>.

7. The center node 6 has three attached nodes: 0, 2, 4. So the 3-stars with center node 6 are <6, (0, 2, 4)>.

8. The center node 7 has two attached nodes: 3, 5. So, there are no 3-stars with center node 7.

9. The center node 8 has three attached nodes: 2, 3, 4. So the 3-stars with center node 8 are <8, (2, 3, 4)>.

From the above analysis, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, and <8, (2, 3, 4)>.
