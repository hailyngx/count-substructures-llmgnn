Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: {(0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 7), (0, 2, 9)}
- From node 1: {(1, 2, 9)}
- From node 2: {(2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 4), (2, 0, 7), (2, 0, 9), (2, 1, 9), (2, 4, 3), (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 9), (2, 7, 0), (2, 7, 9), (2, 9, 0), (2, 9, 1), (2, 9, 3), (2, 9, 5), (2, 9, 8)}
- From node 3: {(3, 0, 4), (3, 0, 9), (3, 4, 2), (3, 9, 0)}
- From node 4: {(4, 2, 3), (4, 2, 8), (4, 3, 0)}
- From node 5: {(5, 6, 9)}
- From node 6: {(6, 5, 8)}
- From node 7: {(7, 0, 2)}
- From node 8: {(8, 4, 6), (8, 4, 9), (8, 6, 5), (8, 9, 0)}
- From node 9: {(9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 8), (9, 1, 2), (9, 2, 0), (9, 2, 4), (9, 2, 7), (9, 2, 8), (9, 3, 4), (9, 3, 5), (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 9), (9, 8, 4)}

By counting the unique 3-stars above, we find a total of 20 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
