Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Checking each node one by one, we find that the nodes that form 3-stars are:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7.]
