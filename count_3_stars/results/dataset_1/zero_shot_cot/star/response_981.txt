Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph and count the number of 3-stars in it step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0: (4, 5, 8)
- Node 1: (4, 9)
- Node 2: (3, 5, 7)
- Node 3: (2, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 1, 3, 5)
- Node 5: (0, 2, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 6: (8)
- Node 7: (2, 8)
- Node 8: (0, 5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (1, 3, 8)

Step 2: Find the 3-stars in the graph:
From the connections above, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 9)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [6].
