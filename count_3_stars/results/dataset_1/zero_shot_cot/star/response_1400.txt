Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: Nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9 fit this criteria since they have degree 3.

2. Check each of these nodes and their adjacent nodes to see if they form 3-stars:
    
    - For node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 5), (0, 5, 9), (0, 9, 1) -> <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    
    - For node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 6), (2, 0, 6) -> <2, (0, 3, 6)>
    
    - For node 6: (6, 2, 5), (6, 2, 8), (6, 8, 9), (6, 9, 5) -> <6, (2, 5, 8)>
    
    - For node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 4, 6), (9, 6, 1), (9, 1, 0) -> <9, (0, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars found in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>.
