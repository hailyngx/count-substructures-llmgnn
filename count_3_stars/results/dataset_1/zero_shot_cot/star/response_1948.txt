Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Then we can form the 3-stars accordingly.

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. We will now list the 3-stars based on these central nodes:

<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, -)>
<4, (1, 9, -)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
