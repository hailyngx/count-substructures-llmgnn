Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 2: No 3-star
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star
7. Node 6: No 3-star
8. Node 7: No 3-star
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 4)>
10. Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]  
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
