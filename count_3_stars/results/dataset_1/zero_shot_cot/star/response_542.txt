Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like formation. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 4: <8, (7, 3, 4)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
