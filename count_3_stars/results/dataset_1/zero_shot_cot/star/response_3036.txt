Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node for each potential 3-star by checking all nodes and their connections. Afterwards, we will list the unique 3-stars found and then count them.

1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
2. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6.
3. Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7.
4. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9.
5. Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 8.
6. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3.
7. Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5.
8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 5.
9. Node 9: Connected to node 4.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
