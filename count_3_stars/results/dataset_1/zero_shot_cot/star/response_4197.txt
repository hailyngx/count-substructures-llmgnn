Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 8

Now, we can see that there are three 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
1. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
3. <0, (2, 3, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
