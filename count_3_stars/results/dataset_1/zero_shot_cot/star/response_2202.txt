Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three leaf nodes. 

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 5, 1)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <1, (4, 8, 9)>
4. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
6. <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the graph.
