Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and there is no more room for another edge.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4, and there is no more room for another edge.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 9, and there is no more room for another edge.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 4, and there is no more room for another edge.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5, and there is no more room for another edge.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

We have two 3-stars in this graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
