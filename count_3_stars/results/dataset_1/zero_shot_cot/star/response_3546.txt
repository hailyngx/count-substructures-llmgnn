Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
2. <5, (3, 7, 8)>
3. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <9, (2, 8, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars found: [4].
