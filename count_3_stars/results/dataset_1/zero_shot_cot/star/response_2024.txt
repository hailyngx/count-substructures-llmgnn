Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, let's list out the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 9)>
4. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
6. <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
