Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can see that the nodes with three connections are 4, 5, 6, and 9. Let's list the 3-stars:

<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
