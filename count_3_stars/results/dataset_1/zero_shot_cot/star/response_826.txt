Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Since node 1 is connected to exactly three other nodes (2, 4, and 6), we have a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>.

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8. Since node 2 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 5, and 8), we have a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (1, 5, 8)>.

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8. Since node 4 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 6, and 7), we have a 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (1, 6, 7)>.

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7. Since node 6 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 4, and 7), we have a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (1, 4, 7)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>.
