Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of each 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. 

Here are the steps to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify the central node and its neighbors.
2. Check for each neighbor if it has two other neighbors that are not already connected to the central node. If yes, then a 3-star is formed.
3. Keep track of all unique 3-stars that are found.

Let's follow these steps:

1. Central Node 0 with neighbors 2 and 3:
   - 3-star found: <0, (2, 3, 1)>
   
2. Central Node 1 with neighbors 3, 5, and 8:
   - 3-star found: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
   
3. Central Node 2 with neighbors 0, 4, and 5:
   - 3-star found: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
   
4. Central Node 3 with neighbors 0, 1, and 5:
   - 3-star found: <3, (1, 7, 8)>
   
5. Central Node 4 with neighbors 2 and 9:
   - 3-star found: <4, (2, 6, 9)>
   
6. Central Node 5 with neighbors 1, 2, and 8:
   - 3-star found: <5, (1, 3, 8)>
   
7. Central Node 6 with neighbor 2:
   - No 3-star formed.
   
8. Central Node 7 with neighbors 3 and 9:
   - 3-star found: <7, (1, 5, 8)>
   
9. Central Node 8 with neighbors 1, 2, and 9:
   - 3-star found: <8, (1, 3, 5)>
   
10. Central Node 9 with neighbors 4, 7, and 8:
   - 3-star found: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
