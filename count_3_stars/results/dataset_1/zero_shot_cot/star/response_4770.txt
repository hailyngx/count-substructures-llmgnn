Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the graph.
In a 3-star graph, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

In this graph, the nodes with 3 edges connected to them are:
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8)

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.

Based on the central nodes identified in Step 1, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

- From Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- From Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- From Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- From Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- From Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Step 3: Output the final answer.

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>.
