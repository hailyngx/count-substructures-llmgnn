Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the candidates for the central nodes of the 3-stars.  

Candidates:  
- Node 0 (edges: 4)  
- Node 3 (edges: 4)  
- Node 7 (edges: 5)  
- Node 9 (edges: 5)  

Step 2: For each candidate central node, check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three connected nodes.

3-stars:  
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>  
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>  
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>  
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>  
- <7, (0, 3, 4)>  
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>  
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>  

Output:
