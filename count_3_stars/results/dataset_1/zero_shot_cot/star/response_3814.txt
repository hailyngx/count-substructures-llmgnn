Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
  - <0, (2, 4, 8)>

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Looking at node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Proceeding to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Considering node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 0. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Reviewing node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Moving to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to node 9. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Examining node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Considering node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
  - <8, (0, 1, 2)>

Finally, reviewing node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. As it doesn't have connections to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
