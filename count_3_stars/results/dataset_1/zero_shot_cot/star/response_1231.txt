Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-star structures. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. Central node: 1, Leaves: 7, 8, 9
2. Central node: 2, Leaves: 6, 7, 8

Therefore, there are two unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
