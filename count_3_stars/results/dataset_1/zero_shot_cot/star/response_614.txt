Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (5, 6, 7)>
2. <4, (7, 1, 9)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 2]
