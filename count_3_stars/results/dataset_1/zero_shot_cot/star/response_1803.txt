Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars present. 

Looking at the given edges, we can see that the central node of the 3-star must have exactly 3 edges connecting it to other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 0)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 1, 5)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, -)>
<8, (3, 0, 4)>
<9, (4, 7, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
