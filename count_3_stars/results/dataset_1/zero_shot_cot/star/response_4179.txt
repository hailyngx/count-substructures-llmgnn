Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 1: (0, 2, 5)
- Node 2: (1, 4, 8)
- Node 3: (6, 8, 3)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 8)
- Node 5: (1, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 3, 8)
- Node 7: (1, 7, 1)
- Node 8: (0, 2, 4)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 5)

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
