Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 0, 8

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node as a potential center:
- Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 8), (0, 4, 9), (0, 5, 8), (0, 5, 9), [5 in total]
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6), [1 in total]
- Node 2: (2, 5, 6), [1 in total]
- Node 3: (3, 4, 5), [1 in total]
- Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 3), (4, 0, 6), (4, 1, 6), [4 in total]
- Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 3), (5, 0, 6), (5, 2, 6), [4 in total]
- Node 6: (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 4), (6, 2, 4), [3 in total]
- Node 7: (2, 5, 7), [1 in total]
- Node 8: (8, 0, 9), [1 in total]
- Node 9: (9, 0, 8), [1 in total]

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
Now, listing the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 0)>
- <2, (5, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 5, 0)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 2)>
- <6, (2, 4, 1)>
- <7, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (0, 9, 8)>
- <9, (0, 8, 9)>
