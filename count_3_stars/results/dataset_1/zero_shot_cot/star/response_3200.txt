Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the given graph to find all unique 3-stars:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: (2, 6, 7)
   - Node 1: (5, 7, 8)
   - Node 2: (0, 8, 8)
   - Node 4: (8, 8, 9)
   - Node 5: (1, 8, 8)
   - Node 6: (0, 7, 8)
   - Node 7: (0, 1, 6)
   - Node 8: (1, 2, 4)

From the analysis above, we can see that there are only three unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (5, 7, 8)>
3. <8, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
