Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 9, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 6)>

So, there are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
