Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9. These connections form a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 2, 7, and 9 as the leaves. Let's denote this 3-star as <0, (2, 7, 9)>.

2. Node 1 and node 6 are not part of any 3-star configuration since they are only connected to each other.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9. These connections form two distinct 3-stars: 
    a. <2, (0, 6, 9)>
    b. <2, (4, 6, 9)>

4. Node 3 is connected to node 7, forming a 3-star <3, (7, 0, 1)>.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6, forming a 3-star <4, (2, 6, 9)>.

6. Nodes 5, 8, and 9 are not part of any 3-star configuration since they are not connected in a way that forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 0, 1)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
