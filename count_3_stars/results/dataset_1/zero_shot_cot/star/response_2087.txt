Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.  
From the given edges, the nodes and their corresponding degrees (number of edges incident to the node) are as follows:  
Node 0: 2  
Node 1: 3  
Node 2: 1  
Node 3: 5  
Node 4: 2  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 3  
Node 7: 2  
Node 8: 2  
Node 9: 5

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9 since they have a degree of 3.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to the central node.

In this graph, we can form the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars:
