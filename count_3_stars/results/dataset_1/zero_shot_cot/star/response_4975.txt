Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 
Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, -)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, -, -)>
<4, (7, -, -)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (8, -, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, -, -)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
