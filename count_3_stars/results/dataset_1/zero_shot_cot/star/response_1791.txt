Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 7, and 8: <0, (2, 7, 8)>
2. Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 9: <2, (0, 3, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
4. Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 7, and 9: <4, (3, 7, 9)>
5. Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 5, 9, and 0: <6, (5, 9, 0)>
6. Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, and 6: <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
