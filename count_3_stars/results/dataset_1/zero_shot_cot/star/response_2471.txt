Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are connected to node 0. So, node 0 is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 2, 4).
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8. Nodes 0, 1, 6, and 8 are connected to node 2. So, node 2 is also connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 1, 6).
   
2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - We found two 3-stars: (0, 1, 2) and (0, 2, 1). [2]

Therefore, the final answer is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 1, 5)>
