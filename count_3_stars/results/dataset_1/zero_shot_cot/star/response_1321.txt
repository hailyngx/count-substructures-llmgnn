Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the central nodes would have degree 3.

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 0)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
