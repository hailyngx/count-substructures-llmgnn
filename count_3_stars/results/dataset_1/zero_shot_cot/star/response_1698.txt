Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star configuration.

Given the provided edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.

We can now identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: <0, (3, 8)>
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 5)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 7)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 9)>
5. Node 4: <4, (3, 6, 7)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 7, 8)>
7. Node 6: <6, (4, 7, 9)>
8. Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 5, 6, 9)>
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 4, 5)>
10. Node 9: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
