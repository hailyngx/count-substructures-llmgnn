Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step through the process:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to three other nodes:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8.
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9.
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
    - There are no 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
