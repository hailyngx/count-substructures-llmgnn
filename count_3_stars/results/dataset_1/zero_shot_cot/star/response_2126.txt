Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (3, 4, 1)
- Node 1: (3, 8, 0)
- Node 2: (4, 0, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 8)
- Node 5: (6, 7, 4)
- Node 6: (5, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (4, 5, 6)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 6)

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph, which are <0, (3, 4, 1)>, <1, (3, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 0, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 4)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>.
