Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars found: [7].
