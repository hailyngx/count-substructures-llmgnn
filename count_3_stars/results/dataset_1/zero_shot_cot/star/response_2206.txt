Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. Node 0 with neighbors 3, 7 
2. Node 1 with neighbors 4, 6
3. Node 2 with neighbors 3, 4, 6, 8
4. Node 3 with neighbors 0, 2, 9
5. Node 4 with neighbors 1, 2, 5, 7
6. Node 6 with neighbors 1, 2, 7
7. Node 7 with neighbors 0, 4, 6
8. Node 9 with neighbors 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- There are no 3-stars with center nodes 5 or 8 because they do not have 3 neighbors.
- For node 0, there is 1 3-star: <0, (3, 7)>.
- For node 1, there is 1 3-star: <1, (4, 6)>.
- For node 2, there are 2 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 6)> and <2, (4, 6, 8)>.
- For node 3, there is 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 9)>.
- For node 4, there is 1 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 7)>.
- For node 6, there is 1 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 7)>.
- For node 7, there is 1 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 6)>.
- There are no 3-stars with center node 9 because it only has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
