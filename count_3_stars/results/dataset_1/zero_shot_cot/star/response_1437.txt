Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. A 3-star consists of a central node and exactly three other nodes that are connected to the central node. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 1:
   - Adjacent nodes: 2, 3, 7
   <1, (2, 3, 7)>

2. Central node 3:
   - Adjacent nodes: 1, 7
   <3, (1, 7)>

3. Central node 4:
   - Adjacent nodes: 6, 7
   <4, (6, 7)>

4. Central node 7:
   - Adjacent nodes: 1, 3, 4, 8
   <7, (1, 3, 4)>
   <7, (1, 4, 8)>
   <7, (3, 4, 8)>
   <7, (1, 3, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
