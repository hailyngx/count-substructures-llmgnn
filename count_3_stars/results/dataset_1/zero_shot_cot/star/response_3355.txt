Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 
Based on the provided edges, we can see the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Next, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node and exactly three leaves connected to the center node.

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 6 and 7. <0, (6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 4 and 8. <1, (4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1 and 2. <4, (1, 2)>
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star with leaves 2 and 8. <4, (2, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 1 and 5. <8, (1, 5)>
- Node 8 also forms a 3-star with leaves 4 and 9. <8, (4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 7)>, 
<1, (4, 8)>, 
<4, (1, 2)>, 
<4, (2, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 5)>, 
<8, (4, 9)>.
