Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.

2. Identify the 3-star structures <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.]
