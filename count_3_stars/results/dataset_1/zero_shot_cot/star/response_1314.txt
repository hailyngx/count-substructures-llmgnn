Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 1, which will be central nodes of the 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 1: 5, 1, 4, 8

Now, let's find and count the 3-stars in the graph by considering each central node and its adjacent nodes. 

For central node 5:
No 3-star can be formed.

For central node 1:
No 3-star can be formed.

For central node 4:
No 3-star can be formed.

For central node 8:
No 3-star can be formed.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <5, (0, _)> <1, (0, _)> <4, (2, _)> <8, (6, _)>.
