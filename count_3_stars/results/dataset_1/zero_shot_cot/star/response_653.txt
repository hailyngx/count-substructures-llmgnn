Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can act as the center of a potential 3-star. Based on the given edges, the following nodes meet this criterion:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7

Next, let's construct the 3-stars using these potential center nodes and their connected nodes:
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [4].
