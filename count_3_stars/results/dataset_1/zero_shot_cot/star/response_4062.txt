Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

To form a 3-star, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, which is characteristic of a center node in a 3-star.

Given the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
4. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
5. <8, (1, 2, 4)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
