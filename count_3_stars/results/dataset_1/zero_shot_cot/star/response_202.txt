Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars. 

Let's list out the 3-stars we can find by following the definition of a 3-star graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

By examining the graph edges, we find that there are 24 unique 3-stars. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
