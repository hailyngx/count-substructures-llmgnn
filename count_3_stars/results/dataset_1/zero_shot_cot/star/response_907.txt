Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes first.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8. Since it has 4 adjacent nodes, none of them can form a 3-star. So, node 0 is not part of any 3-star.

Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8. It can potentially be the center of a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8.

Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9. It can potentially be the center of 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 8, as well as with nodes 1, 4, and 7.

Node 3 is connected to node 1. Since it has only 1 adjacent node, it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9. It can potentially be the center of a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6.

Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6. Since it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8. Since it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. Since it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6. Since it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. Since it has fewer than 3 adjacent nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

Hence, the 3-stars in the given graph can be represented as follows:
<[1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
