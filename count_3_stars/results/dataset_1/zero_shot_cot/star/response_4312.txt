Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
    - Node 2 has edges to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
    - Node 3 has edges to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
    - Node 4 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
    - Node 8 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Step 2: List the unique 3-stars:
    1. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
    2. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
    3. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    4. <8, (2, 3, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars listed:
    [4]
