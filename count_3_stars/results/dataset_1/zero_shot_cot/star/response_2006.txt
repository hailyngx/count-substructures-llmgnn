Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 9, 6)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
