Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's go step-by-step to identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7: <1, (0, 2, 7)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7: <2, (1, 6, 7)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 6: <4, (6, 8, 6)>
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 1: <5, (1, 9, 1)>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9: <8, (0, 4, 9)>
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8: <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
