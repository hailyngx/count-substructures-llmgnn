Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars formed by each node with exactly 3 neighbors.
- For node 1: (1, 3, 6), (1, 6, 7) [<1, (3, 6, 7)>]
- For node 7: (7, 5, 6) [<7, (5, 6, 1)>]
- For node 8: No 3-star can be formed.

Step 3: Sum the counts from Step 2.
- Total number of 3-stars: [2]
