Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves, while ignoring any isolated nodes. 

The central nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars. 

<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have [5].
