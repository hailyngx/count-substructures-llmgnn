Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.  
    <0, (2, 4, 5)>
    <2, (0, 7, 8)>
    <4, (0, 1, 8)>
    <5, (0, 3, 6)>
  
Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
