Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star structures in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

There are three 3-star structures in this graph.
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
