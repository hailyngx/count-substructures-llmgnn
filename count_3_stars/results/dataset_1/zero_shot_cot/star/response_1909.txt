Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
[<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
