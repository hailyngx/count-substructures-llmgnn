Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in this given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has neighbors 3 and 8.
2. Node 1 has neighbors 3 and 7.
3. Node 2 has neighbors 5 and 9.
4. Node 3 has neighbors 0, 1, 6, and 7. We find two possible 3-stars with node 3 as the central node:
    - <3, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <3, (0, 1, 7)>
5. Node 4 has neighbors 7 and 8.
6. Node 5 has neighbor 2.
7. Node 6 has neighbor 3.
8. Node 7 has neighbors 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8. There are two possible 3-stars with node 7 as the central node:
    - <7, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 6)>
9. Node 8 has neighbors 0, 4, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 has neighbors 2 and 8.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
