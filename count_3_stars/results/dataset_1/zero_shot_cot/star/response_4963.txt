Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its neighbors for each potential 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found gives us a total of [7].
