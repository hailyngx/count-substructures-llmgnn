Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one to look for 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star <0, (3, 8, 9)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 3. This does not form a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. This does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. This forms a 3-star <3, (0, 1, 2)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star <4, (3, 6, 7)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. This does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star <6, (2, 4, 5)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 4. This does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. This does not form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. This forms three 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, and <9, (6, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>.
