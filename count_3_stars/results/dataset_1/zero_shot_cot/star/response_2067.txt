Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

1. Start by listing all nodes and their connections:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 6
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - There is one 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 4, and 5 as the leaves: <1, (0, 4, 5)>

Thus, the final answer is [1].
