Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

1. Central node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9)
    <0, (1, 4, 5)> [1]
    <0, (1, 8, 9)> [2]
    
2. Central node 1: (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 9)
    <1, (0, 7, 9)> [3]

3. Central node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)
    <2, (3, 5, 6)> [4]

4. Central node 3: (3, 2), (3, 5)
    <3, (2, 5, X)> [5]

5. Central node 4: (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 8)
    No 3-stars for central node 4.

6. Central node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7)
    <5, (0, 2, 3)> [6]
    <5, (0, 2, 7)> [7]

7. Central node 6: (6, 2), (6, 4)
    No 3-stars for central node 6.

8. Central node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9)
    <7, (1, 2, 5)> [8]
    
9. Central node 8: (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 9)
    <8, (0, 4, 9)> [9]

10. Central node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 8)
    <9, (0, 1, 7)> [10]

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

[<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, X)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>]
