Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, -)>
<5, (3, -, -)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, -, -)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
[Count: 10]
