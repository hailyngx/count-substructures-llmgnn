Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it. We are looking for nodes with exactly three incident edges, which represent the central nodes of 3-stars.

Here are the steps to identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. List out the nodes along with the incident edges:

- Node 0: (0, 3) - Degree: 1
- Node 1: (1, 4) - Degree: 1
- Node 2: (2, 7) - Degree: 1
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 8) - Degree: 2
- Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 5) - Degree: 2
- Node 5: (5, 4) - Degree: 1
- Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 8) - Degree: 2
- Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 9) - Degree: 3
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 6) - Degree: 2
- Node 9: (9, 7) - Degree: 1

2. Identify the nodes with degree 3 (where degree is the number of incident edges) since the central nodes in the 3-stars will have a degree of exactly 3.

From the list above, we see that Node 7 has a degree of 3, which means it is a central node of a 3-star.

3. Now, we need to find the leaves connected to the central node.
- For Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 9)

We have found one 3-star centered at Node 7: <7, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

<7, (2, 6, 9)>
