Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list all the 3-stars with their central node and leaves:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3)>

Next, we count the total number of unique 3-stars.
