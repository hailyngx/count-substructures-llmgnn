Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with three edges connected to them. These will be the potential central nodes of the 3-stars.
    - Node 0 has 6 edges connected to it.
    - Node 4 has 5 edges connected to it.
    - Node 6 has 5 edges connected to it.

Step 2: For each potential central node, count how many 3-stars can be formed.
    - For node 0: 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
    - For node 4: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
    - For node 6: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars

Step 3: Sum up the total number of 3-stars.
    Total = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, [<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 9, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>] [40]
