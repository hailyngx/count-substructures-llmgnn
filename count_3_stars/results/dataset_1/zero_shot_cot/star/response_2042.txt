Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all unique occurrences of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes in a star configuration.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, -)>
<9, (4, 5, -)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
