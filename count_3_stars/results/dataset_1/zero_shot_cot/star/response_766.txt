Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (4, 8)>
 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
