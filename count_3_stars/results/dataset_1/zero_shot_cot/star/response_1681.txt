Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each unique combination of a center node and its three connected nodes.

Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (2, 8, 8)>
   
2. For node 1:
   - <1, (6, 9, 9)>

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 8, 8)>
   - <2, (9, 8, 9)>

4. For node 3:
   - <3, (5, 9, 5)>

5. For node 4:
   - <4, (6, 9, 6)>

6. For node 5:
   - <5, (3, 9, 3)>
   - <5, (6, 9, 6)>

7. For node 6:
   - <6, (1, 9, 1)>
   - <6, (4, 9, 4)>
   - <6, (5, 9, 5)>
   - <6, (7, 9, 7)>

8. For node 7:
   - <7, (6, 9, 6)>
   - <7, (8, 9, 8)>

9. For node 8:
   - <8, (0, 2, 0)>
   - <8, (7, 9, 7)>
   - <8, (9, 7, 9)>

10. For node 9:
   - <9, (1, 2, 1)>
   - <9, (2, 8, 2)>
   - <9, (3, 5, 3)>
   - <9, (4, 6, 4)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 5)>
   - <9, (6, 7, 6)>
   - <9, (7, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18] in this graph.
