Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then identify the unique 3-stars based on those nodes. 

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 2. So, <0, (4, 9, 2)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6. So, <4, (0, 2, 6)> is another 3-star.
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. So, <6, (3, 4, 5)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8. So, <9, (0, 6, 8)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 

So, the final answer is [4].
