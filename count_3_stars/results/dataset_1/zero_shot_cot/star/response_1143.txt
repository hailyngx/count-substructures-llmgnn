Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes and their neighbors.
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Step 2: Look for all possible 3-stars.
- Potential 3-stars will have the center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
- There are [2] unique 3-stars.

<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
