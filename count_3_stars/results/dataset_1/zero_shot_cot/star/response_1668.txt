Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's begin by identifying the central node for each 3-star:
- For node 0: None
- For node 1: (1, 3, 6, 8)
- For node 2: None
- For node 3: (3, 1, 5, 8)
- For node 4: (4, 2, 5, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- For node 6: (6, 1, 5, 7, 8)
- For node 7: (7, 2, 5, 6, 8)
- For node 8: (8, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9)
- For node 9: None

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (1, 3, 6, 8)>
<3, (3, 1, 5, 8)>
<4, (4, 2, 5, 8)>
<5, (5, 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)>
<6, (6, 1, 5, 7, 8)>
<7, (7, 2, 5, 6, 8)>
<8, (8, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
