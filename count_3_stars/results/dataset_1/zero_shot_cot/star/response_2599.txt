Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible 3-stars can be formed using the central node and its 3 neighbors. Let's examine each node and its neighbors to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
   - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
   
2. Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7}
   - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <1, (0, 3, 7)>
   
3. Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}
   - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
   
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 7)>
   
5. Node 4: Neighbors {5, 7, 9}
   - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
   
6. Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 8}
   - <5, (0, 4, 8)>
   
7. Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2}
   - <6, (0, 2, 0)>
   
8. Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}
   - <7, (0, 1, 4)>
   
9. Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9}
   - <8, (5, 9, 4)>
   
10. Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}
   - <9, (4, 8, 5)>
   
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 0)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <9, (4, 8, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
