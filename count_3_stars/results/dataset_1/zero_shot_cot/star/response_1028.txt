Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, you need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7 and 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4], and they are:
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 7)>
<6, (7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9)>
