Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Nodes with three connections:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.

2. Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
