Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then form 3-stars with these nodes as the centers and their adjacent nodes as the leaves. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
