Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Upon analyzing the provided edges, we can see that there are two 3-star structures in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
