Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

First, we will identify the central nodes by checking which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following central nodes:
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 7)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 7)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 9)

Now, we will list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
