Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
    - In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
    
Step 2: Find the unique 3-stars in the graph.
    - The possible 3-stars can have center nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
    
Unique 3-stars found:
    <0, (4, 6, 7)>
    <1, (6, 7, 8)>
    <2, (5, 6, -)>
    <3, (5, 7, -)>
    <4, (0, 7, -)>
    <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    <6, (0, 1, 2)>
    <7, (0, 1, 3)>
    <8, (1, -,-)>
  
Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
    Count = 8
