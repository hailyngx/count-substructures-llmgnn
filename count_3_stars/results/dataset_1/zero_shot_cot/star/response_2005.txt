Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

First, let's list all the edges in a more organized manner:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 2: (0, 2)
- Node 1 is connected to Node 6: (1, 6), Node 8: (1, 8)
- Node 2 is connected to Node 0: (2, 0)
- Node 4 is connected to Node 6: (4, 6), Node 7: (4, 7)
- Node 5 is connected to Node 8: (5, 8)
- Node 6 is connected to Node 1: (6, 1), Node 4: (6, 4), Node 9: (6, 9)
- Node 7 is connected to Node 4: (7, 4)
- Node 8 is connected to Node 1: (8, 1), Node 5: (8, 5)
- Node 9 is connected to Node 6: (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs in this graph:

1. <1, (6, 8, 9)>
2. <4, (6, 7, -)>
3. <8, (1, 5, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
