Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0 and 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5 and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 7: Connected to node 5
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6
- Node 9: Connected to node 4

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[6]

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 0)>
