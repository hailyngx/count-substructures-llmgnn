Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

1. For node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. For node 1: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. For node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)> and <2, (3, 5, 7)>
4. For node 3: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
5. For node 4: <4, (0, 1, 7)>
6. For node 5: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
7. For node 6: <6, (7, 8)>
8. For node 7: <7, (1, 4, 5)> and <7, (6, 8)>
9. For node 8: <8, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
