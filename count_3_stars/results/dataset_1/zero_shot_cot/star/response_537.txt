Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 5, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
