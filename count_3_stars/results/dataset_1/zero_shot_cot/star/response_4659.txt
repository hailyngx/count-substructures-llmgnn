Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. We'll look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 1 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 3 edges
- Node 7 has 4 edges
- Node 8 has 4 edges

Next, for each central node, we'll look for the connected nodes to form the 3-star structures:
- For Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 8)
- For Node 2: (2, 1, 6), (2, 1, 8)
- For Node 7: (7, 3, 6), (7, 3, 8), (7, 6, 8)
- For Node 8: (8, 1, 2), (8, 1, 7), (8, 2, 7), (8, 7, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
