Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and count the number of 3-stars it is a part of. 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9. (0, 3, 4, 8) forms a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9. (1, 2, 7, 8) forms a 3-star.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8. (2, 1, 3, 8) forms a 3-star.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8. (3, 0, 2, 4) forms a 3-star.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. There are no 3-stars involving node 4.
- Nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9 do not form 3-stars with any other nodes based on the given edges.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the output is [4].
