Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges.

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
