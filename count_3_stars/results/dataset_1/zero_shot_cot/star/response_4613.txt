Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to it, let's find the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the center of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0 has 5 edges (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8)
- Node 2 has 4 edges (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)
- Node 5 has 5 edges (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 edges (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3)
- Node 8 has 3 edges (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5)
- Node 9 has 3 edges (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
