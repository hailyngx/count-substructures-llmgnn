Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (8, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 5)>
3. <2, (1, 5)>
4. <4, (1, 6)>
5. <9, (0, 2)>
6. <9, (3, 4)>
7. <9, (6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
