Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
5. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <7, (2, 3, 4)>
8. <8, (0, 2, 5)>
9. <9, (6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
