Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on this information.

The nodes with three connections are:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8.

Now we can list the unique 3-stars using the information above:
1. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (3, 6, 7)>
3. <4, (1, 5, 7)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 8)>
5. <8, (1, 2, 3)>
6. <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
