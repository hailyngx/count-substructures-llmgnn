Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central node needs to have 3 edges connecting it to 3 other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 0: <0, (1, 4, 9)>
2. Central node 1: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
3. Central node 2: <2, (3, 6, 9)>
4. Central node 3: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
5. Central node 6: <6, (2, 3, 9)>
6. Central node 7: <7, (1, 3, 8)>
7. Central node 9: <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
