Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node (center) and its adjacent nodes (leaves). A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three leaf nodes.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 4, -)>
5. <4, (0, 3, -)>
6. <5, (0, 8, 9)>
7. <6, (5, -, -)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 5)>
9. <9, (0, 5, -)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. The final answer inside brackets is [9].
