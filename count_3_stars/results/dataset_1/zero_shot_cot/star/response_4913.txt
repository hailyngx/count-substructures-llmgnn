Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
1. Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 5, and 8 <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 3 <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 8 <2, (1, 3, 8)>
4. Node 3 has connections with nodes 1, 2, and 8 <3, (1, 2, 8)>
5. Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 1, and 7 <5, (0, 1, 7)>
6. Node 7 has connections with nodes 3, 5, and 8 <7, (3, 5, 8)>
7. Node 8 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 7 <8, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
