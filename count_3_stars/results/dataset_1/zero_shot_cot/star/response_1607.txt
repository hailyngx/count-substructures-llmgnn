Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 9)
- From node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 5)
- From node 3: (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 8)
- From node 4: (4, 0, 3)
- From node 5: (5, 2, 7)
- From node 7: (7, 5, 8)
- From node 8: (8, 1, 3), (8, 3, 7)
- From node 9: (9, 0, 0)

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the graph as shown above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 0)>, <5, (2, 7, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 0, 0)>
