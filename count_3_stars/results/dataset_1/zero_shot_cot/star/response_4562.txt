Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes in a 3-star graph have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Calculating the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 1
- Node 2: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 1
- Node 9: degree = 4

From the degrees, the central nodes are 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars:

<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
