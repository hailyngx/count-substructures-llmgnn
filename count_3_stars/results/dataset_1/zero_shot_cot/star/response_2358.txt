Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by looking for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

We notice that there are four central nodes in the graph: 0, 1, 2, 9. Let's list the 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 0: (0, 7, 8, 9)
- For node 1: (1, 2, 6, 7), (1, 6, 7, 9)
- For node 2: (2, 1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 5, 7)
- For node 9: (9, 1, 5, 6), (9, 6, 7, 0)

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
