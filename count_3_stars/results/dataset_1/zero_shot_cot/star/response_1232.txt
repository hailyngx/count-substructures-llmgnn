Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9)  
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 9)  
<1, (0, 2, 9)>

3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4)  
No 3-star

4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 7)  
No 3-star

5. Node 4: (4, 2)  
No 3-star

6. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 8)  
<6, (0, 8, 7)>

7. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 8)  
<7, (0, 8, 6)>

8. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 7)  
No 3-star

9. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1)  
No 3-star

The unique 3-stars identified are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 7)>, <7, (0, 8, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
