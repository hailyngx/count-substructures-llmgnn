Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.

Potential centers: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Step 2: For each potential center, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, form a 3-star.
Let's go through each potential center one by one.

1. For center node 0:
   - Connected to: 3, 5, 9
   <0, (3, 5, 9)>

2. For center node 2:
   - Connected to: 7, 9
   Not connected to exactly three other nodes.

3. For center node 4:
   - Connected to: 6, 7, 8
   <4, (6, 7, 8)>

4. For center node 5:
   - Connected to: 6, 8, 9
   Not connected to exactly three other nodes.

5. For center node 6:
   - Connected to: 4, 5, 9
   <6, (4, 5, 9)>

6. For center node 7:
   - Connected to: 2, 4, 9
   <7, (2, 4, 9)>

7. For center node 8:
   - Connected to: 4, 5
   Not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars identified.
   - Total 3-stars: 3
