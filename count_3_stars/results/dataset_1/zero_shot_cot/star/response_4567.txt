Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0: No 3-star can be formed using node 0 since it has only one edge.
2. Node 1: No 3-star can be formed using node 1 since it has only one edge.
3. Node 2: Possible 3-stars involving node 2 are <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>.
4. Node 3: No 3-star can be formed using node 3 since it has only two edges.
5. Node 4: Possible 3-stars involving node 4 are <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.
6. Node 5: No 3-star can be formed using node 5 since it has only two edges.
7. Node 6: No 3-star can be formed using node 6 since it has only one edge.
8. Node 7: No 3-star can be formed using node 7 since it has only two edges.
9. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed using node 8 since it has only one edge.
10. Node 9: Possible 3-stars involving node 9 are <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.
