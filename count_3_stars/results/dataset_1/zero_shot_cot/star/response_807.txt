Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three other nodes connected to it. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has edges with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9. However, it needs exactly 3 edges to form a 3-star. So, node 0 doesn't form any 3-star.

2. Node 1 has edges with 0, 6, and 7. Since it has exactly 3 edges, the 3-star with node 1 as the center is <1, (0, 6, 7)>.

3. Node 2 has edges with 0, 3, and 8. Since it has exactly 3 edges, the 3-star with node 2 as the center is <2, (0, 3, 8)>.

4. Node 3 has edges with 0, 2, and 4. Since it has exactly 3 edges, the 3-star with node 3 as the center is <3, (0, 2, 4)>.

5. Node 4 has edges with only node 0, so it doesn't form any 3-star.

6. Node 5 has edges with 7 and 8. Since it doesn't have exactly 3 edges connected to it, it doesn't form a 3-star.

7. Node 6 has edges with 1 and 9. Since it doesn't have exactly 3 edges connected to it, it doesn't form a 3-star.

8. Node 7 has edges with 1 and 5. Since it doesn't have exactly 3 edges connected to it, it doesn't form a 3-star.

9. Node 8 has edges with 2, 5, and 9. Since it has exactly 3 edges, the 3-star with node 8 as the center is <8, (2, 5, 9)>.

10. Node 9 has edges with 0, 6, and 8. Since it has exactly 3 edges, the 3-star with node 9 as the center is <9, (0, 6, 8)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
