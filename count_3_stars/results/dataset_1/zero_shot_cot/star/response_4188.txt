Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 9, )>
<9, (8, )>

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
