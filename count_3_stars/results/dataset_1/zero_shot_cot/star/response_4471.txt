Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

By definition, a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's look at each node to see if it forms any 3-stars with its adjacent nodes.

1. Node 0:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

2. Node 1:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 2:
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <2, (4, 5, 7)>.

4. Node 3:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 4:
   - Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 8: <4, (2, 5, 8)>.

6. Node 5:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 6:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

8. Node 7:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 8:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9:
   - Does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (4, 5, 7)> and <4, (2, 5, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
