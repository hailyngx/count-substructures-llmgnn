Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 0, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[5]
