Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star and then count them.
  
Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:
  
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
  
Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
