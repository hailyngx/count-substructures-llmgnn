Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each potential 3-star.

The possible 3-star formations can involve the central node being connected to three other nodes by edges. Let's list the nodes connected to each node as below (excluding the central node):

- 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- 1: 0, 6
- 2: 0, 3, 8
- 3: 0, 2, 5, 6
- 4: 7, 9
- 5: 3, 8, 9
- 6: 0, 1, 3, 8
- 7: 4
- 8: 2, 5, 6
- 9: 0, 4, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>

Finally, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [7].
