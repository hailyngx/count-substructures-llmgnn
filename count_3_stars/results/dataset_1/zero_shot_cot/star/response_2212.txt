Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.]
