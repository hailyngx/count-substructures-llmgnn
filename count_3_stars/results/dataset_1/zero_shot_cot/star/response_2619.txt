Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars.  

The nodes that fit this criteria are: 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Step 2: For each potential center node, identify the nodes that are directly connected to it. These will be the leaves of the 3-stars.  

For node 4: Connected to 3, 6, 8, 9  
For node 6: Connected to 2, 3, 4, 8, 9  
For node 8: Connected to 0, 4, 6, 7  
For node 9: Connected to 4, 6  

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.  

<4, (3, 6, 8)>  
<4, (3, 6, 9)>  
<4, (6, 8, 9)>  
<6, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (2, 4, 9)>  

Step 4: [Count the total number of unique 3-stars.]
