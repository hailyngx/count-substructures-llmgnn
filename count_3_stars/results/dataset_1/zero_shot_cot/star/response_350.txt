Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that make up each 3-star in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to node 0.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<2, (3, 7)>
<3, (2, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
