Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 0, since a 3-star graph requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.  
Node 0 is connected to node 3.  

Thus, we have the following 3-star centered at node 0:  
<0, (3)>  

Next, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 1.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.  

Thus, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 1:  
<1, (2, 8)>  

Next, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 2.  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.  

Thus, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 2:  
<2, (1, 7)>  

Next, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 3.  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.  

Thus, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 3:  
<3, (0, 6, 7)>  

Finally, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 8.  
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9.  

Thus, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 8:  
<8, (1, 5, 6)>  
<8, (1, 7, 9)>  

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
