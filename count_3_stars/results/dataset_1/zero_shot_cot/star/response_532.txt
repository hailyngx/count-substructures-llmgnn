Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 2

Nodes 4, 5, and 6 are the only nodes with degree 4, and they can potentially form the center of a 3-star with the remaining nodes connected to them.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [3].
