Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only one other node (Node 8).
2. Node 1: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only one other node (Node 7).
3. Node 2: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes (Nodes 7 and 8).
4. Node 3: Forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 8, 9)>.
5. Node 4: Forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 9, 8)>.
6. Node 5: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes (Nodes 6 and 9).
7. Node 6: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only one other node (Node 5).
8. Node 7: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes (Nodes 1 and 2).
9. Node 8: Forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 9)>.
10. Node 9: Forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 9, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, and <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
