Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The possible 3-stars can be formed using the central node and its three connected nodes:
- 3-star with node 0: (0, 3, 4, 5)
- 3-star with node 2: (2, 3, 5, 6)
- 3-star with node 3: (3, 0, 2, 4)
- 3-star with node 4: (4, 0, 3, 5)
- 3-star with node 5: (5, 0, 2, 4)
- 3-star with node 6: (6, 2, 3, 8)
- 3-star with node 8: (8, 4, 6, 7)
- 3-star with node 9: (9, 2, 3, 4)

Let's count the unique 3-stars and output the answer in brackets at the end. 

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
