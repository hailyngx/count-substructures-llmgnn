Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Central nodes: 2, 7, 8, 9

Step 2: For each central node, identify the adjacent nodes to form 3-stars.

<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
