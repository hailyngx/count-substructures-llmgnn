Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, we list out the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: (0, 5)
- Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 9), (9, 1)
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2)
- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 4), (8, 4)
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (0, 5)
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 9), (9, 6), (3, 6)
- Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9), (2, 7), (3, 7), (9, 7)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)
- Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 0, 8)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (6, 7, 1)>
<9, (8, 3, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
