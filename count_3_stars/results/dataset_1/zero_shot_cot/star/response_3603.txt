Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars and then count them:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, -)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 7, -)>
<6, (3, 8, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (2, 6, -)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
