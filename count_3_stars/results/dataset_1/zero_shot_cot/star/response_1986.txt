Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars with one central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 5, 0)>
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
<2, (8, 4, 0)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 0)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 1, 0)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

There are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
