Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list all the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 9, -)>
<6, (4, 7, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (3, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 
[8]
