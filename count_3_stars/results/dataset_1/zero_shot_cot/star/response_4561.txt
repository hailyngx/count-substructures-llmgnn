Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We can identify a 3-star by looking at each node in the graph and checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (6, 8, -)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
