Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes in each 3-star. We will list each 3-star along with its central node and the three leaf nodes.

1. <0, (1, 4, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 8, _)> (Note: Node 4 is only connected to nodes 0 and 8, so one leaf node is missing. This is not a complete 3-star)
6. <5, (2, 8, _)> (Note: Node 5 is only connected to nodes 2 and 8, so one leaf node is missing. This is not a complete 3-star)
7. <6, (2, _, _)>
8. <7, (3, 9, _)>
9. <8, (2, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
