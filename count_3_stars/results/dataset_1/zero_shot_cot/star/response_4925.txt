Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph, we can start by identifying the 3-stars within it. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, _)> (This 3-star is incomplete as node 2 only has 2 neighbors)
<3, (2, 6, _)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (4, 5, _)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
