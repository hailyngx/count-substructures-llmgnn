Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we can look for nodes with 3 neighbors.

Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the 3-stars:

1. Find nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 has neighbors {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
   - Node 2 has neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6}
   - Node 3 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}
   - Node 6 has neighbors {1, 2, 4, 9}

2. Identify 3-star patterns:
   - Nodes 2, 1, 3 form a 3-star <2, (1, 3)>
   - Nodes 6, 1, 9 form a 3-star <6, (1, 9)>
   - Nodes 4, 2, 6 form a 3-star <4, (2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (1, 3)>, <6, (1, 9)>, <4, (2, 6)>.
