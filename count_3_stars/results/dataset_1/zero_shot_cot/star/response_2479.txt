Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 4)
4. Node 4: (4, 2, 7), (4, 2, 8)
5. Node 6: (6, 1, 8)
6. Node 8: (8, 4, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars found:

[6] 
   
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 0)>, <1, (0, 6, 1)>, <2, (0, 3, 2)>, <2, (0, 4, 2)>, <4, (2, 7, 4)>, <4, (2, 8, 4)>, <6, (1, 8, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>
