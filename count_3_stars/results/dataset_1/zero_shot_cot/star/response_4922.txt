Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 6
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
   - Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 8
   - Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 6
   - Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
   - Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5

2. Check if any of these nodes form a 3-star pattern:
   - Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 6), (0, 4, 6)
   - Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 8), (2, 3, 8)
   - Node 3: (3, 2, 6), (3, 2, 8), (3, 6, 8)
   - Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 6), (4, 1, 6)

3. Count the unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <2, (0, 3, 8)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
