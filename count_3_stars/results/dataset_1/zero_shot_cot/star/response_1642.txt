Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the central nodes in the graph and check how many of them are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central nodes are: 
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
