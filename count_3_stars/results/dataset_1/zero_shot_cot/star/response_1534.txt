Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
6. <8, (1, 2, 5)>
7. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [7].
