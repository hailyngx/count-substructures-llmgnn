Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-star configurations. 

The 3-stars can have the following configurations:
1. <0, (1, 7, 0)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (5, 9, 3)>
4. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
5. <6, (1, 9, 6)>
6. <7, (0, 1, 0)>
7. <8, (5, 5, 5)>
8. <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star configuration:

- <0, (1, 7, 0)> occurs once.
- <1, (0, 5, 6)> occurs twice.
- <3, (5, 9, 3)> occurs once.
- <5, (1, 3, 8)> occurs once.
- <6, (1, 9, 6)> occurs once.
- <7, (0, 1, 0)> occurs once.
- <8, (5, 5, 5)> does not exist in the graph.
- <9, (3, 5, 6)> occurs once.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
