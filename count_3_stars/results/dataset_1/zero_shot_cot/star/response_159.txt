Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each set of 3 nodes where one node (the center) is connected to the other two nodes (leaves) by edges.

By examining the given edges and the connections between nodes, we can find the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 5)>
<1, (2, 4)>
<1, (2, 7)>
<1, (4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1)>
<2, (3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5)>
<3, (7, 8)>
<3, (5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3)>
<5, (6, 9)>
<6, (4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3)>
<8, (2, 7)>
<9, (3, 5)>

We have found 16 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
