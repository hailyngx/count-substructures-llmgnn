Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars present in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Given the graph, we can observe that the possible 3-star configurations are as follows:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (4, 8)>
<7, (0, 5)>
<8, (6)>
<9, (4)>

Now, we determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique configurations identified, resulting in: [9].
