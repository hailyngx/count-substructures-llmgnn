Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

To find a 3-star, we need to identify a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- For node 0: (0, 3), (0, 8) - Node 0 does not form a 3-star.
- For node 1: (1, 6), (1, 7) - Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
- For node 2: (2, 4), (2, 9) - Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
- For node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 8) - Node 3 forms a 3-star <3, (0, 4, 8)>.
- For node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5) - Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
- For node 5: (5, 4), (5, 9) - Node 5 does not form a 3-star.
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 8) - Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
- For node 7: (7, 1), (7, 9) - Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
- For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6) - Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (0, 3, 6)>.
- For node 9: (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7) - Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <3, (0, 4, 8)> and <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
