Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances of 3-stars in the graph.

In a 3-star graph, each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
