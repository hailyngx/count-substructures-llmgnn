Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes in this graph can be nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9 since each of these nodes has exactly three neighbors. Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For central node 0:
    - It forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 8, 9: <0, (6, 8, 9)>

2. For central node 2:
    - It forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 4, 6: <2, (3, 4, 6)>

3. For central node 4:
    - It forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 7, 9: <4, (2, 7, 9)>
    - It forms another 3-star with nodes 8, 7, 0: <4, (8, 7, 0)>

4. For central node 6:
    - It forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, 5: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
    - It forms another 3-star with nodes 7, 4, 5: <6, (7, 4, 5)>

5. For central node 7:
    - It forms 3-stars with nodes 4, 6, 8: <7, (4, 6, 8)>

6. For central node 8:
    - It forms another 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 0: <8, (4, 7, 0)>

7. For central node 9:
    - It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 9: <9, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
