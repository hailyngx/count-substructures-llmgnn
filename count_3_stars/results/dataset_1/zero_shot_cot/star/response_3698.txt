Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:

1. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. <2, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <4, (9, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
