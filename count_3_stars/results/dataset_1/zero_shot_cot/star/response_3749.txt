Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9)
Central Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)
Central Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7)
Central Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3)
Central Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[5]

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 0, 1)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
