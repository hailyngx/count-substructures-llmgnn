Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 since the center node can be any node in the graph. From the given edges, we can see that node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.

Now, let's look at the possible 3-stars with the center node as 0:
1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 8)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.

Now, let's look at the possible 3-stars with the center node as 1:
1. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 7)>
3. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
4. <1, (3, 4, 7)>

Since we don't need to consider duplicates, we have a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
