Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, but it needs one more connection to form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. It can form 3-stars with nodes 2-3-5, 2-3-7, 2-5-7, and 3-5-7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9. It can form 3-stars with nodes 1-4-7 and 1-7-9.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4, but it needs one more connection to form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 3, but it needs one more connection to form a 3-star.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8. It can form 3-stars with nodes 0-1-7 and 0-7-8.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7, but it needs one more connection to form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9. It can form 3-stars with nodes 1-2-5 and 1-2-9.

Combining all the above information, we have found the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
