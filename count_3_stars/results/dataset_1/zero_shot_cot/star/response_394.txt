Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connecting to node 0 to find the 3-stars centered at node 0:
- (0, 4), (0, 7)

From the edges, we see that 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. 
So, the 3-stars centered at node 0 are <0, (4, 7)>.

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connecting to node 1:
- (1, 5), (1, 9)

From the edges, we see that 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
So, the 3-stars centered at node 1 are <1, (5, 9)>.

There are no 3-stars centered at nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 because they do not have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 7)>, <1, (5, 9)>.
