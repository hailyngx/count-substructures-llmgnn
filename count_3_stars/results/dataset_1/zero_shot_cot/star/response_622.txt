Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. To find all the 3-stars, we need to consider each node and its neighbors.

Based on the given edges, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is not a part of any 3-star because it has only 2 neighbors (2, 3).
- Node 1 is not a part of any 3-star because it has only 2 neighbors (8, 9).
- Node 2 is a part of one 3-star with nodes (0, 3, 5) as leaves: <2, (0, 3, 5)>.
- Node 3 is a part of one 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 7) as leaves: <3, (0, 2, 7)>.
- Node 4 is not a part of any 3-star because it has only 2 neighbors (6, 9).
- Node 5 is not a part of any 3-star because it has only 2 neighbors (2, 8).
- Node 6 is not a part of any 3-star because it has only 2 neighbors (4, 7).
- Node 7 is a part of one 3-star with nodes (2, 3, 9) as leaves: <7, (2, 3, 9)>.
- Node 8 is not a part of any 3-star because it has only 2 neighbors (1, 5).
- Node 9 is not a part of any 3-star because it has only 2 neighbors (1, 4).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
