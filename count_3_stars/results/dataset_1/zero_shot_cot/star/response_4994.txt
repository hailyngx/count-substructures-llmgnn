Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the given edges to find all the 3-stars:
1. The center node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. The center node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
3. The center node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9: <2, (0, 6, 9)>
4. The center node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8: <3, (0, 5, 8)>
5. The center node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
6. The center node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5: <6, (1, 2, 5)>
7. The center node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5: <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
