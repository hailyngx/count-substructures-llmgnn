Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. 
The central nodes in a 3-star graph will have degree 3. Looking at the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 4 have degree 3. 

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:
1. For central node 0:
   - Leaves connected to node 0 are 5, 7, and 9. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 0 is <0, (5, 7, 9)>.
   
2. For central node 1:
   - Leaves connected to node 1 are 2, 3, and 8. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 1 is <1, (2, 3, 8)>.
   
3. For central node 4:
   - Leaves connected to node 4 are 3, 6, and 8. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 4 is <4, (3, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, and <4, (3, 6, 8)>.
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
