Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9. <5, (0, 6, 9)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7. <6, (3, 4, 7)>
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7. <8, (1, 3, 7)>
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7. <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
