Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph. 

Nodes connected to node 0: {4, 8}
Nodes connected to node 1: {3, 7}
Nodes connected to node 2: {6, 7}
Nodes connected to node 3: {1}
Nodes connected to node 4: {0}
Nodes connected to node 6: {2, 7, 9}
Nodes connected to node 7: {1, 2, 6}
Nodes connected to node 8: {0}
Nodes connected to node 9: {6}

Now, let's list all possible 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8)>  
<1, (3, 7)>  
<2, (6, 7)>  
<3, (1)>  
<4, (0)>  
<6, (2, 7, 9)>  
<7, (1, 2, 6)>  

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
