Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have connections to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph for 3-star configurations step by step:

1. Node 0: Connected to 3 nodes (5, 8, 9)
    - 3-star: <0, (5, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1: Connected to 2 nodes (3, 4)

3. Node 2: Connected to 2 nodes (3, 5)

4. Node 3: Connected to 4 nodes (1, 2, 7, 9)
    - 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 9)>

5. Node 4: Connected to 4 nodes (1, 5, 7, 9)
    - 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 9)>

6. Node 5: Connected to 6 nodes (0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9)
    - 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 8)>
    - 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
    - 3-star: <5, (0, 7, 8)>
    - 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
    - 3-star: <5, (2, 7, 8)>
    - 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 8)>

7. Node 6: Connected to 1 node (7)

8. Node 7: Connected to 6 nodes (3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
   
9. Node 8: Connected to 3 nodes (0, 5, 7)
    - 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 7)>

10. Node 9: Connected to 5 nodes (0, 3, 4, 5)
    - 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
