Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

From the information provided, we can see that some nodes have three edges incident on them, which forms 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
