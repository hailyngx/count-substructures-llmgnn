Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:
1. Identify nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each valid node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.

3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, -)>
- <4, (6, 8, -)>
- <7, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, -)>, <4, (6, 8, -)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>>.
