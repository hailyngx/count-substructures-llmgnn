Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances will represent 3-stars. Let's determine the number of 3-stars.

Looking at the provided edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
