Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
