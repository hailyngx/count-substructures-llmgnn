Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7) <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 9) <1, (5, 9, -)>
3. Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9) <2, (6, 8, 9)>
4. Node 3: (3, 7) <3, (7, -, -)>
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 9) <4, (0, 9, -)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1) <5, (0, 1, -)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2) <6, (0, 2, -)>
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3) <7, (0, 3, -)>
9. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 9) <8, (2, 9, -)>
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 8) <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
