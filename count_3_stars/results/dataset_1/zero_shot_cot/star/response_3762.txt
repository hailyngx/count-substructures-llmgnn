Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we can identify the center node of each potential 3-star by looking for nodes with exactly three incident edges. In this case, nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8 fit this criterion. 

Next, we can find the neighbors of each potential center node to determine if they form 3-stars. 

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 6)> 
- 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 7)> 
- 3-star: <0, (1, 6, 8)> 
- 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 7)> 
- 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 8)> 
- 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 8)> 

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 0, 6, 7
- 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 7)> 

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 0, 5, 8
- 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 8)> 

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 0, 5, 8
- 3-star: <7, (0, 5, 8)> 

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 0, 6, 7
- 3-star: <8, (0, 6, 7)> 

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>.
