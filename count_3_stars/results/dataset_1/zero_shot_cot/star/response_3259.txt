Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 5)>
<1, (6, 2, 5)>
<1, (9, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 7, 6)>
<3, (8, 6, 9)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 6)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 9, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 1, 8)>
<9, (7, 1, 5)>

There are 26 unique 3-stars in total.
Therefore, the final answer is [26].
