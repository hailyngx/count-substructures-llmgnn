Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
1. Identify the center nodes:
    - Node 0 has 2 edges
    - Node 1 has 2 edges
    - Node 2 has 3 edges
    - Node 3 has 4 edges
    - Node 4 has 5 edges
    - Node 5 has 3 edges
    - Node 6 has 2 edges
    - Node 7 has 6 edges
    - Node 9 has 1 edge

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
    - Number of 3-stars = Number of edges connected to the center node
    - Center nodes with their corresponding number of 3-stars:
        - Node 0: 2 3-stars
            - <0, (3, 6, X)>
        - Node 1: 2 3-stars
            - <1, (4, 7, X)>
        - Node 2: 3 3-stars
            - <2, (4, 5, 7)>
        - Node 3: 4 3-stars
            - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
            - <3, (4, 5, 7)>
            - <3, (5, 2, 7)>
            - <3, (7, 4, X)>
        - Node 4: 5 3-stars
            - <4, (1, 2, 7)>
            - <4, (2, 5, 7)>
            - <4, (3, 1, 7)>
            - <4, (3, 2, 5)>
            - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
        - Node 5: 3 3-stars
            - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
            - <5, (3, 4, 6)>
            - <5, (6, 0, X)>
        - Node 6: 2 3-stars
            - <6, (0, 5, X)>
        - Node 7: 6 3-stars
            - <7, (1, 2, 4)>
            - <7, (2, 4, 5)>
            - <7, (3, 0, 5)>
            - <7, (3, 4, 5)>
            - <7, (3, 5, 2)>
            - <7, (4, 2, 3)>
        - Node 9: 1 3-star
            - <9, (7, X, X)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 28

[<0, (3, 6, X)>, <1, (4, 7, X)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 2, 7)>, <3, (7, 4, X)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 1, 7)>, <4, (3, 2, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (6, 0, X)>, <6, (0, 5, X)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 0, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 2)>, <7, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (7, X, X)>]
