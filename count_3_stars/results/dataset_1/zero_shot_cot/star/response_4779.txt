Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node to see if there are any 3-stars in the graph.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
Node 1 is connected to node 6.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
Node 4 is connected to node 3.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
Node 7 is connected to node 5.
Node 8 is connected to node 3.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

Now, let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
