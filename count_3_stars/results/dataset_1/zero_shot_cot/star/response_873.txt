Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting from each node in the graph, we check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration. We then list these unique 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (6)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
