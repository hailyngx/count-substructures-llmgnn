Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes form the center of a 3-star in the graph. 
From the provided edges, among the 10 nodes, the nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 2, 4, 6)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 3, 9)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 2, 5, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 3, 6)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 5, 7)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6. (<1, (2, 4, 6)>)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9. (<2, (1, 3, 9)>)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9. (<3, (2, 5, 9)>)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6. (<5, (0, 3, 6)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7. (<6, (1, 5, 7)>)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4. (<9, (2, 3, 4)>)

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
