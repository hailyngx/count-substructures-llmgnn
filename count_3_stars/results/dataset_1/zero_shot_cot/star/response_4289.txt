Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node for each potential 3-star in the graph. 
The central node will be the node with exactly 3 incident edges. 

From the given edge list, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8 are the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. 

Next, let's identify the leaf nodes connected to each central node: 
- For central node 0, the leaf nodes are 6 and 8. 
- For central node 3, the leaf nodes are 1, 6, and 8.
- For central node 6, the leaf nodes are 0, 3, and 8. 
- For central node 8, the leaf nodes are 0, 3, and 6.

Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
