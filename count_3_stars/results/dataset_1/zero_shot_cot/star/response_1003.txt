Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 2, and 6.  
   <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9. Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 2, and 4.
   <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7. Node 2 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 7.
   <2, (0, 1, 7)>
   
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6. Node 3 does not form any 3-stars.
   
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7. Node 4 does not form any 3-stars.
   
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. Node 5 does not form any 3-stars.
   
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8. Node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 5.
   <6, (0, 3, 5)>
   
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. Node 7 does not form any 3-stars.
   
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. Node 8 does not form any 3-stars.
   
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8. Node 9 does not form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, and <6, (0, 3, 5)>.
