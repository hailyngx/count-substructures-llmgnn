Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. Based on the given edges, nodes 0, 2, and 5 fit this criteria.

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 0: 
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    
- For node 2: 
    - <2, (5, 8, 8)> (Note: Duplicate leave node 8 as it's connected twice to node 2)
    
- For node 5: 
    - <5, (2, 3, 3)>, <5, (3, 2, 2)> (Note: Two unique 3-stars centered at node 5)

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph [4].
