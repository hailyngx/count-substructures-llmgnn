Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first list all the nodes connected to node 0 (center node):
<Node 0, (1, 3, 3)>
<Node 1, (0, 5, 7)>
<Node 3, (0, 6, 7)>

Next, list all the nodes connected to node 2:
<Node 2, (5)>

No other nodes in the graph have exactly 3 connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
