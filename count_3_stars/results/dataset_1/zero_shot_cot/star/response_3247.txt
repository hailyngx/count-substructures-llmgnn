Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes involved in each 3-star by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

For node 0, the nodes connected to it are 1, 3, 5, and 9. It forms 3-stars with the following nodes:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 1, the nodes connected to it are 0, 5, and 8. It forms 3-stars with the following nodes:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>

For node 2, the nodes connected to it are 5 and 7, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 3, the nodes connected to it are 0 and 7, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 5, the nodes connected to it are 0, 1, and 2. It forms a 3-star with the following node:
<5, (0, 1, 2)>

For node 6, the nodes connected to it are 8, but it is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 7, the nodes connected to it are 2 and 3, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

For node 8, the nodes connected to it are 1, 6, and 9. It forms a 3-star with the following node:
<8, (1, 6, 9)>

For node 9, the nodes connected to it are 0 and 8, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Thus, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
