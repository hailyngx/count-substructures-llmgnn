Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the edges incident to each node:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 0), (2, 0), (9, 0)
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (3, 1)
- Node 2: (0, 2), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 7), (7, 2)
- Node 3: (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 9), (9, 3)
- Node 4: (4, 7), (7, 4)
- Node 5: (3, 5)
- Node 7: (2, 7), (4, 7), (7, 2)
- Node 9: (0, 9), (3, 9), (9, 0)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
