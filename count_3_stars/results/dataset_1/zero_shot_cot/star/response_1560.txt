Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
