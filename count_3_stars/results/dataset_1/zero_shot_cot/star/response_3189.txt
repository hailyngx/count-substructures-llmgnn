Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the center node and its adjacent nodes. 

The center node is node 0, and it is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.

Let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
