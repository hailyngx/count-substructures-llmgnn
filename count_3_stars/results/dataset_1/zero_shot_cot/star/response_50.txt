Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph should have degree 3. Let's identify the central nodes in the given graph:

- Node 0 has degree 6
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 4

Thus, the central nodes are 1 and 3. Let's find all the 3-stars centered at nodes 1 and 3:

For node 1:
1. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 3:
3. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 8)>

So, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
