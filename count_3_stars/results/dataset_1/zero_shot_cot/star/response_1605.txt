Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. We will list all unique 3-stars present in the graph and then count them.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
