Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in this graph.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Next, we will find all the 3-stars in this graph. 

We have the following 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 8, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 1)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 8, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].
