Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the nodes that are at the center of any possible 3-star configurations. 
Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with degree 3 in the graph. 
Let's identify those nodes first.

Nodes with degree 3: 
- Node 1 has degree 3.
- Node 3 has degree 4.
- Node 2 has degree 4.
- Node 4 has degree 4.
- Node 5 has degree 2.
- Node 7 has degree 4.
- Node 8 has degree 4.
- Node 9 has degree 6.
- Node 0 has degree 2.

Now, let's construct the possible 3-stars based on the nodes with degree 3 as the center node.

<1, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 9, 3)>

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
