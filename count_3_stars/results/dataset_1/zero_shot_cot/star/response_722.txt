Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the structure of the graph to find the 3-stars.

Given the information, we have 10 nodes with the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected only to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to node 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected only to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.

To find the 3-stars, we need to look for central nodes linked to exactly three leaves.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
