Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we will look for the cases where a node has exactly three neighbors, forming a 3-star structure around it.

Let's list down all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[9]
