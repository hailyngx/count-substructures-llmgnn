Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central nodes with exactly 3 edges are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Let's list the 3-stars with the central node along with its connected nodes.
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 1)>
<8, (3, 6, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 6)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
