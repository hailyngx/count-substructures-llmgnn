Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 0 since we are looking for 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 9

Now, let's list all the 3-stars centered at node 0:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>

There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
