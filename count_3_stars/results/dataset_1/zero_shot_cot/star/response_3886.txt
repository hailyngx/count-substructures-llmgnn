Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Looking at the given edges, we can see the following 3-star configurations:
- Node 1: (6, 7, 3)
- Node 3: (1, 9, 4)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 3)
- Node 6: (1, 4, 5)
- Node 9: (0, 2, 3)

Now, let's count how many 3-stars are there in total. 

Total number of 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the answer is [5]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <1, (6, 7, 3)>, <3, (1, 9, 4)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>.
