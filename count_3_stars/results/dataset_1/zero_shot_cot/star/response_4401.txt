Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central node with degree 3 would create a 3-star. Let's find and count the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0 has degree 3: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8)
   <0, (3, 4, 8)>

2. Node 3 has degree 3: (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4)
   <3, (0, 2, 4)>

3. Node 4 has degree 4: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9)
   <4, (0, 5, 8)>
   <4, (0, 8, 9)>
   <4, (5, 8, 9)>

4. Node 7 has degree 3: (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9)
   <7, (5, 6, 9)>

5. Node 9 has degree 4: (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7)
   <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, and <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
