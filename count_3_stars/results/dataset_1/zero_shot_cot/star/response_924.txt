Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4 (3 connections).
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8 (3 connections).
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 9 (3 connections).
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8 (3 connections).

Step 2: For each of these identified nodes, find the unique 3-stars they form.
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
- There are 4 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
