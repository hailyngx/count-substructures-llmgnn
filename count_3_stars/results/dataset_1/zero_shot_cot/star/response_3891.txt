Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes. Since the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a 3-star, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 9, -)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 9, -)>
<9, (6, 8, -)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
