Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center and three leaves, we need to look for nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 9, -)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, -, -)>
<5, (3, 7, -)>
<6, (8, -, -)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have [9] 3-stars in total.
