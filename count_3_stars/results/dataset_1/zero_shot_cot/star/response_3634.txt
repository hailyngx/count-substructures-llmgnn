Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, -)>
<7, (0, 9, -)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
