Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first look at the connections of each node to identify the 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique combinations above:
[2]
