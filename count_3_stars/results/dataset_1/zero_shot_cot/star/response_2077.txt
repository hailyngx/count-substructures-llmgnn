Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <8, (0, 2, 5)>
5. <9, (4, 5)>
6. <3, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
