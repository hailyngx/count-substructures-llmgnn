Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes.  
Central Node:  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.  
- There are 3 possible 3-stars in this graph:  
<0, (3, 9)>  
<1, (6, 7)>  
<2, (7, 8)>
