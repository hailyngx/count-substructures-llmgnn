Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the center of the 3-star.

In the provided graph:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8. It is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 2, and 3).
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. It is connected to exactly three other nodes (1, 7, and 9).
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4. It is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 2, and 3).

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph:

<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
