Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Starting with Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star with center at Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>

Moving on to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 8. However, we already counted the 3-star with center at Node 0.

Moving on to Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6, but this does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9, but this does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9. We already counted the 3-star with center at Node 0.

Moving on to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. We already counted the 3-star with center at Node 0.

Moving on to Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, but this does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star with center at Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Moving on to Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4, but this does not form a 3-star.

Moving on to Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7. This forms a 3-star with center at Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)> and <7, (1, 4, 9)>.
