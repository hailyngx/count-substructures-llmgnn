Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the nodes that fit this criteria are 4, 3, 6, and 9. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 4: (1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 3), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 4, 0), (2, 4, 3), (3, 4, 1), (3, 4, 2), (4, 1, 9), (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 7), (4, 2, 0), (4, 2, 3), (4, 3, 1), (4, 3, 6), (4, 3, 7), (4, 6, 9), (4, 6, 1), (4, 7, 1)
   <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)> (2 unique 3-stars)

2. For node 3: (3, 5, 9), (3, 4, 5), (4, 3, 5), (4, 3, 9), (5, 3, 4), (5, 3, 9), (9, 3, 5), (9, 3, 4)
   <3, (5, 4, 9)> (1 unique 3-star)

3. For node 6: (6, 4, 9), (6, 9, 8), (9, 6, 8), (9, 6, 4), (4, 6, 9), (4, 6, 1), (8, 6, 9), (8, 6, 4)
   <6, (9, 8, 4)> (1 unique 3-star)

4. For node 9: (9, 1, 3), (9, 3, 4), (9, 3, 5), (9, 3, 6), (9, 3, 8), (1, 9, 3), (1, 9, 4), (3, 9, 1), (3, 9, 4), (3, 9, 5), (3, 9, 6), (3, 9, 8), (4, 9, 3), (4, 9, 1), (5, 9, 3), (6, 9, 3), (6, 9, 8), (8, 9, 6), (8, 9, 3), (8, 9, 4)
   <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)> (3 unique 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
<4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 9)>, <6, (9, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
