Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph by looking for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes:
- There are no 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is: []
