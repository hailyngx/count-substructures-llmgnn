Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Central node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 7)
- Central node 1: (1, 0, 7)
- Central node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 3, 8)
- Central node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 2, 5), (3, 5, 7)
- Central node 4: None
- Central node 5: (5, 3, 6), (5, 6, 9)
- Central node 6: None
- Central node 7: (7, 1, 3), (7, 3, 9)
- Central node 8: None
- Central node 9: None

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 7)>, <2, (0, 3)>, <2, (3, 8)>, <3, (0, 2)>, <3, (2, 5)>, <3, (5, 7)>, <5, (3, 6)>, <5, (6, 9)>, <7, (1, 3)>, <7, (3, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12.]
