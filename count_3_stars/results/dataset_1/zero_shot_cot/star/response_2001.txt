Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The central node of a 3-star needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node in the graph and see if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes.

1. Node 0:
   - Not a 3-star.

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 3)>

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 3, 6)>

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 7)>

5. Node 4:
   - Not a 3-star.

6. Node 5:
   - Not a 3-star.

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (0, 5, 9)>

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <7, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 9)>

9. Node 9:
   - Not a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>.
