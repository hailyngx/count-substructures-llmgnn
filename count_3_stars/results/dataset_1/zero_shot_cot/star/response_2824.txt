Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, -)>
<2, (4, 7, -)>
<3, (4, 9, -)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (6, 9, -)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
