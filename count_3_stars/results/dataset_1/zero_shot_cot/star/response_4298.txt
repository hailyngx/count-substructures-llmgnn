Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

To do this, we can go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star. We'll look for instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes and then list them.

Here are all the 3-stars found in the given graph:

[4]

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (3, 9, -)>
<6, (4, -, -)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>

In total, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
