Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to node 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7.

Hence, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
