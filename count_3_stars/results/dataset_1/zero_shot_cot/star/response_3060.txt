Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center node in a 3-star. 
Nodes with degree 3 will be our center nodes. 

From the given information, the degrees of the nodes are:
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 0
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 4

So, nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9 are potential center nodes as they have a degree of 3.

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars found.
