Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, -)>
<3, (5, 6, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, -)>

Since there are 8 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [8].
