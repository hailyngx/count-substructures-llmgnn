Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Next, let's identify the 3-stars present in this graph:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
