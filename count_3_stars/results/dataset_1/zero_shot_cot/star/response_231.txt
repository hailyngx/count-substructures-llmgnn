Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 2 is the center with leaves 3, 4, and 5. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 3 is the center with leaves 0, 1, and 2. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
3. Node 7 is the center with leaves 5, 6, and 8. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
4. Node 8 is the center with leaves 2, 7, and 9. <8, (2, 7, 9)>
5. Node 9 is the center with leaves 2, 3, and 8. <9, (2, 3, 8)>

So, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
