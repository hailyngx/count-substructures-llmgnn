Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (3, 5)>
