Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 9, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of 10.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
