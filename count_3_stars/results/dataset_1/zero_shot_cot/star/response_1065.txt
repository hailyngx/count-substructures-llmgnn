Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes connected to each node. Then we check which nodes form a 3-star with the central node by having exactly three edges connected to them.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 8.
   - No 3-star centered at node 0.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
   - <1, (3, 6, 8)> (1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8).

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - No 3-star centered at node 2.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8.
   - <3, (1, 2, 7)> (3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7).
   - <3, (1, 7, 8)> (3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8).

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - No 3-star centered at node 4.

6. Node 5 is connected to node 2.
   - No 3-star centered at node 5.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - No 3-star centered at node 6.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   - No 3-star centered at node 7.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
   - <8, (0, 1, 9)> (8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9).
   - <8, (1, 3, 6)> (8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6).
   - <8, (1, 3, 7)> (8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7).
   - <8, (4, 7, 9)> (8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9).

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <<1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>>]
