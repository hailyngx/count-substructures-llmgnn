Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6
- Node 1: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0: 0
- For node 1: 0
- For node 3: 2 (3-star with leaves 0, 4, 6 and 3-star with leaves 4, 7, 9)
- For node 4: 0
- For node 5: 0
- For node 6: 1 (3-star with leaves 0, 3, 7)
- For node 7: 1 (3-star with leaves 1, 3, 9)
- For node 9: 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 2 (from node 3), 1 (from node 6), and 1 (from node 7), totaling to 4 in total.
