Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in 3-star formations. These nodes will have exactly 3 incident edges, meaning they will be either the center or one of the leaves in a 3-star. From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with 3 incident edges as follows:
- Node 1 has incident edges (1, 2), (1, 3), and (1, 5).
- Node 2 has incident edges (1, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 8).
- Node 3 has incident edges (1, 3), (2, 3), and (3, 4).
- Node 4 has incident edges (3, 4), (4, 5), and (4, 6).
- Node 5 has incident edges (1, 5), (4, 5), and (5, 9).
- Node 6 has incident edges (4, 6), (6, 7), and (6, 9).
- Node 9 has incident edges (5, 9), (6, 9), and (9, 4).

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
