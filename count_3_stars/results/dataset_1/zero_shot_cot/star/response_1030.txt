Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star structure. 

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, the 3-star structures can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
