Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.
    - Node 0 has 2 incident edges.
    - Node 1 has 2 incident edges.
    - Node 2 has 3 incident edges.
    - Node 3 has 3 incident edges.
    - Node 4 has 4 incident edges.
    - Node 5 has 3 incident edges.
    - Node 6 has 1 incident edge.
    - Node 7 has 4 incident edges.
    - Node 8 has 4 incident edges.
    - Node 9 has 3 incident edges.
    
Step 2: Find the nodes with 3 incident edges that are connected to each other.
    - Nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8 have 3 incident edges and are connected to each other.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
    - There is only one 3-star in the graph, with nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8 forming the star.
    
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
    
Unique 3-stars: 
    - <2, (3, 7, 8)>
