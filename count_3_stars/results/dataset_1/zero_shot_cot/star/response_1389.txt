Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 since it will be the central node in the 3-star graphs. The nodes connected to node 1 are 8 and 9. 

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1: It is connected to nodes 8 and 9. So, we have two 3-star graphs with node 1 as the center: <1, (8, 9)> and <1, (9, 8)>.
- For node 8: It is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. There is one 3-star graph with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 4, 9)>.
- For node 9: It is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8. We have three 3-star graphs with node 9 as the center: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, and <9, (3, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (8, 9)>, <1, (9, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
