Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6
   
2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 5 and 8
   
3. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7
   
4. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
   
5. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 2 and 8
   
6. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6
   
7. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5
   
8. Node 7:
   - Connected to node 2
   
9. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 unique 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 forms 0 unique 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 2 unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 6)> and <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms 0 unique 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 0 unique 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 1 unique 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 unique 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 7 forms 0 unique 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 0 unique 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, and <6, (0, 2, 5)>.
