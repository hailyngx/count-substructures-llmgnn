Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes and the connected nodes to each central node. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 9, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 1)>
<4, (3, 3, 0)>
<5, (1, 1, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 1)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 0, 0)>
<9, (2, 7, 7)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above to find the final answer:

[10]
