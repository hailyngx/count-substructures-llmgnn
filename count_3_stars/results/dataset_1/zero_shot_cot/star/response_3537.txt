Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star patterns in this graph.

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, -)>
<6, (3, 9, -)>
<8, (1, 2, -)>
<9, (3, 6, -)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[8]
