Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify any 3-stars.

For each node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, we will form a 3-star with that node as the center and the other three nodes as leaves.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 8, NA)> (This 3-star is incomplete as node 3 is only connected to 2 other nodes)

As we cannot form a complete 3-star with node 3 due to the missing connection, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
