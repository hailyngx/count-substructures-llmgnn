Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 9, -)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, -,-)>
<9, (0, 2, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
