Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars:

<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
