Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star by looking for the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5) -> <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9) -> <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7) -> <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 9) -> <6, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
