Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's analyze the given graph step by step:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to node 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 4.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [1]

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
