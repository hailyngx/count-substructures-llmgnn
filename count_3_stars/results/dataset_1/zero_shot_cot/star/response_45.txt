Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

We have 10 nodes with the following edges:
- (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 4), (2, 6), (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 8)

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

[Total number of 3-stars: 0]

Explanation:
The given graph does not contain any 3-stars.
