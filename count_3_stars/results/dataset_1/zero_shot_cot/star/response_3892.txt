Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>.
