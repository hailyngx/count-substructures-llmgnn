Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Given the structure of a 3-star graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges. These nodes will serve as potential center nodes for the 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's find the nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges:
- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6) - degree = 4
- Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5) - degree = 2
- Node 2: (0, 2), (2, 3), (2, 6) - degree = 3
- Node 3: (0, 3), (2, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6) - degree = 4
- Node 4: (0, 4), (1, 4), (4, 6) - degree = 3
- Node 5: (1, 5), (3, 5), (5, 8), (5, 9) - degree = 4
- Node 6: (0, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6) - degree = 5
- Node 7: (7, 8) - degree = 1
- Node 8: (5, 8), (7, 8), (8, 9) - degree = 3
- Node 9: (5, 9), (8, 9) - degree = 2

Nodes 2, 4, and 8 have exactly 3 incident edges, making them potential center nodes for 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars with these nodes as the centers:
1. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
2. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
3. <8, (5, 7, 9)>

Combining all unique 3-stars, we have: <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph: [3].
