Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph by finding nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 

The central nodes are: 
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 6)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 3)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 4)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 7, 8)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
