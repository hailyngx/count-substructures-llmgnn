Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 8
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7
4. Node 3: Connected to node 0, 9
5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 6
6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5
8. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 8
9. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 7
10. Node 9: Connected to node 3

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars.

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
