Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   
    1. The center node 0 does not have 3 connecting nodes, so it is not part of any 3-star.
    2. The center node 1 has 2 connecting nodes (nodes 3 and 9). It is not part of any 3-star.
    3. The center node 2 has 3 connecting nodes (nodes 3, 6, and 8). 
       <2, (3, 6, 8)>
    4. The center node 3 has 3 connecting nodes (nodes 1, 2, and 8). 
       <3, (1, 2, 8)>
    5. The center node 4 has 2 connecting nodes (nodes 0 and 6). It is not part of any 3-star.
    6. The center node 5 does not have 3 connecting nodes, so it is not part of any 3-star.
    7. The center node 6 has 2 connecting nodes (nodes 2 and 4). It is not part of any 3-star.
    8. The center node 8 has 3 connecting nodes (nodes 2, 3, and 9). 
       <8, (2, 3, 9)>
    9. The center node 9 has 3 connecting nodes (nodes 1, 5, and 8). 
       <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]  
Unique 3-stars: <<2, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>]
