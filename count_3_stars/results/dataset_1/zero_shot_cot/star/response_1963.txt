Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
1: 4
2: 3, 4, 7, 8
3: 2, 4, 5, 6
4: 1, 2, 3, 6
5: 3, 6
6: 3, 4, 5, 7
7: 2, 6, 8
8: 2, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Consider each node as the center of a potential 3-star.
- For each center, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star).

<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
