Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting from each node as a potential center, we can look for sets of three nodes that are neighbors to the center node. Let's find and count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Center at Node 0:
   <0, (7, 8, 9)>

2. Center at Node 1:
   <1, (2, 3, 5)>

3. Center at Node 2:
   <2, (1, 5, 6)>

4. Center at Node 3:
   <3, (1, 8, -)>

5. Center at Node 4:
   <4, (5, 6, -)>

6. Center at Node 5:
   <5, (1, 2, 4)>
   
7. Center at Node 6:
   <6, (2, 4, 9)>

8. Center at Node 7:
   <7, (0, -, -)>

9. Center at Node 8:
   <8, (0, 3, 9)>

10. Center at Node 9:
    <9, (0, 5, 6)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
