Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
