Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Start by listing all the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 5, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

2. Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns. A 3-star pattern consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- We can create the following 3-stars from the given graph:
    <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    <2, (3, 7, 9)>
    <3, (2, 5, 9)>
    <5, (0, 3, 4)>
    <7, (2, 5)>
    <9, (0, 2, 3)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-star patterns:
- We have a total of 6 unique 3-star patterns.
