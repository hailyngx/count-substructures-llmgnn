Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars with the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Given edges:
- 0 is connected to 4 and 5
- 1 is connected to 3, 5, and 6
- 2 is connected to 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9
- 3 is connected to 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9
- 4 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7
- 5 is connected to 0, 1, 3, and 8
- 6 is connected to 1, 3, and 4
- 7 is connected to 2, 4, and 8
- 8 is connected to 2, 5, 7, and 9
- 9 is connected to 2, 3, and 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- 3-star with node 2 as the central node: <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- 3-star with node 3 as the central node: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- 3-star with node 4 as the central node: <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- 3-star with node 8 as the central node: <8, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
