Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node (center) and the three leaf nodes connected to it for each 3-star configuration. 

From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-star configurations as follows:

1. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 9)>
3. <3, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <5, (2, 8, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 9, 7)>
6. <7, (0, 3, 4)>
7. <8, (5, 9, 8)>
8. <9, (0, 3, 6)>
9. <9, (8, 5, 6)>
10. <9, (7, 3, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
