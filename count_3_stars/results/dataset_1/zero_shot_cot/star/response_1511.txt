Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which will serve as potential center nodes for 3-stars. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 3, 5)
- Node 2 (connected to 3, 4, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to 0, 1, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 4 (connected to 2, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to 3, 7, 8)
- Node 7 (connected to 6, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9 (connected to 2, 3, 4, 8)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes. 

- Node 0: 1 3-star (<0, (1, 3, 5)>)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (<2, (3, 4, 9)>)
- Node 3: 3 3-stars (<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star (<8, (6, 7, 9)>)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 9)>.
