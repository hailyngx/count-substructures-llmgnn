Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting all possible combinations where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first list the potential 3-stars by identifying the center node and its connected nodes:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, -)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, -)>

Therefore, after listing all potential 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
