Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We can see that the nodes with connections to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
