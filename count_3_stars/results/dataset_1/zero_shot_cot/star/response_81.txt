Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (6, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 6)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 6)>
5. <4, (2, 6, 8)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [6]
