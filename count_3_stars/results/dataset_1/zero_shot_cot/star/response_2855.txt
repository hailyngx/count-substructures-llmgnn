Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's do this step by step.

Step 1: List all nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8

Step 2: Identify 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <7, (4, 6, 0)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [9]
