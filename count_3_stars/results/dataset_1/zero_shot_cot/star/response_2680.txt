Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes that have exactly three incident edges are the potential central nodes for the 3-star graph. 

In this graph, nodes 0, 2, and 8 are the central nodes since they have exactly three incident edges each.

Next, let's find the leaves for each central node:

For central node 0:
- Leaves: 1, 5, 6, 7

For central node 2:
- Leaves: 4, 8, 9

For central node 8:
- Leaves: 5, 7, 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For central node 0, there are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For central node 2, there are 3 possible 3-stars.
- For central node 8, there are 3 possible 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
