Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges. 

From the given edges, the nodes and their corresponding edges are as follows:
- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 9, -)>
<2, (0, 8, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 9, -)>
<7, (0, -, -)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
