Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 1: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 2: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 7: Not a center of any 3-star.
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
