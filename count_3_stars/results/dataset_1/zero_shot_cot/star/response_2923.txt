Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center node possibilities for each potential 3-star. For a 3-star, the center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Looking at the given edges, we see that nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars in this graph: 

<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we have: [5].
