Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center nodes which have 3 outgoing edges.  
From the given edges, the nodes with 3 outgoing edges are: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.

Step 2: For each of these center nodes, find the neighboring nodes connected by edges to form a 3-star. 
- For center node 3: (3, 5, 6), (3, 7, 8), (3, 9, -)
- For center node 4: (4, 1, 5), (4, 6, 8), (4, - , -)
- For center node 6: (6, 0, 4), (6, 3, 5), (6, 7, 8)
- For center node 8: (8, 3, 4), (8, 6, -), (8, - , -)
- For center node 9: (9, 3, 5), (9, - , -), (9, - , -)

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (7, 8, 3)>, <3, (9, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 4)>, <4, (6, 8, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)> [9 stars in total]
