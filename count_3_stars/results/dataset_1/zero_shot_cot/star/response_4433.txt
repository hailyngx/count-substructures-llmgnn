Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Upon examination of the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
