Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

First, let's list down all the nodes and their neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 5)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 8)>
5. <5, (1, 6, 9)>
6. <6, (5, 7)>
7. <7, (6)>
8. <8, (0, 2, 3)>
9. <9, (5)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
