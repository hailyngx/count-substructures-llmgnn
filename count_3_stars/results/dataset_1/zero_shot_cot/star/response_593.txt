Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes connected to each node:

Node 0: 5, 8, 9
Node 1: 5
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 4
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 7
Node 9: 0

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4, forming a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 7, forming 3-stars: <8, (0, 7)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9, forming 3-stars: <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 8, forming 3-stars: <7, (6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
  
Unique 3-stars found: <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 7)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8)>.
