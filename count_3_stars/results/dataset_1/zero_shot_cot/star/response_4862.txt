Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by finding the central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
