Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
3. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 5)>
6. <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
