Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify nodes that are part of 3-stars. Then we can determine the unique 3-stars in the graph.

### Step 1:
Identify nodes that are part of 3-stars by finding nodes with exactly three incident edges. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three incident edges are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

### Step 2:
For each identified potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. These sets of four nodes form 3-stars.

1. For node 0:
   - Connected to 6, 7, 8  
     (0, 6, 7, 8)
     
2. For node 6:
   - Connected to 0, 2, 8
     (6, 0, 2, 8)

3. For node 8:
   - Connected to 0, 3, 5, 6
     (8, 0, 3, 5)

So, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
