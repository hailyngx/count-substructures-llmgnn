Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly 3 edges.
Possible central nodes are: 0, 5, 8, 9

Step 2: For each central node, identify the connected nodes to form a 3-star.
For central node 0:
(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) form a 3-star. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
(6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5) form a 3-star. <6, (0, 3, 5)>

For central node 5:
(5, 1), (5, 9), (5, 3) form a 3-star. <5, (1, 9, 3)>
(5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8) form a 3-star. <5, (3, 6, 8)>
(5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9) form a 3-star. <5, (6, 8, 9)>
(5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 8) form a 3-star. <5, (9, 1, 8)>
(5, 8), (5, 6), (5, 9) form a 3-star. <5, (8, 6, 9)>

For central node 8:
(8, 0), (8, 6), (8, 7) form a 3-star. <8, (0, 6, 7)>
(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7) form a 3-star. <8, (5, 6, 7)>
(8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 5) form a 3-star. <8, (9, 0, 5)>
(8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 5) form a 3-star. <8, (7, 0, 5)>
(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 7) form a 3-star. <8, (6, 5, 7)>

For central node 9:
(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4) form a 3-star. <9, (0, 1, 4)>
(9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8) form a 3-star. <9, (1, 5, 8)>
(9, 2), (9, 0), (9, 5) form a 3-star. <9, (2, 0, 5)>
(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8) form a 3-star. <9, (4, 5, 8)>
(9, 5), (9, 1), (9, 8) form a 3-star. <9, (5, 1, 8)>
(9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 5) form a 3-star. <9, (8, 0, 5)>

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
<[0, (6, 7, 8)], [6, (0, 3, 5)], [5, (1, 9, 3)], [5, (3, 6, 8)], [5, (6, 8, 9)], [5, (9, 1, 8)], [5, (8, 6, 9)], [8, (0, 6, 7)], [8, (5, 6, 7)], [8, (9, 0, 5)], [8, (7, 0, 5)], [8, (6, 5, 7)], [9, (0, 1, 4)], [9, (1, 5, 8)], [9, (2, 0, 5)], [9, (4, 5, 8)], [9, (5, 1, 8)], [9, (8, 0, 5)]>

Step 4: Count the number of 3-stars.
