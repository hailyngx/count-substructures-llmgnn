Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it, forming a 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph and count them.

The nodes with exactly three edges are:
- Node 1 with edges (1, 2) (1, 5)
- Node 2 with edges (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6)
- Node 4 with edges (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7)
- Node 7 with edges (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9)
- Node 8 with edges (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 9)

So, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
