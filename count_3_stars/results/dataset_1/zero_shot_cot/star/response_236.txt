Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. These nodes can be the center of a 3-star. The nodes in this graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 3, 5, and 9.

Next, let's list all the possible 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 0)>
<9, (8, 0, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
