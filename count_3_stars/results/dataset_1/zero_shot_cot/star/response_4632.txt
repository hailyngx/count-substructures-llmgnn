Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 0, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 1)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 1)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
