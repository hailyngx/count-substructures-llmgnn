Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 6, 1)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (9, 2, 6)>
- <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 3)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 1)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (9, 2, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
