Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
    Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
    
Step 2: For each node identified in Step 1, check if it forms a 3-star.
    For node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 7, 4), (1, 8, 4), (1, 2, 7), (1, 2, 8), (1, 7, 8)
    For node 2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 1, 7), (2, 1, 8), (2, 3, 7), (2, 8, 3), (2, 8, 1)
    For node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 1, 9), (4, 7, 9)
    For node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 1, 8), (7, 3, 2), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 9), (7, 2, 8)
    For node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 2), (8, 1, 9), (8, 6, 9), (8, 6, 2), (8, 6, 1)
    For node 9: (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 8), (9, 5, 8), (9, 5, 4), (9, 5, 8), (9, 8, 6)
    
Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
    <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    <1, (2, 4, 8)>
    <2, (1, 4, 7)>
    <2, (1, 4, 8)>
    <4, (1, 7, 9)>
    <7, (1, 4, 8)>
    <8, (1, 4, 9)>
    <9, (4, 7, 8)>
    
Final Answer: [8]
