Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

By examining the edges provided, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9. Node 1 forms two 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 6)> and <1, (3, 6, 9)>.

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>.

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7. Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, and <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>.
