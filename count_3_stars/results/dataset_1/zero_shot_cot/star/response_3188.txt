Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them since those can be potential central nodes for 3-stars. 
From the given information, the nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 1, 2, 5, 8, and 7.

Now, let's identify the three-leaved stars with each of these nodes as the center:
- With node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- With node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 4, 5)> and <2, (5, 8, 1)>
- With node 5 as the center: <5, (2, 4, 8)> and <5, (8, 2, 4)>
- With node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 2, 5)> and <8, (2, 5, 1)>
- With node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
