Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly 3 connections. Each of these nodes will be the center of a 3-star. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 1 has 3 connections: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8).
   - 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 8)>

2. Node 3 has 4 connections: (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8).
   - 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>

3. Node 6 also has 4 connections: (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7).
   - 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>

4. Node 7 has 4 connections: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9).
   - 3-star: <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

<1, (2, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>
