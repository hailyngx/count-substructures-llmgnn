Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
