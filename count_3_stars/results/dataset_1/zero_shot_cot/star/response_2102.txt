Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.

Node 0: 2, 8
Node 1: 3, 4
Node 2: 0, 8
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 7
Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 3, 4, 5
Node 7: 4, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 2, 7
Node 9: 3, 5

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.

[5]

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars.

<0, (2, 8, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
