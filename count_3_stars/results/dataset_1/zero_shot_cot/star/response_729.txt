Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are adjacent to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 4, 6

Next, let's find all possible 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <5, (1, 7, 2)>
7. <6, (4, 9, 0)>
8. <7, (5, 2, 1)>
9. <8, (0, 4, 3)>
10. <9, (4, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
