Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

- Central Node 0: Leaves 1, 6, 8
- Central Node 1: Leaves 0, 6, 8
- Central Node 2: Leaves 6, 7, 8
- Central Node 3: Leaves 6, 7, 9
- Central Node 5: Leaves 8, 9
- Central Node 6: Leaves 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Central Node 7: Leaves 2, 3, 9
- Central Node 8: Leaves 0, 1, 2, 5, 6
- Central Node 9: Leaves 2, 3, 5, 7

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>

There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
