Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) by edges. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 7 has edges to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9, making it a potential center for 3-stars.

2. Examine the neighbors of potential center nodes:
   - For Node 7: (1, 6, 9) forms a 3-star, so we have one 3-star centered at Node 7. <7, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <7, (1, 6, 9)>.
