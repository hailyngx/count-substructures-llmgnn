Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. These will be the nodes with exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes.  

According to the given edges, the nodes with 3 edges are:
- Node 1
- Node 8
- Node 9

Step 2: For each central node found in Step 1, list the nodes they are connected to. These will form the 3-stars.

For Node 1:
- (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4): <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- (1, 9): <1, (9, 9, 9)>

For Node 8:
- (8, 0): <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- (8, 3): <8, (3, 1, 9)>
- (8, 9): <8, (9, 1, 8)>

For Node 9:
- (9, 1): <9, (1, 1, 1)>
- (9, 6): <9, (6, 6, 6)>
- (9, 8): <9, (8, 1, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (9, 9, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>
<8, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 1, 1)>
<9, (6, 6, 6)>
<9, (8, 1, 6)>

[There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the output is [8].]
