Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Let's list down all the 3-star configurations based on the provided graph:

<0, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (0, 5, 3)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars found, and that is [3].
