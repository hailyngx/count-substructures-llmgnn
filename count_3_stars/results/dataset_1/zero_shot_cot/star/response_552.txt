Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (7, 8, 4)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 9)>
3. <2, (7, 5, -)>
4. <3, (1, 9, -)>
5. <4, (1, 8, 9)>
6. <5, (6, 7, -)>
7. <6, (5, -, -)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 5)>
9. <8, (0, 4, -)>
10. <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-star graphs in the given graph.
