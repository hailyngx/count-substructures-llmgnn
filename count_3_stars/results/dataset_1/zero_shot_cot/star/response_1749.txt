Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.

2. Count the number of 3-stars using the identified nodes:
   - We can form 3-stars using the following unique combinations:
     1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
     2. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
     3. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
     4. <4, (2, 6, 7)>
     5. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
     6. <6, (1, 3, 4)>
     7. <8, (5, 6, 9)>
     8. <9, (3, 8, 9)>

3. Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars found: [8]

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
