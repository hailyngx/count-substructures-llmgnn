Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes will be the nodes with exactly three incident edges. Based on the given edges, we can determine that nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 are the central nodes because they each have exactly three incident edges.

Now, let's look for 3-stars in the graph:
- For central node 1: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- For central node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- For central node 4: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- For central node 5: <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- For central node 8: <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Combining all the unique 3-stars found, we get:
[<1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>]
