Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it only has one edge to node 4.
2. Node 1 is not part of any 3-star as it has three edges to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
3. Node 2 is part of a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9. <2, (3, 5, 9)>
4. Node 3 is part of a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
5. Node 4 is part of a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
6. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star as it has four edges to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7.
7. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it has two edges to nodes 3 and 9.
8. Node 7 is not part of any 3-star as it has three edges to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
9. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star as it has two edges to nodes 1 and 9.
10. Node 9 is part of a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6. <9, (2, 4, 6)>

In total, there are 3 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
