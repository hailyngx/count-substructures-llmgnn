Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three incident edges since each 3-star has one central node. 

In this given graph, the nodes with exactly three incident edges are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We will look for each possible central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph (with central nodes and connected leaves):
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 8, 4)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
