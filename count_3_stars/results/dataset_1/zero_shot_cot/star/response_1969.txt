Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Central Node: 0, Leaves: 4, 5, 9
2. Central Node: 1, Leaves: 2, 6, 7
3. Central Node: 2, Leaves: 1, 3, 4
4. Central Node: 3, Leaves: 2, 4, 5
5. Central Node: 4, Leaves: 0, 2, 3
6. Central Node: 5, Leaves: 0, 2, 3
7. Central Node: 6, Leaves: 1, 4, 7
8. Central Node: 7, Leaves: 1, 2, 3
9. Central Node: 8, Leaves: 1, 5, 9

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as: 
<0, (4, 5, 9)> 
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
