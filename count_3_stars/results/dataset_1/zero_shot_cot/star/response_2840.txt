Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
