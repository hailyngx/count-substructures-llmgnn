Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
