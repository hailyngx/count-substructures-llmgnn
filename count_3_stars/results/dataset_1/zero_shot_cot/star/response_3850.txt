Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one to find all the 3-stars:

- Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 5. No 3-stars connected to Node 0.
- Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Possible 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, and <1, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 2 connects to nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Possible 3-stars: <2, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 3 connects to nodes 4, 5, and 8. No 3-stars connected to Node 3.
- Node 4 connects to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9. No 3-stars connected to Node 4.
- Node 5 connects to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Possible 3-stars: <5, (0,1,6)>, <5, (1,2,6)>, <5, (1,3,6)>, and <5, (1,4,6)>.
- Node 6 connects to nodes 1, 2, and 5. No 3-stars connected to Node 6.
- Node 7 connects to nodes 1, 2, and 9. No 3-stars connected to Node 7.
- Node 8 connects to nodes 1, 2, and 3. No 3-stars connected to Node 8.
- Node 9 connects to nodes 2, 4, and 7. No 3-stars connected to Node 9.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, and <5, (0, 1, 6)>.
