Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

1. For node 0, there are two edges: (0, 6) and (0, 8). Node 0 is not a part of any 3-star since it's not connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For node 1, there are four edges: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), and (1, 9). Node 1 is the center of the 3-star <1, (3, 5, 6)>. 

3. For node 2, there are two edges: (2, 7) and (2, 9). Node 2 is not a part of any 3-star since it's not connected to exactly three other nodes.

4. For node 3, there are two edges: (3, 1) and (3, 9). Node 3 is not a part of any 3-star since it's not connected to exactly three other nodes.

5. For node 4, there are two edges: (4, 5) and (4, 6). Node 4 is not a part of any 3-star since it's not connected to exactly three other nodes.

6. For node 5, there are four edges: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 9), and (5, 6). Node 5 is the center of the 3-star <5, (1, 4, 6)>.

7. For node 6, there are four edges: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), and (6, 5). Node 6 is the center of two 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 5)> and <6, (4, 5, 1)>.

8. For node 7, there is only one edge (7, 2). Node 7 is not a part of any 3-star since it's not connected to exactly three other nodes.

9. For node 8, there is only one edge (8, 0). Node 8 is not a part of any 3-star since it's not connected to exactly three other nodes.

10. For node 9, there are five edges: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), and (9, 6). Node 9 is the center of the 3-star <9, (1, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.
