Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them below:

<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>

By listing the unique 3-stars found, we can see that there are 5 three-star structures in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
