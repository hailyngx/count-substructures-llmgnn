Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 1, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8)>
- <3, (5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3)>
- <6, (1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [8] 3-stars.
