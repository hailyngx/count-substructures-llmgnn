Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
```
0 -- 1 -- 2
|         |
9         3
          |
          4
          |
          5
```

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. Let's list them out:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 4)>
<9, (0)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
