Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes: 2, 5, 6, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (2, 5, and 6), we have a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>.

2. Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 6, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 6, and 9), we have another 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (0, 6, 9)>.

3. Node 5 is connected to 5 nodes: 0, 1, 3, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 1, and 9), we have a 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (0, 1, 9)>.

4. Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 2, and 7. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 2, and 7), we have another 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (0, 2, 7)>.

5. Node 9 is connected to 5 nodes: 0, 2, 5, and 7. Since it is connected to exactly three nodes (0, 2, and 7), we have a 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>.
