Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in 3-star configurations. Since each 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to 2, 3, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to 1, 6, 7)
- Node 4 (connected to 6, 7)
- Node 8 (connected to 1, 9)
- Node 9 (connected to 6, 8)

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph using these nodes. 

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph. 

<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, _)>
<8, (1, 9, _)>
  
[4]
