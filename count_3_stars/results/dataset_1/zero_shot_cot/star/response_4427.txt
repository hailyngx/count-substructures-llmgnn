Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node of each potential 3-star in the graph. To be a 3-star, the central node must have exactly three neighbors. The nodes with three neighbors in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.

Next, let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
