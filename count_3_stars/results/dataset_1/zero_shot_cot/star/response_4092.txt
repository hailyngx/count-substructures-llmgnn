Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observations:
- From the given list of edges, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 have degree 4, which means they each have exactly 4 edges incident to them.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and a neighbor we haven't identified yet.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and a neighbor we haven't identified yet.

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
