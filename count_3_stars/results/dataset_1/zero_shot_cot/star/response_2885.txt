Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Central node: 6
  Leaves: 1, 3, 5
  <6, (1, 3, 5)>

- Central node: 4
  Leaves: 0, 7, 9
  <4, (0, 7, 9)>

- Central node: 9
  Leaves: 3, 4, 5
  <9, (3, 4, 5)>
