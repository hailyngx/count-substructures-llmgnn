Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9: <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 2: <1, (5, 7, 2)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, and 6: <9, (3, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
