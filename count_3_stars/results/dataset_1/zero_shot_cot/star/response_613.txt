Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
