Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have degree 3 and are connected to each other. Let's start by identifying such nodes and then determining the unique 3-stars formed by these nodes.

Given the graph, the nodes with degree 3 are: node 0, node 5, and node 7.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
