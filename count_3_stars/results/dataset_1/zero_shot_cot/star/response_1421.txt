Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

Starting from node 0:  
- 3-star with center 0: <0, (1, 5)>  
- 3-star with center 1: <1, (0, 3, 8)>  

Moving to node 2:
- 3-star with center 2: <2, (4, 5, 8)>  

Moving to node 3:
- 3-star with center 3: <3, (1, 4)>  

Moving to node 4:
- 3-star with center 4: <4, (2, 3, 8)>  
- 3-star with center 5: <5, (0, 2, 6)>  

Moving to node 6:
- 3-star with center 6: <6, (4, 5, 7)>  

Moving to node 7:
- 3-star with center 7: <7, (5, 6)>  

Moving to node 8:
- 3-star with center 8: <8, (1, 2, 4, 5)>  

Moving to node 9:
- 3-star with center 9: <9, (4, 5)>  

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The final answer is [9].
