Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These sets will represent the 3-star graphs in the graph.

Let's find the 3-star graphs step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. Since it is only connected to two nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

2. Node 1 is connected to node 4. Since it is only connected to one node, it cannot form a 3-star.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 9)>.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 7)>.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 7. This forms two 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 3)> and <4, (2, 3, 7)>.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. Since it is only connected to two nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

7. Node 6 is connected to node 3. Since it is only connected to one node, it cannot form a 3-star.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. This forms three 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, and <7, (4, 5, 8)>.

9. Node 8 is connected to node 7. Since it is only connected to one node, it cannot form a 3-star.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

Therefore, we have the following 3-star graphs:
<2, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

By counting the unique 3-stars, we get [8].
