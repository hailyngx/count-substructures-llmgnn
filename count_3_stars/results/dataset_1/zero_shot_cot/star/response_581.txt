Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 

- Node 0 has neighbors 3, 4, and 8, forming a 3-star with center at node 0 and leaves at nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 has neighbors 2 and 5, but this does not form a 3-star since there are only two neighbors.
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 3, and 4, forming a 3-star with center at node 2 and leaves at nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 2, and 6, forming a 3-star with center at node 3 and leaves at nodes 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 2, and 5, forming a 3-star with center at node 4 and leaves at nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 4, and 6, forming a 3-star with center at node 5 and leaves at nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 has neighbors 3 and 5, but this does not form a 3-star since there are only two neighbors.
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 3, and 5, forming a 3-star with center at node 7 and leaves at nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 8 has neighbors 0 and 3, but this does not form a 3-star since there are only two neighbors.
- Node 9 has neighbor 3, but this does not form a 3-star since there are only two neighbors.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [6] 3-stars present.
