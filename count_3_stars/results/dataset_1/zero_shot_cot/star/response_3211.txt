Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

We can start by looking at each node in the graph and checking if it is part of a 3-star structure. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to it, we need to check if a node has exactly three neighbors.

Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

- Node 0 has neighbors {2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}, which forms a 3-star <0, (2, 4, 5)>.
- Node 1 has neighbors {4, 7}, which doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 6, 7}, which forms a 3-star <2, (0, 6, 7)>.
- Node 3 has neighbors {6, 8}, which doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 1}, which doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 6, 8}, which forms a 3-star <5, (0, 6, 8)>.
- Node 6 has neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which forms two 3-stars <6, (0, 2, 3)> and <6, (0, 5, 7)>.
- Node 7 has neighbors {1, 2, 6}, which doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors {0, 3, 5}, which doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has neighbors {0, 6}, which doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, and <6, (0, 5, 7)>.

Count of 3-stars: [5]
