Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

First, let's list all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, since those are the potential center nodes of 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 5, 6)
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes (4, 7)
- Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 3, 5)
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 3)

Now, let's enumerate the 3-star graphs using the identified center nodes:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-star graphs, we have a total of [3].
