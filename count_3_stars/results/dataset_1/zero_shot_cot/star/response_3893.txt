Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 1, 9
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7

2. Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: (2, 4, 6), (3, 4, 6), (4, 6, 8), (6, 8, 1)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 8), (2, 1, 8), (1, 8, 3)
- Node 8: (1, 5, 6), (3, 1, 6), (1, 6, 8)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 1)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (2, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 3)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 1, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
