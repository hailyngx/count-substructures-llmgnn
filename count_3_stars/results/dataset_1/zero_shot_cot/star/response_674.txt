Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars that exist. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Identify the central node of each potential 3-star by looking for nodes with exactly three edges.
2. For each central node, identify the three nodes connected to it.

Let's go ahead and find the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Central nodes with exactly three edges:
   - Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)
   - Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8)
   - Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9)
   - Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)
   - Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4)

2. Possible 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <2, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <4, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <9, (0, 3, 4)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars. 

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [10].
