Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Observing the provided edges, we find the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, N/A)> (*)
<7, (4, 6, N/A)> (*)
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

(*) Nodes 6 and 7 are connected to each other, forming a separate pair instead of a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

In brackets, the total number of 3-stars is provided as [8].
