Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Based on the definition of a 3-star, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Looking at the given edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 8, 8)>
<2, (3, 9, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
