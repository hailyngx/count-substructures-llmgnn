Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph by finding all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 9: <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
