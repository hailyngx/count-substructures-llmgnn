Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the graph based on the given edge information:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to node 5.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 8), (1, 5), (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 8), (0, 1), (0, 5)>
<2, (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2)>
<3, (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 0)>
<4, (3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 1)>
<5, (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 9)>
<6, (5, 9), (5, 7), (5, 1)>
<8, (0, 1), (0, 9), (0, 2)>
<9, (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  

<0, (1, 8), (1, 5), (1, 9)>, <1, (0, 8), (0, 1), (0, 5)>, <2, (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2)>, <3, (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 0)>, <4, (3, 5), (3, 2), (3, 1)>, <5, (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 9)>, <6, (5, 9), (5, 7), (5, 1)>, <8, (0, 1), (0, 9), (0, 2)>, <9, (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 8)>
