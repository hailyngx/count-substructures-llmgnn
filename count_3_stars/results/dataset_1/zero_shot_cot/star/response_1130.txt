Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
