Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star. 

Here, a 3-star is formed by the center node and exactly three other nodes connected to the center node. 

Let's first find the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star: 
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 5. (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5)
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6. (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6)
- Node 3 has edges to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6. (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6)
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 9. (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9)
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9. (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 9)
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 5. (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5)
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 2 and 9. (8, 2), (8, 9)
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 4, 5, and 8. (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we have a total of [8] 3-stars.
