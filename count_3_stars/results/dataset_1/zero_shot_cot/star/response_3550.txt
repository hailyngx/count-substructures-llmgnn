Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes of possible 3-stars are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 since each of these nodes has exactly 3 connections. Now let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)> and <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- From node 2: <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 4, 6)> and <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 5, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- From node 9: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: 7. Therefore, the answer is [7].
