Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes: 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 1 node: 8.
- Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes: 4 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to 1 node: 5.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 5, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes: 3, 4, 9, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes: 2 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to 2 nodes: 0 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes: 1 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 5, 8, and 8.

Based on the connections, the only node that is connected to exactly three other nodes is node 5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in the given graph:

\[<5, (3, 4, 9)>\]

So, the final answer is [1].
