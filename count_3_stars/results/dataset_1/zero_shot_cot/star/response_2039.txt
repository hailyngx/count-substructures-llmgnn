Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 7)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 9, 6)>
5. Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 8)> and <6, (1, 7, 9)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 1)>

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
