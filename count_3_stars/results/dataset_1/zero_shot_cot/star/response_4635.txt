Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 9), (0, 2, 1), (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 7), (0, 3, 1), (0, 3, 2), (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 9), (0, 4, 1), (0, 7, 1), (0, 9, 3)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 7), (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 0), (1, 3, 2), (1, 7, 0)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 7), (2, 1, 0), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 0), (2, 3, 1), (2, 7, 0)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 6), (3, 0, 7), (3, 0, 9), (3, 1, 0), (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 7), (3, 2, 0), (3, 2, 1), (3, 6, 0), (3, 7, 0), (3, 9, 0)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 6), (4, 5, 0), (4, 6, 0)
6. Node 5: (5, 4, 0), (5, 8, 0)
7. Node 6: (6, 3, 4), (6, 3, 7), (6, 3, 8), (6, 3, 9), (6, 4, 0), (6, 7, 3), (6, 8, 3), (6, 9, 3)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 3), (7, 0, 6), (7, 1, 0), (7, 1, 2), (7, 1, 3), (7, 2, 0), (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 0), (7, 3, 1), (7, 6, 0)
9. Node 8: (8, 5, 0), (8, 6, 3)
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 6), (9, 3, 0), (9, 6, 0)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>.
