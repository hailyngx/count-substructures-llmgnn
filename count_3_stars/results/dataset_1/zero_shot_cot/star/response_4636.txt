Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, as this will help us find the 3-stars around node 0. The nodes connected to node 0 are 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Since we are looking for 3-stars, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes from the nodes connected to node 0. 

The combinations are: (4, 6, 8), (4, 6, 9), (4, 8, 9), and (6, 8, 9).

Let's check each combination to see if it forms a 3-star:

- For (4, 6, 8):
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
    <0, (4, 6, 8)>
    
- For (4, 6, 9):
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
    <0, (4, 6, 9)>
    
- For (4, 8, 9):
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
    <0, (4, 8, 9)>
    
- For (6, 8, 9):
    - Node 0 is not connected to node 6, 8, or 9. This combination does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph formed around node 0 is [3].

All the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, and <0, (4, 8, 9)>.
