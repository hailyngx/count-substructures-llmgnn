Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are directly connected to each node. 

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
