Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to see if there are any 3-star structures involving node 0 as the central node:
1. Nodes connected to node 0: 6, 9

Since there are two nodes connected to node 0, we can form 2 different 3-stars with node 0 as the center:
1. <0, (6, 9)>
2. <0, (9, 6)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 to see if there are any 3-star structures involving node 1 as the central node:
1. Nodes connected to node 1: 2, 4, 5, 9

Since there are four nodes connected to node 1, we can form 4 different 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
1. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 9)>
4. <1, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (6, 9)>, <0, (9, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, and <1, (4, 5, 9)>.
