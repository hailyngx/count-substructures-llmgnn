Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 3)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (0, 5, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
