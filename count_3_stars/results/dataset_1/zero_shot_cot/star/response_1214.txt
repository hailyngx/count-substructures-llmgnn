Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, since node 0 has the highest degree in the graph (degree 4). 
The nodes connected to node 0 are: 1, 6, 7, and 9.

Next, we will check each node that is connected to node 0 to see if they form a 3-star with node 0. The format of a 3-star is (center, leaf1, leaf2, leaf3).
Let's list them: 
- Node 1: (0, 1, 7, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 6, 8)
- Node 7: (0, 7, 1)
- Node 9: (0, 9, 4, 2)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph: [4]. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8)>
<0, (7, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
