Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, 8: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 7: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 8: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 7: <3, (2, 4, 7)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, 9: <5, (2, 7, 9)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 3: <7, (0, 1, 3)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 9: <8, (0, 2, 9)>
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 8: <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [8]
