Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
  
  - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
  - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
  - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
  - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
  - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
  
Step 2: For each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, consider it as the center of a 3-star and list the nodes connected to it.

- Node 1: (3, 5, 6), (3, 6, 9), (5, 6, 9)
- Node 3: (1, 4, 9)
- Node 4: (0, 3, 6)
- Node 5: (1, 7, 8)
- Node 6: (1, 2, 4)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 3)

Step 3: Combine all unique 3-stars and count the total number of unique 3-stars.

<1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>
