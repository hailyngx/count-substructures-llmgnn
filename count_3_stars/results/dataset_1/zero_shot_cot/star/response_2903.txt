Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-star at node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- 3-star at node 4: <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- 3-star at node 9: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
