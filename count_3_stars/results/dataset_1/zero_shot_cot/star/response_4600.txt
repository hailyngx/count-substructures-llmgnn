Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Center node: 0  
    Leaves: 3, 5, 8 (total 1)

2. Center node: 1  
    Leaves: 5, 7 (total 1)

3. Center node: 3  
    Leaves: 0, 4, 9 (total 1)

4. Center node: 4  
    Leaves: 3, 6 (total 1)

5. Center node: 5  
    Leaves: 0, 1 (total 1)

6. Center node: 6  
    Leaves: 4, 7, 8 (total 1)

7. Center node: 7  
    Leaves: 1, 6, 8, 9 (total 1)

8. Center node: 8  
    Leaves: 0, 6, 7 (total 1)

9. Center node: 9  
    Leaves: 3, 7 (total 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 7)>
