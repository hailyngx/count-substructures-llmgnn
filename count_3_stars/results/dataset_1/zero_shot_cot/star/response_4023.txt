Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the list of edges, we can identify the following 3-star structures:
1. <0, (1, 9, X)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 6, X)>
5. <5, (6, 9, X)>
6. <6, (2, 3, 5)>
7. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
