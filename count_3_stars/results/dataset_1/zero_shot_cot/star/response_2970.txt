Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the nodes that satisfy this condition: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and has an edge to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and has an edge to node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and has an edge to node 4.

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[3]

<0, (1, 2, 1)>
<3, (6, 7, 6)>
<5, (4, 9, 4)>
