Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the graph and find all such 3-stars.

First, let's list all the nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
