Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-stars with central nodes being {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}. 

So, total number of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>
