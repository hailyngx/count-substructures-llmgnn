Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given graph:

Total nodes = 10
Total edges = 30

To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - (0, 1, 0)
    - (0, 2, 0)
    - (0, 3, 0)
    - (0, 4, 0)
    - (0, 9, 0)
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>

2. Node 1:
    - (1, 0, 1)
<1, (0, 2, 3)>

3. Node 2:
    - (2, 0, 2)
    - (2, 3, 2)
<2, (0, 3, 0)>

4. Node 3:
    - (3, 0, 3)
    - (3, 2, 3)
    - (3, 4, 3)
    - (3, 7, 3)
    - (3, 8, 3)
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 3)>

5. Node 4:
    - (4, 0, 4)
    - (4, 3, 4)
    - (4, 6, 4)
<4, (0, 3, 6)>

6. Node 5:
    - (5, 6, 5)
    - (5, 9, 5)

7. Node 6:
    - (6, 4, 6)
    - (6, 5, 6)
    - (6, 7, 6)
    - (6, 9, 6)
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7:
    - (7, 3, 7)
    - (7, 6, 7)
    - (7, 8, 7)
<7, (3, 6, 8)>

9. Node 8:
    - (8, 3, 8)
    - (8, 7, 8)

10. Node 9:
    - (9, 0, 9)
    - (9, 5, 9)
    - (9, 6, 9)

From the above analysis, we found that there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 0)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
