Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

So, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
