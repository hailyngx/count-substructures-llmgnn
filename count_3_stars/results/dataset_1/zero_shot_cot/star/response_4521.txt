Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the number of 3-stars by checking each node as a potential center node.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 9).
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors (6, 7).
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (0, 8).
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor (6).
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor (8).
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (6).
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5).
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8).
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 9).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 8).

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars by checking each potential center node with its neighbors to form a 3-star pattern.

- Possible 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 7, 9)>
    <2, (0, 8, 9)>
    <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    <6, (0, 1, 7)>
    <6, (0, 3, 5)>
    <6, (1, 0, 7)>
    <8, (2, 4, 9)>
    <8, (7, 4, 9)>
    <9, (0, 8, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.

- Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (7, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 8, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
