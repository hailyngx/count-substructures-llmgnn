Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star by looking at every node and its connections. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
