Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in the specific pattern described in the definition.

Given the edge list provided, we will now identify all unique 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 9:
   - <0, (3, 5, 9)>

2. Node 1 does not form a 3-star because it has only one edge.

3. Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5:
   - <2, (1, 3, 5)>

4. Node 3 can form three different 3-stars:
   - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <3, (2, 6, 7)>

5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star because it has only one edge.

6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star because it has only two edges.

7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star because it has only two edges.

8. Node 7 does not form a 3-star because it has only one edge.

9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star because it has only one edge.

10. Node 9 can form one 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 8:
    - <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, and <9, (0, 4, 8)>.
