Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 9)>
2. Node 3: <3, (7, 9, -)>
3. Node 4: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
4. Node 9: <9, (1, 3, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
