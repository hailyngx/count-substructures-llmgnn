Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

Given the edges:
- (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6)
- (1, 3) (1, 4)
- (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7)
- (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9)
- (5, 3) (5, 6)
- (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5)
- (7, 3) (7, 8)
- (8, 7)
- (9, 4)

We can see that the central node of a 3-star can be 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, -)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 8, -)>
<8, (7, -, -)>
<9, (4, -, -)>

Count the number of unique 3-stars: [8]
