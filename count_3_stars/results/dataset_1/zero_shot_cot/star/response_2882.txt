Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We can see that there are multiple 3-stars in this graph. To find them, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

In this graph, the nodes with 3 edges connected to them are nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
