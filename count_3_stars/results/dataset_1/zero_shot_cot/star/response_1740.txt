Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Nodes {0, 4, 8} are connected to three nodes each.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check their neighbors to see if they form a 3-star.
- For node 0: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8) forms two 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 3)> and <0, (4, 8, 3)>
- For node 4: (4, 0, 6, 7, 8) forms one 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- For node 8: (8, 0, 2, 4, 5, 6) forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 4)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
Total number of 3-stars = 2 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 8) = 4
