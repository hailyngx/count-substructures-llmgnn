Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars with their central nodes:
<0, (2, 8, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Now let's count how many unique 3-stars are present in the graph: 
[7]
