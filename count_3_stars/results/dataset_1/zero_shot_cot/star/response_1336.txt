Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can list the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <4, (1, 9, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
