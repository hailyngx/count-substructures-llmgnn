Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. To do this, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central nodes with three connected edges are nodes 0, 4, and 8. Let's list the 3-stars they are part of:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>  
<4, (1, 6, 8)>  
<8, (0, 4, 7)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
