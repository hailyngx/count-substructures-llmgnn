Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
4. <6, (0, 7, 9)>
5. <7, (1, 6, 9)>
6. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
