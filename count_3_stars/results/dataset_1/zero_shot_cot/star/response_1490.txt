Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 2, 6)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 1, 9)>

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.]
