Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for the central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list out all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
