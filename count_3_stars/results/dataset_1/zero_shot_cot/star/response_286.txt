Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
