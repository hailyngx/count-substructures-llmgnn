Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 1, 3)>
2. <1, (4, 0, 7)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
6. <6, (8, 9, 1)>
7. <7, (1, 2, 4)>
8. <8, (6, 7, 9)>
9. <9, (1, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
