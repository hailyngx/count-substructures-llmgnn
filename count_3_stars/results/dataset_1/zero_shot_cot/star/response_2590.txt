Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
3. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 8, 9)>
5. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
6. <6, (4, 7, 9)>
7. <9, (2, 4, 6)>
8. <9, (6, 7, 4)>

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in total in the given graph.  
So, the answer is [8].
