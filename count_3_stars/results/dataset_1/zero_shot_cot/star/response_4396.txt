Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is the center with nodes 2, 3, and 5 as leaves. (<0, (2, 3, 5)>)
2. Node 1 is the center with nodes 7 and 9 as leaves. (<1, (7, 9)>)
3. Node 3 is the center with nodes 0 and 2 as leaves. (<3, (0, 2)>)
4. Node 4 is the center with nodes 6 and 7 as leaves. (<4, (6, 7)>)
5. Node 5 is the center with nodes 0 and 6 as leaves. (<5, (0, 6)>)
6. Node 7 is the center with nodes 1, 4, and 5 as leaves. (<7, (1, 4, 5)>)
7. Node 9 is the center with nodes 1 and 5 as leaves. (<9, (1, 5)>)

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 
There are 7 unique 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
