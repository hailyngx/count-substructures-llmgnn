Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to determine the 3-stars in the graph. 

Central nodes:
- Node 0 has adjacent nodes 5, 6, and 9
- Node 2 has adjacent nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 3 has adjacent nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 7 has adjacent nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6
- Node 8 has adjacent nodes 2, 4, and 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For node 0:
- Central node: 0
- 3-stars: <0, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 2:
- Central node: 2
- 3-stars: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
- Central node: 3
- 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 7:
- Central node: 7
- 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>

For node 8:
- Central node: 8
- 3-stars: <8, (2, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>]
