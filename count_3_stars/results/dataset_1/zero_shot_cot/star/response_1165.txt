Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we know that each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Center node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. Thus, <0, (2, 8, 9)>
2. Center node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. However, this does not form a valid 3-star since there are only 2 connected nodes.
3. Center node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6. Thus, <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. Center node 3 is not connected to three other nodes, so it does not form a 3-star.
5. Center node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8. Thus, <4, (2, 3, 8)>
6. Center node 5 is not connected to three other nodes, so it does not form a 3-star.
7. Center node 6 is not connected to three other nodes, so it does not form a 3-star.
8. Center node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9. However, this does not form a valid 3-star since there are only 2 connected nodes.
9. Center node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. Thus, <8, (0, 3, 4)>
10. Center node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7. Thus, <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, and <4, (2, 3, 8)>.
