Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Looking at the nodes and edges provided, we can see that the central node of a 3-star graph must have degree 3. So, we need to find all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them to identify potential central nodes.

Based on the provided edges, the nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

We will now construct each possible 3-star by considering these nodes as potential central nodes and checking which nodes are connected to them.  

Counting the number of 3-stars:
- For central node 0: <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- For central node 1: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- For central node 2: <2, (0, 7, 1)>
- For central node 5: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- For central node 6: <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- For central node 7: <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- For central node 9: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
