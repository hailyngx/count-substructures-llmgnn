Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars we find:
<0, (6, 9)>  
<2, (4, 8, 9)>  
<4, (2, 8, 5)>  
<5, (1, 2, 9)>  
<8, (2, 4, 9)>  
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
