Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this given graph can be identified by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list them step by step:

1. Nodes with 3 edges connected:
- Node 4: (0, 4), (3, 4), (4, 7), (4, 9)
- Node 5: (0, 5), (2, 5), (5, 0)
- Node 9: (1, 9), (4, 9), (6, 9), (9, 8)

2. Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2)>
- <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
