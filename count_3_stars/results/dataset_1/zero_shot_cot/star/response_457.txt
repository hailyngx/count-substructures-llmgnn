Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Starting with node 0, there are no 3-stars connected to it since it has only one edge.

For node 1, the 3-stars connected to it can be represented as:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 2, there are no 3-stars connected to it since it has only two edges.

For node 3, the 3-stars connected to it can be represented as:
<3, (2, 8, -)>

For node 4, there is no 3-star connected to it since it has only two edges.

For node 5, the 3-stars connected to it can be represented as:
<5, (1, 2, 6)>

For node 6, the 3-stars connected to it can be represented as:
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 7, there are no 3-stars connected to it since it has only one edge.

For node 8, the 3-stars connected to it can be represented as:
<8, (0, 3, -)>

For node 9, there is no 3-star connected to it since it has only two edges.

Therefore, we have found a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
