Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
  
2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (0, 7, 8)>

3. Node 2:
   - No 3-star

4. Node 3:
   - No 3-star

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 6, 9)>
  
6. Node 5:
   - <5, (1, 3, 6)>

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
   - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 7, 8)>
   
8. Node 7:
   - No 3-star

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-star

10. Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
