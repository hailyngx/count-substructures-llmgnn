Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: (4, 9)
- Node 1: (2, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 8)
- Node 4: (0, 6)
- Node 6: (4, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] - <0, (4, 9)>, <1, (2, 8)>, <2, (1, 8)>, <4, (0, 6)>, <6, (4, 5)>.
