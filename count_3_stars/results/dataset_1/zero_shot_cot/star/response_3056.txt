Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

The nodes with three edges connected to them are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [7].
