Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify which nodes form 3-stars. Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 3)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 3)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
