Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We can see that a 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Using this information, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
