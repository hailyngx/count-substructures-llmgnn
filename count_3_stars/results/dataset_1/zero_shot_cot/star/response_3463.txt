Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars present. 

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Let's write down the 3-stars we can find in this graph by following the definition of a 3-star graph:

<0, (5, 9)>  
<1, (4, 9)>  
<2, (5, 9)>  
<3, (6, 8)>  
<4, (1, 7, 9)>  
<5, (0, 2, 6, 8, 9)>  
<6, (3, 5, 7)>  
<7, (4, 6)>  
<8, (3, 5, 9)>  
<9, (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8)>  

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (4, 9)>
<2, (5, 9)>
<3, (6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8)>
