Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7)
4. Node 3: (3, 2)
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5)
6. Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9)
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8)
8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 5)
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6)
10. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5)

From the list above, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 form 3-stars. Let's write down the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
