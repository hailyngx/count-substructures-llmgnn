Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each such structure. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 5)>
<6, (0, 9, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
