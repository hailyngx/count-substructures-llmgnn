Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From node 4: (0, 1, 6)
2. From node 7: (2, 5, 9)

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
