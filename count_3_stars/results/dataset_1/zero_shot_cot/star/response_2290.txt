Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
    0 ---- 5
    |      |
    5      9
          / \
         4 - 2
         | \ |
         |   3
         |
         6
         |
         7
         |
         8
```

We need to count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 9, 6)>
<5, (0, 9, 2)>
<6, (4, 9, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, -)>
<9, (4, 5, 2)>

There are **7** unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is **[7]**.
