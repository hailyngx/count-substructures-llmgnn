Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph based on the given edges. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

For the provided graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, let's identify the possible 3-stars: 

- From node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- From node 1: <1, (5, 6, 8)> and <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- From node 2: <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 9, 4)>
- From node 4: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- From node 5: <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- From node 6: <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- From node 7: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- From node 9: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 9, 4)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>
