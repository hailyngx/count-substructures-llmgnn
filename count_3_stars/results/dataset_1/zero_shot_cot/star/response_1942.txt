Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Analyzing the provided edges, we can see that the node connections form the following 3-stars:
- Node 2: (0, 1, 7)
- Node 7: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 8: (3, 5, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[3] 

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
