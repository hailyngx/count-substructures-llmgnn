Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

The central node of a 3-star graph is the center, and it has exactly three other nodes (leaves) connected to it.

Based on the provided edges, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Center node 0: Leaves 5, 6, 9
2. Center node 1: Leaves 4, 7
3. Center node 2: Leaves 8, 9
4. Center node 3: Leaves 5, 7, 9
5. Center node 5: Leaves 0, 3, 7, 8
6. Center node 6: Leaves 0, 8
7. Center node 7: Leaves 1, 3, 5
8. Center node 8: Leaves 2, 5, 6
9. Center node 9: Leaves 0, 2, 3

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7)>
<2, (8, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
