Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will consider each node as a potential center and check if it forms a 3-star.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   - Node 1 and node 5 are connected to other nodes as well.
   - Since node 0 is not connected to exactly three other nodes, we do not have a 3-star centered at node 0.

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8.
   - Nodes 0, 2, and 6 are not connected to only node 1.
   - However, (1, 2, 8) form a 3-star. Let's mark this.

3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - Since there are no other nodes connected to only node 2, we do not have a 3-star centered at node 2.

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to node 5.
   - There are no other nodes connected to only node 3, so no 3-stars around node 3.

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to node 7.
   - There are no other nodes connected to only node 4, so no 3-stars around node 4.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8.
   - Nodes 0 and 3 are not connected to only node 5.
   - However, (5, 3, 7) form a 3-star. Let's mark this.

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - Since there are no other nodes connected to only node 6, we do not have a 3-star centered at node 6.

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
   - Since node 7 is connected to exactly three other nodes, (7, 5, 8) form a 3-star. Let's mark this.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
   - Nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7 are not connected to only node 8.
   - However, (8, 1, 2) form a 3-star centered at node 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 8, 1)>
<5, (3, 7, 5)>
<7, (5, 8, 7)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
