Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph by finding nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has 3 edges connected: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7)
- Node 1 has 5 edges connected: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 edges connected: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5)
- Node 4 has 3 edges connected: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 9)
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected: (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8)
- Node 9 has 2 edges connected: (9, 1), (9, 4)
- Node 3 has 2 edges connected: (3, 1), (3, 8)
- Node 6 has 2 edges connected: (6, 1), (6, 5)
- Node 7 has 1 edge connected: (7, 0)

Next, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 3-stars are formed around central nodes, and each 3-star consists of the central node and 3 other nodes connected to the central node.

The number of 3-stars can be determined by counting the number of unique central nodes and the number of unique set of leaves connected to each central node.

Let's list the 3-stars identified:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>

Finally, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [6].
