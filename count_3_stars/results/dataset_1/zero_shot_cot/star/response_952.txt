Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes:
- For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9)
- For node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8)
- For node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6)
- For node 3: (3, 6)
- For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9)
- For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6)
- For node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8)
- For node 7: (7, 6)
- For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6)
- For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 4)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <8, (0, 1, 6)>
7. <9, (0, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
