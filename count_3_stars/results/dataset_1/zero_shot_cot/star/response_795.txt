Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8: <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
