Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique configurations where one node is the center connected to three other nodes. We can do this by examining each node and its immediate neighbors.

Given the edges provided, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8)  
   <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>

2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 7)  
   <1, (0, 3, 7)>

3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4)  
   <2, (0, 4, 7)>

4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 9)  
   <3, (1, 7, 9)>

5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 6)  
   <4, (0, 2, 6)>

6. Node 5: (5, 8)
  
7. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9)  
   <6, (4, 7, 9)>

8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6)  
   <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>

9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 5)

10. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9.
