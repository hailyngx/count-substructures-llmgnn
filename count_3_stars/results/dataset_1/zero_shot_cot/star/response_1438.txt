Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 1)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 8, 3)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found: [5].
