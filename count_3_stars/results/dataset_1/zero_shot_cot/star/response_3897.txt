Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's find the number of 3-stars.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all such 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
