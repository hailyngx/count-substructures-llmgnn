Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors connected to it. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify such configurations in the graph. 

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 2, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 7, 8

Based on the analysis above, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
