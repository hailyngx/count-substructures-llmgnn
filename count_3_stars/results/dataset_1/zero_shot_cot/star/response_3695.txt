Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes.
- From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have at least one connection.
- Nodes 2 and 9 do not have any connections.
  
Step 2: For each central node, find the adjacent nodes connected to it.
Central node 0:
  - Adjacent nodes: 1, 7

Central node 1:
  - Adjacent nodes: 0, 4, 6

Central node 3:
  - Adjacent nodes: 6, 7

Central node 4:
  - Adjacent nodes: 1, 5, 6

Central node 5:
  - Adjacent nodes: 4, 6

Central node 6:
  - Adjacent nodes: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7

Central node 7:
  - Adjacent nodes: 0, 3, 6, 8

Central node 8:
  - Adjacent nodes: 7

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars based on the adjacent nodes.
- We see that there are 4 unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives [4].
