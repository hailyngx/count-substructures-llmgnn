Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's first list down all possible 3-stars by examining each node as the potential center:  

1. For node 0:  
    It is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
    So, we have one 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 6)>

2. For node 2:
    It is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
    So, we have one more 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 7)>

3. For node 4:
    It is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
    So, we have another 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 9)>

4. For node 5:
    It is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
    So, we have the last 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, by counting the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
