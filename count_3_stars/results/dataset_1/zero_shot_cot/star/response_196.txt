Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the nodes that are directly connected to each node. 

- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 7

2. Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 1)>, <6, (5, 1, 4)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 0, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 1)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 0, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (4, 1, 5)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (7, 5, 6)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [20]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 20.
