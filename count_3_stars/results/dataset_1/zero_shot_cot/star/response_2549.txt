Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. There are no 3-stars with node 2 as the central node, as it is not connected to any other node.
2. There are two 3-stars with node 0 as the central node:
    - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
3. There is one 3-star with node 1 as the central node:
    - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
4. There are no 3-stars with node 3 as the central node, as it is only connected to two other nodes.
5. There is one 3-star with node 4 as the central node:
    - <4, (5, 8, 8)>
6. There is one 3-star with node 5 as the central node:
    - <5, (4, 8, 8)>
7. There is one 3-star with node 6 as the central node:
    - <6, (1, 0, 7)>
8. There are two 3-stars with node 7 as the central node:
    - <7, (0, 3, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 0, 3)>
9. There are two 3-stars with node 8 as the central node:
    - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <8, (0, 9, 7)>
10. There are two 3-stars with node 9 as the central node:
    - <9, (0, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (0, 8, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
