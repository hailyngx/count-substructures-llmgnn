Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star structures. 

1. Start by looking for nodes with exactly 3 edges. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each of these nodes, list the nodes it is connected to. These connected nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars.
3. Check if each combination of the center and its connected nodes forms a valid 3-star structure.

Let's start this step-by-step process:

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0, connected to 1, 8
- Node 1, connected to 0, 8
- Node 3, connected to 5, 6, 7
- Node 4, connected to 2, 8, 9

Now, let's list out the 3-star structures:

<0, (1, 8)>
<1, (0, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
