Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
