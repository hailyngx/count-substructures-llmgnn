Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs present in the given graph:

- The central node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9)
- The central node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9)
- The central node 2 has 1 edge: (2, 3)
- The central node 3 has 2 edges: (3, 2), (3, 5)
- The central node 4 has 4 edges: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 9)
- The central node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9)
- The central node 6 has 2 edges: (6, 0), (6, 8)
- The central node 8 has 1 edge: (8, 6)
- The central node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (3)>, <3, (2, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 8)>, <8, (6)>, <9, (0, 1, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
