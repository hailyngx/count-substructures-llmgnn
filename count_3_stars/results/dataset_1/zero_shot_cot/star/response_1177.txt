Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

Given edges:
- (0, 8)
- (1, 5), (1, 9), (9, 1)
- (3, 5), (5, 3)
- (4, 6), (6, 4)
- (6, 9), (9, 6)
- (8, 0)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (5, 9, 3)>
2. <6, (4, 9, 5)>
3. <9, (1, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (4, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 6, 5)>
