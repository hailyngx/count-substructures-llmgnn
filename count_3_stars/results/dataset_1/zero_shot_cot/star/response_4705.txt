Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the given graph step by step to identify the 3-stars:

1. Nodes connected to node 0: 5, 6
   - 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (5, 6)>

2. Nodes connected to node 1: 7, 9
   - 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (7, 9)>

3. Nodes connected to node 2: 5, 6
   - 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (5, 6)>

4. Nodes connected to node 3: 6, 7
   - 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (6, 7)>

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6)>
<1, (7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6)>
<3, (6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
