Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Start by identifying all nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.

2. Identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes where two of their neighbors are connected to each other through another edge:
- Potential 3-stars: 
  - Node 0: (2, 4, 8)
  - Node 3: (2, 5, 9)
  - Node 8: (7, 9, 0)

3. Calculate the number of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 0)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.]
