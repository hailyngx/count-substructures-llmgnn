Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers for 3-stars. 
From the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0:
  - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- For Node 2:
  - <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- For Node 4:
  - <4, (0, 5, 8)>
- For Node 5:
  - <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- For Node 8:
  - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- For Node 9:
  - <9, (1, 4, 5)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
