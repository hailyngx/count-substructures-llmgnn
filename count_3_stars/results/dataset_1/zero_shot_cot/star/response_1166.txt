Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3. In this case, node 3 is the only node with degree 3. 

Now, let's find the nodes connected to node 3:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 9 are connected to node 3. 

We can see that there are multiple 3-stars in this graph:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
