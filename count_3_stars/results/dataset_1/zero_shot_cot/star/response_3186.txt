Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step. 

First, note that the total number of 3-stars in a graph is equal to the number of nodes with degree 3, since each of these nodes can form a 3-star with its three neighbors connected by edges. 

Based on the given edges, we can determine the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 6

Nodes with degree 3 are 7 and 9. Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
