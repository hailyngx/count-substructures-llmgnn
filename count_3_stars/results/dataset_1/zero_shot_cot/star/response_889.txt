Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 5)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 9)
3. Node 2: (1, 4, 9)
4. Node 3: (0, 9)
5. Node 4: (2, 6, 7)
6. Node 5: (0, 6)
7. Node 6: (4, 5, 7)
8. Node 7: (4, 6)
9. Node 9: (1, 2, 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
