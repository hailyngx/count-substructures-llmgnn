Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star. 

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to 5
- Node 2 is connected to 3, 5, 8
- Node 3 is connected to 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 7, 9
- Node 5 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6 is connected to 5
- Node 7 is connected to 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9 is connected to 0, 3, 4, 7

From the connections listed, we identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 5)>
<5, (3, 2, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 0, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting all identified 3-stars, we get a total of [27] unique 3-stars.
