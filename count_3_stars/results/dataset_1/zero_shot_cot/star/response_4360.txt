Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes, creating a 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three connections (leaves).
   - Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7 have 3 connections each.
   
2. For each of these nodes, check if it forms a 3-star pattern with its neighbors.
   
   For Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.
   
   For Node 2:
   - <2, (0, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.
   
   For Node 4:
   - <4, (0, 6, 8)> is a 3-star.
   
   For Node 6:
   - <6, (2, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.
   
   For Node 7:
   - <7, (1, 2, 5)> is a 3-star.
   
3. Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars identified.
   
   There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [5].
   
List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>
