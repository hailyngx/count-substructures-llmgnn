Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5: <0, (3, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9: <1, (3, 9)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5: <2, (4, 5)>
4. Node 2 forms another 3-star with nodes 8, 9: <2, (8, 9)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8: <4, (2, 8)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9: <5, (7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
