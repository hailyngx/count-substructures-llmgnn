Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (8, 2, 4)>
2. <1, (6, 7, 3)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 0)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
5. <4, (2, 3, 9)>
6. <5, (7, 9, 1)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 2)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
10. <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
