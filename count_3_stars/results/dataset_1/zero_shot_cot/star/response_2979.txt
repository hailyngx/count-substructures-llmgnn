Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can see that nodes {3, 1, 4} form a 3-star with node 3 as the center. 

Next, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

[1] <3, (1, 4, 0)>
