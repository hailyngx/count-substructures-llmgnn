Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Check each node in the graph:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Since node 0 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (4, 5, and 6) in a star configuration, we have one 3-star centered at node 0 <0, (4, 5, 6)>.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. Node 1 is not part of any 3-star.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 7. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8. Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9. Node 4 is not part of any 3-star.
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. Since node 5 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (0, 6, and 7) in a star configuration, we have one more 3-star centered at node 5 <5, (0, 6, 7)>.
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7. Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9. Since node 7 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (2, 6, and 9) in a star configuration, we have one more 3-star centered at node 7 <7, (2, 6, 9)>.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7. Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

2. Calculate the total number of 3-stars found:
    - Total 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>
