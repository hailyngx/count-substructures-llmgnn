Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node and its connections to determine if they form a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 7), (4, 0), (7, 0) - Forms a 3-star with center node 0, and leaves 4, 7. <0, (4, 7)>

2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5), (5, 1) - Forms a 3-star with center node 1, and leaves 4, 5. <1, (4, 5)>

3. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 9), (3, 2), (9, 2) - Does not form a 3-star as there are more than 3 connections.

4. Node 3: (3, 2) - Does not form a 3-star as there are less than 3 connections.

5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 7), (7, 4) - Forms a 3-star with center node 4, and leaves 0, 1, 7. <4, (0, 1, 7)>

6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 9), (9, 5) - Forms a 3-star with center node 5, and leaves 1, 9. <5, (1, 9)>

7. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 4), (4, 7) - Forms a 3-star with center node 7, and leaves 0, 4. <7, (0, 4)>

8. Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 5), (5, 9) - Forms a 3-star with center node 9, and leaves 2, 5. <9, (2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7)>
<1, (4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 9)>
<7, (0, 4)>
<9, (2, 5)>
