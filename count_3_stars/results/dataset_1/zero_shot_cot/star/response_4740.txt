Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify all unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (5, 9, 2)>
2. <1, (9, 0, 3)>
3. <2, (5, 0, 9)>
4. <3, (9, 1, 4)>
5. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 9)>
7. <6, (2, 4, 8)>
8. <7, (9, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
