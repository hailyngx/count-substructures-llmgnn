Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will focus on identifying the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
