Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since each node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes, the central nodes must have degree 3.

From the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 3, 5, and 8.

Next, we will identify the leaves connected to each central node:

- For node 1: (4, 5, 8, 9)
- For node 3: (2, 5, 8)
- For node 5: (1, 2, 3, 8)
- For node 8: (1, 3, 5)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- For node 3: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- For node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- For node 8: <8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
