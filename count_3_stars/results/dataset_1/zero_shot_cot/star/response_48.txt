Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Based on the given edges, we can determine the central nodes.
  
The central nodes in the given graph are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 8, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 5, 1)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 3, 6, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 7)

Next, we can identify the 3-star configurations in the graph based on the central nodes. Let's list each unique 3-star configuration:

<1, (2, 8, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 1)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 7, 7)> 

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
