Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Central nodes have degree 3, meaning they have 3 adjacent nodes. Let's list the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

1. Central Node 0: Adjacent Nodes (5, 6, 8, 9)
2. Central Node 1: Adjacent Nodes (6, 7)
3. Central Node 5: Adjacent Nodes (0, 7)
4. Central Node 6: Adjacent Nodes (0, 1, 7, 9)
5. Central Node 7: Adjacent Nodes (1, 5, 6, 8)
6. Central Node 8: Adjacent Nodes (0, 7, 9)
7. Central Node 9: Adjacent Nodes (0, 6, 8)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by pairing each central node with its adjacent nodes:

Total 3-Stars: [6]

Unique 3-Stars:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
