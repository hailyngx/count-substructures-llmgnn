Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (8, 9, -)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (8, 9, -)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (4, 7, -)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 4)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 3, -)>

So, there are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
