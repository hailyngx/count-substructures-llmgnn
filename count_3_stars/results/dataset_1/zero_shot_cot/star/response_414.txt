Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2)>
<4, (1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4)>
<7, (5)>
<8, (0)>
<9, (5)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
