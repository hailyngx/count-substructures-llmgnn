Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, -)>
<5, (2, 9, -)>

As we can see, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
