Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:
1. Identify the central node in each potential 3-star.
   - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
2. For each central node, identify the nodes connected to it by a single edge.
3. Check if these connected nodes are also connected to each other. If they are, we have a 3-star.

Now, let's go through the steps and find the 3-stars:
1. Central Node: 0
   - Connected nodes: 3, 8, 9
     - Nodes 8 and 9 are not connected to each other, so (0, 3, 8) and (0, 3, 9) are not 3-stars. However, (0, 8, 9) is a 3-star.
     -> <0, (8, 9)>
  
2. Central Node: 1
   - Connected nodes: 2, 9
     - Nodes 2 and 9 are connected, so (1, 2, 9) is a 3-star.
     -> <1, (2, 9)>
  
3. Central Node: 2
   - Connected nodes: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
     - Nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not all connected to each other, so there are no 3-stars here.
     
4. Central Node: 3
   - Connected nodes: 0, 7
     - Nodes 0 and 7 are not connected to each other, so there are no 3-stars here.
     
5. Central Node: 4
   - Connected nodes: 5, 8, 9
     - Nodes 5, 8, and 9 are connected to each other, so (4, 5, 8) and (4, 5, 9) are 3-stars.
     -> <4, (5, 8, 9)>
  
6. Central Node: 5
   - Connected nodes: 4, 9
     - Nodes 4 and 9 are connected, so (5, 4, 9) is a 3-star.
     -> <5, (4, 9)>
  
7. Central Node: 6
   - Connected nodes: 2, 7
     - Nodes 2 and 7 are connected, so (6, 2, 7) is a 3-star.
     -> <6, (2, 7)>
  
8. Central Node: 7
   - Connected nodes: 2, 3, 6, 8
     - Nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8 are not all connected to each other, so there are no 3-stars here.
     
9. Central Node: 8
   - Connected nodes: 0, 2, 4, 7
     - Nodes 0, 4, and 7 are connected to each other, so (8, 0, 4) and (8, 4, 7) are 3-stars.
     -> <8, (0, 4, 7)>
  
10. Central Node: 9
   - Connected nodes: 0, 1, 4, 5, 2
     - Nodes 1, 4, and 5 are connected to each other, so (9, 1, 4) and (9, 4, 5) are 3-stars.
     -> <9, (1, 4, 5)>
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is the number of unique 3-stars found, which is 6.
