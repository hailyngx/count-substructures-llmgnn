Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node to visualize the graph better.

Node 0: 4, 7  
Node 1: 3, 6, 8  
Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6  
Node 3: 1, 2, 8  
Node 4: 0, 2, 8  
Node 5: 2, 6, 9  
Node 6: 1, 2, 5  
Node 7: 0, 8, 9  
Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 7  
Node 9: 5, 7  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 10 nodes in the graph, so each node can be the center of a 3-star.
For each node, we need to count the number of connected pairs of nodes and multiply this by 2 to get the total number of 3-stars with that node as the center.

Let's start counting:

- Node 0: 2 connected pairs (4-0-7, 0-4-2), so 2*2 = 4
   <0, (4, 7, 2)>, <0, (4, 2, 7)>

- Node 1: 3 connected pairs (3-1-8, 1-3-2, 1-6-5), so 3*2 = 6
   <1, (3, 8, 6)>, <1, (3, 2, 5)>, <1, (6, 5, 3)>

- Node 2: 3 connected pairs (3-2-6, 2-3-4, 5-2-6), so 3*2 = 6
   <2, (3, 6, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 3)>

- Node 3: 2 connected pairs (1-3-8, 3-2-4), so 2*2 = 4
   <3, (1, 8, 2)>, <3, (2, 4, 1)>

- Node 4: 2 connected pairs (0-4-8, 4-2-8), so 2*2 = 4
   <4, (0, 8, 2)>, <4, (2, 8, 0)>

- Node 5: 1 connected pair (2-5-6), so 1*2 = 2
   <5, (2, 6, 5)>

- Node 6: 1 connected pair (1-6-2), so 1*2 = 2
   <6, (1, 2, 6)>

- Node 7: 1 connected pair (9-7-8), so 1*2 = 2
   <7, (9, 8, 7)>

- Node 8: 3 connected pairs (1-8-3, 4-8-2, 7-8-9), so 3*2 = 6
   <8, (1, 3, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 8)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>

- Node 9: 1 connected pair (7-9-5), so 1*2 = 2
   <9, (7, 5, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [4 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 2] = [32]
