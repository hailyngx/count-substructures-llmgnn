Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and an additional node.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and an additional node.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 9, and an additional node.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and an additional node.

2. Determine all unique 3-stars based on the identified central nodes:
   - For central node 0: <0, (3, 5, 0)> (1 occurrence)
   - For central node 2: <2, (6, 8, 2)> (1 occurrence)
   - For central node 8: <8, (2, 9, 8)> (1 occurrence)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 2)>, and <8, (2, 9, 8)>.
