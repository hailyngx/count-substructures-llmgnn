Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
The provided graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, X)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, X)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (2, 3, X)>
<8, (0, 3, X)>
<9, (0, X, X)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
