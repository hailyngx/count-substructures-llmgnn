Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes.

By analyzing the edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 3, 4, 7
   - Potential 3-stars from node 0: <0, (1, 4, 7)> and <0, (3, 4, 7)>

2. Node 1 has 3 neighboring nodes: 0, 2, 4
   - Potential 3-star from node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>

3. Node 2 has 1 neighboring node: 1
   - Node 2 cannot form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 has 2 neighboring nodes: 0, 4
   - Potential 3-star from node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)>

5. Node 4 has 4 neighboring nodes: 0, 1, 3, 7
   - Potential 3-stars from node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)> and <4, (0, 1, 7)> and <4, (3, 7, 0)>

6. Nodes 5, 6, 9 do not form 3-stars as they have no common connections with other nodes.

7. Node 7 has 4 neighboring nodes: 0, 3, 4, 8
    - Node 7 cannot form a 3-star.

8. Node 8 has 3 neighboring nodes: 1, 5, 7
    - Potential 3-star from node 8: <8, (1, 5, 7)>

9. Node 9 has 1 neighboring node: 5
    - Node 9 cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 0)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph = [8]
