Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Looking at the provided edges, we can see that there are several 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:

<0, (3, 5)>  
<1, (2, 3, 9)>  
<2, (1, 5, 6)>  
<3, (0, 1, 8)>  
<4, (7)>  
<5, (0, 2, 7)>  
<6, (2)>  
<7, (4, 5, 8)>  
<8, (1, 3, 5, 7)>  
<9, (1, 3, 7)>  

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9].
