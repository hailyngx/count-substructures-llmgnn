Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars we can find in this graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, -)>
<7, (0, 4, -)>

From the listed 3-stars, we can see that there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
