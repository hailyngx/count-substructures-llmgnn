Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
