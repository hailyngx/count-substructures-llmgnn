Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting these unique instances gives us a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
