Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the list of edges and count the number of 3-stars.

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 5, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 5, 9)>

3. Node 3:
   - No 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

4. Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 7)>

5. Node 6:
   - No 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

6. Node 7:
   - No 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

7. Node 8:
   - No 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

8. Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>.
