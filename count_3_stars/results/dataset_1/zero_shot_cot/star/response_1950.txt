Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
   - Node 0: Connected to node 4
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 3: Connected to node 9
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 7, 8, 9
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 8
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 8
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - Start with each node as the central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - Count the number of 3-stars that can be formed from each central node.
   
3. Count of 3-stars for each central node:
   - Node 0: 0
   - Node 1: 0
   - Node 3: 0
   - Node 4: 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>
   - Node 5: 0
   - Node 6: 0
   - Node 7: 0
   - Node 8: 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
   - Node 9: 3-stars: <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 1, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
   - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <4, (1, 8, 9)>
   - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <8, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 8)>
   - <9, (3, 1, 9)>
   - <9, (3, 4, 5)>
