Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4.

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph by finding all possible unique combinations where a node is the central node and the other three nodes are connected to it. 

By observation, we can find the 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
