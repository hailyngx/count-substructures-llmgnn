Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-star as it has 2 edges.
2. Node 1: No 3-star as it has 2 edges.
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star as it has 2 edges.
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 6)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
7. Node 6: No 3-star as it has 2 edges.
8. Node 7: No 3-star as it has 1 edge.
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it has 3 edges.
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it has 3 edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

<2, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>
