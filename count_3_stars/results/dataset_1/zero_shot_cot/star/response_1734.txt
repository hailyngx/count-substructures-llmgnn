Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 7, 7)>
- <2, (3, 3, 3)>
- <3, (2, 2, 2)>
- <4, (0, 0, 0)>
- <5, (0, 0, 0)>
- <6, (7, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <8, (7, 7, 9)>
- <9, (6, 8, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
