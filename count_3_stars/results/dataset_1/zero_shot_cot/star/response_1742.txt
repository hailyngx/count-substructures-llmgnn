Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
    - Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have exactly three edges connected to them.

Step 2: For each identified node, check if it forms a 3-star.
    - Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 8) --> <1, (0, 2, 8)>
    - Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6) --> <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>
    - Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 6) --> Not a 3-star since it does not have three connected nodes.
    - Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 8) --> Not a 3-star since it does not have three connected nodes.
    - Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9) --> <5, (2, 7, 9)>
    - Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9) --> <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>
    - Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9) --> <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>
    - Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) --> <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total unique 3-stars.
    - Total 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>
    
    [Total unique 3-stars: [14]]
