Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that serve as centers of 3-stars and ensure that they have exactly 3 neighbors.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
  
Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5] 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
