Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
  
To find the 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

In this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.

So, there are a total of 6 3-stars in the given graph.
