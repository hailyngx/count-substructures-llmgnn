Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 1)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 0)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
6. <5, (3, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (2, 7, 8)>
8. <7, (6, 5, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 5, -)>
10. <9, (5, -, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
