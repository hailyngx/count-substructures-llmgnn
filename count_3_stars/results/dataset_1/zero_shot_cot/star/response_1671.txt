Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 8, 7)>
- <6, (8, 9, 7)>
- <7, (5, 9, 1)>
- <7, (5, 9, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of 9. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
