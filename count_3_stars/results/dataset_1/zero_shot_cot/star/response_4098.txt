Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph. To do this, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

After identifying the central nodes, we will then check the connected nodes to form the 3-stars. This will help us find all unique 3-stars in the graph.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Central Node: 0
   Connected Nodes: 3, 7

2. Central Node: 1
   Connected Nodes: 3, 5, 6

3. Central Node: 3
   Connected Nodes: 0, 1, 4, 8

4. Central Node: 5
   Connected Nodes: 1, 4, 6

5. Central Node: 6
   Connected Nodes: 1, 5, 9

6. Central Node: 9
   Connected Nodes: 6, 7

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
