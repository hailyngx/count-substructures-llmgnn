Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 2, 6

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 7)> - Central node: 0, Leaves: 6, 7
- <2, (3, 9)> - Central node: 2, Leaves: 3, 9
- <3, (2, 4)> - Central node: 3, Leaves: 2, 4
- <4, (3, 6)> - Central node: 4, Leaves: 3, 6
- <6, (0, 4, 5)> - Central node: 6, Leaves: 0, 4, 5
- <7, (0, 1, 6)> - Central node: 7, Leaves: 0, 1, 6
- <9, (2, 6)> - Central node: 9, Leaves: 2, 6

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
