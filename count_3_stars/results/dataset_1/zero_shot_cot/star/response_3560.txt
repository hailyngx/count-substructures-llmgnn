Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph by checking which nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

Node 3, 7, and 8 are the central nodes as each of them has 3 edges connected to them.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by starting with each central node and identifying the 3-stars connected to them:

For central node 3:
- <3, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 0)>

For central node 7:
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (3, 8, 1)>
- <7, (8, 1, 2)>

For central node 8:
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 1)>
- <8, (7, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].   
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 0)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 1)>, <7, (8, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (7, 1, 9)>.
