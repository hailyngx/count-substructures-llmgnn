Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which helps us identify the potential 3-stars in the graph. Based on the given information, the nodes and their connections are as follows:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3: Connected to node 7.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 5: Connected to node 9.
- Node 6: Connected to node 2.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 7.

We can see that nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes and can be potential centers of 3-stars. Let's find the actual 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>

2. For Node 4:
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>

3. For Node 7:
- <7, (2, 3, 9)>

4. For Node 9:
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
