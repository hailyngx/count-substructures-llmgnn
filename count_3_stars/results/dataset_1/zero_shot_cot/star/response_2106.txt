Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 6, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
