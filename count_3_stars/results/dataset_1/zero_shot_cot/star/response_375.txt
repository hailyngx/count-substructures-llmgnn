Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Observations:
- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 
- If we find a node with exactly three neighbors, we have a potential 3-star centered at that node.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
