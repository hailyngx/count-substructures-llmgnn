Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the central node of a 3-star. 
Since a 3-star requires the central node to be connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we need to find all the nodes in the graph that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 4, 8, and 3)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6)

Next, we can construct 3-stars using each of these nodes as the central node. 

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- From Node 0: <0, (4, 8, 3)>
- From Node 5: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- From Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- From Node 7: <7, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
