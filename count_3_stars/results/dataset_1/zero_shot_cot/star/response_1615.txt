Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After analyzing the provided edge list, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. Central node 0: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 7) - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
2. Central node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5) - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. Central node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4) - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. Central node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7) - <2, (4, 5, 7)>
5. Central node 2: (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 1) - <2, (7, 8, 1)>
6. Central node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8) - <3, (1, 5, 8)>
7. Central node 4: (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6) - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
8. Central node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2) - <5, (0, 1, 2)>
9. Central node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
10. Central node 5: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8) - <5, (4, 7, 8)>
11. Central node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8) - <6, (1, 4, 8)>
12. Central node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5) - <7, (0, 2, 5)>
13. Central node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 2) - <7, (5, 9, 2)>
14. Central node 8: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5) - <8, (2, 3, 5)>
15. Central node 8: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 9) - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
16. Central node 9: (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 8) - <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
