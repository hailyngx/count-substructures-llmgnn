Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
The central nodes in this graph are nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9 since each of these nodes is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: List the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
