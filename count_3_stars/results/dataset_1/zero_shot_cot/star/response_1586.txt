Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <2, (1, 3, 4)>  
2. <3, (2, 6, 7)>  
3. <4, (2, 8, 9)>  
4. <5, (6, 9, 10)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
