Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 8, 0)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 3)>
<5, (2, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
