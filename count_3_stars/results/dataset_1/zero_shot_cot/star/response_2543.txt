Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 7)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 8)>
6. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
7. <8, (0, 1, 5)>
8. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
