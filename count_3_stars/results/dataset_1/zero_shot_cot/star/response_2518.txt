Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes with the following degrees are connected to only three other nodes:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars from these nodes:
- From Node 2: <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- From Node 3: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- From Node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- From Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- From Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 4)>
- From Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
