Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 9), (1, 5, 9), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 0, 1), (3, 2, 9), (3, 5, 6), (3, 6, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 6, 9)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 3), (5, 1, 3)
7. Node 6: (6, 3, 9), (6, 4, 9), (6, 7, 9), (6, 8, 9)
8. Node 7: (7, 1, 9), (7, 6, 9)
9. Node 8: (8, 1, 9), (8, 6, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 1, 3), (9, 1, 0), (9, 2, 3), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 7), (9, 6, 8)

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: 

<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (8, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 9, 2)>, <3, (5, 0, 6)>, <3, (6, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 0, 3)>, <6, (9, 7, 6)>, <8, (1, 9, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
