Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration and then count how many times it occurs.

Let's first list the nodes connected to each node to identify any possible 3-stars:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6)>
- <6, (4, 9)>
- <8, (2, 9)>

Counting the occurrences of each unique 3-star:
- <0, (2, 4)> appears 2 times
- <2, (0, 5, 7)> appears 1 time
- <4, (0, 6)> appears 1 time
- <6, (4, 9)> appears 1 time
- <8, (2, 9)> appears 1 time

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
