Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it. Each such node will form a 3-star centered at that node.

Based on the provided list of edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
