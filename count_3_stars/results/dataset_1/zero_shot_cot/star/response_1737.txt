Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.  
In this graph, nodes 0, 1, and 2 are the central nodes because each of them has three edges connected to them.

Step 2: For each central node, list the three connected nodes to form a 3-star.  
For central node 0: <0, (1, 5, 8)>  
For central node 1: <1, (0, 7, 9)>  
For central node 2: <2, (5, 6, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
