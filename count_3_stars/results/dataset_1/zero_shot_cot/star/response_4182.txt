Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-star subgraphs it contains.

First, let's list all nodes with their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 7
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3

Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we are looking for nodes with degree equal to 3 and their neighbors.

From the given graph, we identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [4].
