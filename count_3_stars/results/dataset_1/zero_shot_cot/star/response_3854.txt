Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (8)>
<5, (1, 2)>
<6, (1, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
