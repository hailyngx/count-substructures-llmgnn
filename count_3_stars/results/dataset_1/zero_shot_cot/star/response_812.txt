Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7) [<0, (1, 3, 6)>]

2. Node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 8), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 8) [<1, (0, 4, 6)>]

3. Node 4: (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 8), (4, 3, 5), (4, 3, 6), (4, 3, 8), (4, 5, 8), (4, 6, 8), (4, 6, 9) [<4, (1, 3, 6)>]

4. Node 5: (5, 4, 7), (5, 4, 8) [<5, (4, 7, 8)>]

5. Node 6: (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 7), (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 7), (6, 2, 4), (6, 7, 4), (6, 7, 9) [<6, (0, 2, 4)>]

6. Node 7: (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 6), (7, 0, 8), (7, 5, 8), (7, 6, 8), (7, 6, 9) [<7, (0, 5, 8)>]

7. Node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 5), (8, 1, 7), (8, 4, 5), (8, 4, 7), (8, 5, 7) [<8, (1, 4, 5)>]

8. Node 9: (9, 4, 7) [<9, (4, 7, 9)>]

9. Node 2: No 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
