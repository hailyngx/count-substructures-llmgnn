Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Central node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8
2. Central node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7
3. Central node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
4. Central node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7
5. Central node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3
6. Central node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9
7. Central node 6: Connected to nodes 2 and 4
8. Central node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9
9. Central node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9
10. Central node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
