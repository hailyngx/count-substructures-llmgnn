Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 9, -)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 9, -)>
5. <4, (1, 7, -)>
6. <5, (2, -, -)>
7. <6, (0, 2, -)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
9. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
