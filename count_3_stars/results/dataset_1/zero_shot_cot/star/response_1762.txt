Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node:

0: 2, 3, 8  
1: 4  
2: 0, 4, 6  
3: 0, 6, 8, 9  
4: 1, 2, 8  
6: 2, 3  
7: 8, 9  
8: 0, 3, 4, 7  
9: 3, 7  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

[3-stars: 2]  
<0, (2, 3, 8)>  
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
