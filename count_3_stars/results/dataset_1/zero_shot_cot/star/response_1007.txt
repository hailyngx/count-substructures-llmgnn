Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all the potential central nodes with exactly three connections to other nodes. Then we can list the 3-stars with these central nodes.

Potential central nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7

3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
