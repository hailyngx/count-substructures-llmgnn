Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes with exactly three connections each. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we identify the nodes connected to each center node to complete the 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 9 have exactly three connections each. Let's now list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Thus, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
