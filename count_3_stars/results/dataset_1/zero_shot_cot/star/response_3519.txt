Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central node will have exactly three edges connected to it. 

The nodes with 3 edges are: 0, 5, 6.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
