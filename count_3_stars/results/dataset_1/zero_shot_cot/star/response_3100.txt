Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list all the 3-stars we find in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 4)>
<1, (6, 0, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
