Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
3. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
4. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
5. <8, (0, 1, 7)>
6. <9, (4, 5, 6)>

[There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
