Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the central nodes as follows:
- Node 0 has 3 edges connected to it: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9)
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it: (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 9)
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it: (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6)

Next, we can list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [3].
