Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 0, 6)>
<6, (9, 5, 0)>
<7, (1, 0, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
