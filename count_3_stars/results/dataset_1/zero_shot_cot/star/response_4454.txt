Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 7)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
5. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
6. <8, (4, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [6]
