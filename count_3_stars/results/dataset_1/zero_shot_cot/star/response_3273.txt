Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

We can find the unique 3-stars in this graph by looking at the relationships between nodes. By looking at the connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:

- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 4)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 7, 5)>
- <5, (2, 7, 0)>
- <5, (2, 7, 3)>
- <7, (0, 5, 2)>
- <7, (0, 5, 4)>
- <7, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 4)>
- <7, (2, 5, 0)>
- <7, (2, 5, 3)>
- <7, (7, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].
