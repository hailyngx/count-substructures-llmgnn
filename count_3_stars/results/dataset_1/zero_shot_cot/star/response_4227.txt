Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible central nodes that could be part of a 3-star are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Checking each central node:
- Node 0: Nodes connected to 0 are 1, 4, 5, 8. These form the following 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)> and <0, (1, 4, 8)>. (Total: 2)
- Node 1: Nodes connected to 1 are 0, 4, 9. These form the following 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 9)>. (Total: 1)
- Node 3: Nodes connected to 3 are 4, 5, 6, 8. These form the following 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 8)> and <3, (4, 6, 8)>. (Total: 2)
- Node 4: Nodes connected to 4 are 0, 1, 2, 3. These form the following 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>. (Total: 1)
- Node 5: Nodes connected to 5 are 0, 3. These form the following 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 6)>. (Total: 1)
- Node 6: Nodes connected to 6 are 3, 9. These form the following 3-star: <6, (3, 8, 9)>. (Total: 1)
- Node 8: Nodes connected to 8 are 0, 3. These form the following 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 4)>. (Total: 1)
- Node 9: Nodes connected to 9 are 1, 6. These form the following 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 3)>. (Total: 1)

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
