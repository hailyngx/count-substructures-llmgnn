Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:  

1. Identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node.  
   - Node 0: 3, 6  
   - Node 1: 7, 9  
   - Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 7, 9  
   - Node 4: 3, 6  
   - Node 5: 3, 9  
   - Node 6: 0, 4  
   - Node 7: 1, 3  
   - Node 8: 9  
   - Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 8  

2. Count the number of 3-stars by examining each node and its neighbors.  
   - For node 0: <0, (3, 6, 4)>  
   - For node 1: No 3-star as a center  
   - For node 3: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>  
   - For node 4: No 3-star as a center  
   - For node 5: No 3-star as a center  
   - For node 6: No 3-star as a center  
   - For node 7: No 3-star as a center  
   - For node 8: No 3-star as a center  
   - For node 9: <9, (1, 8, 3)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  

<0, (3, 6, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 8, 3)>
