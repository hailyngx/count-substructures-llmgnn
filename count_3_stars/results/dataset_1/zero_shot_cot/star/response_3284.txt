Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

Given the edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to node 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
