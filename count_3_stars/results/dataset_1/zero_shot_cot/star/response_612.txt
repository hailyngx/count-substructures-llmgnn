Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

Given edges:
(1, 3) (1, 7)
(2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8)
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7)
(4, 7) (4, 9)
(5, 2) (5, 6)
(6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9)
(7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9)
(8, 2)
(9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Using the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Checking each node:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 3 and 7 (Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 7)
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3 and 5 (Forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 5)
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6 (Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 3)
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4 (Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 7)
- Node 4, 5, 6, 8, 9: Not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2)>
<7, (1, 3)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in this graph.
