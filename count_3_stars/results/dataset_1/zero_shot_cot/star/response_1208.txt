Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the information provided, we can analyze the graph and count the 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6)>
<9, (3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[10]
