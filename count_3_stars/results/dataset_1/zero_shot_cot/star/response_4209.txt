Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8 and 9: <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8: <4, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, and <4, (5, 7, 8)>.
