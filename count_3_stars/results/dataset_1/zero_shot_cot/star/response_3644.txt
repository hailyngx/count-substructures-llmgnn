Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Count the number of 3-stars.
- We already know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
- To find all the 3-stars, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node has three neighbors connected to it.

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
- Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
    - <2, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (2, 6, 9)>
    - <4, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
    - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
- There are 7 unique 3-stars identified in the given graph.
