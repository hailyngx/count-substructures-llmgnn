Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8.

Step 2: Determine the 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 8), 0>
- <1, (4, 9), 1>
- <2, (7), 2>
- <3, (8, 9), 3>
- <4, (1, 7, 8), 4>
- <6, (8, 9), 6>
- <7, (2, 4), 7>
- <8, (0, 3, 4, 6, 9), 8>
- <9, (1, 3, 6, 8), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars: [9]

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
