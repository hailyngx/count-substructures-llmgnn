Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first find the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2.
- Node 4 is connected to node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9. 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[Total number of 3-stars: 3]

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
