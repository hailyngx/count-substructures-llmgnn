Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
