Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars and list them, let's first identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars based on the given information.

Nodes with their respective connections:
- Node 0: Connected to node 5
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1 and 4
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 8 and 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4 and 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 6 and 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 3)>
<2, (1, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (8, 9, 6)>
<7, (4, 8, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
