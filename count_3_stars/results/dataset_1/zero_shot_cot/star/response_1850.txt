Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges and then count them.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 9) -> <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 6) -> <1, (0, 6)>
3. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9) -> <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
4. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9) -> <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
