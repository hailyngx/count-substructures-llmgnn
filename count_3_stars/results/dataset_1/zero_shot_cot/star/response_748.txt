Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the center node and its adjacent nodes. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the center node and its adjacent nodes:
- Center node: 0
- Nodes connected to 0: 1, 4, 8

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by looking at each possible combination of center node and its adjacent nodes:

1. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (4, 9, -)>
7. <6, (4, -, -)>
8. <7, (1, -, -)>
9. <8, (0, 4, -)>
10. <9, (4, 5, -)>

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
