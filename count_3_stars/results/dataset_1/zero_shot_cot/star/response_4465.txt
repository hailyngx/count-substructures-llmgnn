Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
In this graph, the only node connected to exactly three other nodes is node 1.

Step 2: Identify the neighbors of node 1.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Step 3: Check which sets of three neighbors of node 1 form a 3-star pattern.
In this case, the sets of three neighbors that form 3-star patterns are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>

Step 4: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
There are 28 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
