Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3, 4, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to 4, 7, and 3
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, 5, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to 5, 6, and 9

Now, let's count the 3-stars. We can form 3-stars using the identified center nodes and their connected nodes:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 5, 9)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
