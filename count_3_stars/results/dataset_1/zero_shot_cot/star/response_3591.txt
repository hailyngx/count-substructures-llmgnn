Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 2, 4, 5
   <0, (2, 4, 5)>

2. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 0, 3, 4
   <2, (0, 3, 4)>

3. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 0, 2, 5
   <4, (0, 2, 5)>

4. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 2, 5, 6
   <3, (2, 5, 6)>

5. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 3, 4, 8
   <6, (3, 4, 8)>

6. Central node: 7
   Leaves: 0, 9, not connected (isolated node)
   <7, (0, 9)>

There are 6 unique 3-star structures in the given graph, so the count of 3-stars is [6].
