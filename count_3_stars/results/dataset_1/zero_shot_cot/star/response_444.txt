Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has only 3 edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), and (0, 7). Therefore, node 0 cannot form a 3-star.

2. Node 1 has 5 edges: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), and (1, 9). Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7. 

3. Node 2 has 2 edges: (2, 1) and (2, 5). Therefore, node 2 cannot form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 7). Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7.

5. Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7), and (5, 9). Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9. 

6. Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 1), (6, 5), and (6, 7). Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7.

7. Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), and (7, 6). Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5. 

8. Node 8 has 1 edge: (8, 9). Therefore, node 8 cannot form a 3-star.

9. Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8), and (9, 1). Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
