Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Since a 3-star graph has 4 nodes where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we will need to look for such structures in the given graph. Let's start by finding all the possible 3-stars based on the given edges:

1. In this graph, we have:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to node 0
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 7: Connected to node 5
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1 and 4
- Node 9: Connected to node 2

2. We can observe the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 3, _)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>

3. Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 5 different 3-stars.

Therefore, the output is [5].
