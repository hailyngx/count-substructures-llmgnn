Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
The central node is listed first, followed by the leaf nodes.

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <5, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
6. <8, (1, 3, 4)>
7. <9, (0, 1, )>

There are a total of 7 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the answer is [7].
