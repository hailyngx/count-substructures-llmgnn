Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.

There are a few steps to follow to identify the 3-stars:
1. Locate nodes with exactly three incident edges.
2. Check if these nodes form a 3-star.

Let's start:
- Node 0 has 3 incident edges: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8)
- Node 1 has 2 incident edges (not 3).
- Node 2 has 5 incident edges: (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9)
- Node 3 has 1 incident edge (not 3).
- Node 4 has 2 incident edges (not 3).
- Node 5 has 3 incident edges: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 8)
- Node 6 has 2 incident edges (not 3).
- Node 7 has 3 incident edges: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 8)
- Node 8 has 5 incident edges: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 incident edges: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
