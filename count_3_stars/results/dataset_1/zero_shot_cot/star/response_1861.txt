Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the information about the graph:
- We have 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9.
- There are 16 edges connecting these nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, -)>
<5, (4, - , -)>
<6, (0, - , -)>
<8, (2, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 8, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in total.
