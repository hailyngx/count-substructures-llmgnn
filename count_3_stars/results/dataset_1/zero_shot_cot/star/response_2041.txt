Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we identify each 3-star in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
