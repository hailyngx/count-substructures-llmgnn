Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as those nodes have the potential to be the central node of a 3-star. These nodes are: node 0, node 2, node 7, and node 9.

Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of the center node and exactly three leaves connected to the center.

1. For node 0:
- (0,1), (0,2), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)
These connections form the 3-star <0, (1, 2, 6)>.

2. For node 2:
- (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,6), (2,7), (2,9)
These connections form the 3-star <2, (0, 1, 3)> and the 3-star <2, (6, 7, 9)>.

3. For node 7:
- (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,4), (7,9)
These connections form the 3-star <7, (0, 1, 2)> and the 3-star <7, (4, 9, 2)>.

4. For node 9:
- (9,2), (9,7), (9,8)
These connections form the 3-star <9, (2, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (4, 9, 2)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
