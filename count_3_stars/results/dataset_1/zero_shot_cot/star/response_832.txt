Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each central node which is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (9, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
