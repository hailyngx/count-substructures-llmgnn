Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with their neighboring nodes:

Node 0: Neighbors - 2, 7
Node 1: Neighbors - 2, 4, 7
Node 2: Neighbors - 0, 1, 4, 5
Node 3: Neighbors - 6
Node 4: Neighbors - 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 5: Neighbors - 2, 4, 6
Node 6: Neighbors - 3, 5, 9
Node 7: Neighbors - 0, 1, 4, 8
Node 8: Neighbors - 7
Node 9: Neighbors - 4, 6

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 7, 1)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
6. <6, (3, 5, 9)>
7. <7, (4, 1, 8)>
8. <9, (4, 6, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
