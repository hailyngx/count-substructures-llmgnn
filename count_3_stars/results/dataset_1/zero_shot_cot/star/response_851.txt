Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <6, (1, 4, 5)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <7, (1, 4, 6)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, and 4: <8, (3, 9, 4)>
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
