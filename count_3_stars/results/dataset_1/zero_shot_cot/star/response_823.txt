Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three incident edges.
2. For each of these nodes, check if the connected nodes form a 3-star configuration.
3. Count and list the unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Nodes with exactly three incident edges: 
   - Node 0 has 2 incident edges: (0, 2) and (0, 7)
   - Node 2 has 2 incident edges: (2, 0) and (2, 3)
   - Node 3 has 2 incident edges: (3, 2) and (3, 8)
   - Node 5 has 3 incident edges: (5, 1), (5, 6), and (5, 9)
   - Node 6 has 3 incident edges: (6, 5), (6, 7), and (6, 9)

2. Check for 3-star configurations:

   - <0, (2, 7)>
   - <2, (0, 3)>
   - <3, (2, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <6, (5, 7, 9)>

3. List the unique 3-star configurations:

   - <0, (2, 7)>
   - <2, (0, 3)>
   - <3, (2, 8)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
