Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 5

Now, count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- For each node, check if it forms a 3-star.
- A 3-star is formed when a node has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it.

Count of 3-stars: [4]

<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
