Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars in the given graph results in [8].
