Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [5].
