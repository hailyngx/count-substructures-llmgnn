Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. First, let's list all the nodes connected to node 0: {2, 5, 8}.
   
2. Next, let's list all the nodes connected to node 1: {2, 6}.
   
3. Now, let's list all the nodes connected to node 2: {0, 1, 8, 9}.
   
4. For node 4, the connected nodes are: {6, 8, 9}.
   
5. Node 5 is connected to: {0, 8}.
   
6. Node 6 is connected to: {1, 4}.
   
7. Node 8 is connected to: {0, 2, 4, 5}.
   
8. Lastly, node 9 is connected to: {2, 4}.

Now, let's form the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, -)>
<6, (1, 4, -)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
