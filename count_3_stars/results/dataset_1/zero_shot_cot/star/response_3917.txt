Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors):
   - Node 0 is connected to 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   - Node 2 is connected to 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 4.
   - Node 3 is connected to 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - Node 5 is connected to 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 7.
   - Node 6 is connected to 3 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 7.
   - Node 9 is connected to 3 neighbors: nodes 3, 5, and 8.

2. Form the 3-stars with the central nodes and their unique 3 neighbors:
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <3, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <9, (3, 5, 8)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
