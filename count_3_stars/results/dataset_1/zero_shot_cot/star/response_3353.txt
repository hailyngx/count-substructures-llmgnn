Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 3, 6, 7
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 9
Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 9
Node 4: 8
Node 5: 1, 3
Node 6: 0, 8
Node 7: 0, 3, 8
Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 3, 8

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
