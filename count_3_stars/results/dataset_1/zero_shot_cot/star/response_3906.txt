Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars and then count how many unique 3-stars there are. 

First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0: (3, 5, 7)
2. Node 1: (2, 5, 9)
3. Node 2: (1, 8, 9)
4. Node 3: (0, 6, 9)
5. Node 5: (0, 1, 4), (6, 7, 9)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
