Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 are connected to fewer than three nodes, so they can't be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes 6, 8, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes, so they can potentially be the center of a 3-star. We will check for each of these nodes.

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9, forming a 3-star: <6, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7, forming a 3-star: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7, forming a 3-star: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 3 unique 3-stars found: <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>
