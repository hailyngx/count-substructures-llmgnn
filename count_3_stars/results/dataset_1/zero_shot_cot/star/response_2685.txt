Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are directly connected to each node:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
