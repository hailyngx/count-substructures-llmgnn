Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

[<0, (3, 6, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 1)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
