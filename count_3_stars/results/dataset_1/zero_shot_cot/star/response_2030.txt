Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Looking at the given edges, we can list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (3, 4, 9)>
3. <1, (0, 6, 6)>
4. <2, (3, 6, 8)>
5. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
6. <4, (0, 6, 6)>
7. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
8. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
9. <9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
