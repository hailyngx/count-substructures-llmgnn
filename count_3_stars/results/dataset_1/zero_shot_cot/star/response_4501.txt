Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 8)>
3. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
4. <1, (4, 2, 8)>
5. <1, (4, 2, 9)>
6. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <2, (1, 4, 6)>
8. <2, (4, 1, 5)>
9. <2, (4, 1, 6)>
10. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
11. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
12. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
13. <6, (0, 2, 7)>
14. <9, (1, 3, 7)>

There are 14 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [14].
