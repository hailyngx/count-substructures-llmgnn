Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes can act as centers of the 3-stars. These nodes should have exactly three neighbors.

Let's identify the nodes that have three neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 9, and no other.
- Node 3 has neighbors 6, 9, and no other.
- Node 6 has neighbors 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbors 6, 7, and no other.
- Node 9 has neighbors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

The nodes that can act as centers of the 3-stars are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these potential center nodes:

For node 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- [1]

For node 2:
- <2, (1, 9, x)>
- [2]

For node 3:
- <3, (6, 9, x)>
- [3]

For node 6:
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- [6]

For node 7:
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- [7]

For node 8:
- <8, (6, 7, x)>
- [8]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
