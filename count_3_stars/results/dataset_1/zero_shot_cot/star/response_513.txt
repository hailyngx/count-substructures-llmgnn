Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 2)>
2. <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
6. <6, (5, 8, 9)>
7. <7, (1, 3, 9)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 6)>
9. <9, (1, 4, 6)>
