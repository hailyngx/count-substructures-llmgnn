Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7) -> <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9) -> <1, (6, 8, 9)>
3. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6) -> <2, (3, 5, 6)>
4. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 8) -> <3, (2, 7, 8)>
5. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 8) -> <4, (5, 8)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4) -> <5, (0, 2, 4)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9) -> <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8) -> <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (6, 8)>
9. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9) -> <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8) -> <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
