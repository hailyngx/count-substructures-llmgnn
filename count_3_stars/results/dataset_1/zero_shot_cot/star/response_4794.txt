Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the central node of a 3-star will have three adjacent nodes connected to it. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, -)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
