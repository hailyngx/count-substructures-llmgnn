Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 6. (<2, (0, 1, 6)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9. (<6, (1, 2, 9)>)

Count of unique 3-stars in the graph: [2]
