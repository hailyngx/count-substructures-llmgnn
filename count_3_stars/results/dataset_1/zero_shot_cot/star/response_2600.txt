Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- From node 1: <1, (2, 4, 0)>
- From node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- From node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- From node 6: <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- From node 9: <9, (0, 6, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
