Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to node 6 since it is the only node with degree 5.  
Step 2: For each node connected to node 6, check if it forms a 3-star.  
Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  

Following these steps, the 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<6, (0, 1, 2)>  
<6, (5, 8, 9)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
