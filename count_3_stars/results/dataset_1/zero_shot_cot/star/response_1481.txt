Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, we observe that for a 3-star to exist, the center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 1)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
