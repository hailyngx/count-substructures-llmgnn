Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star with center node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. 3-star with center node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
3. 3-star with center node 2: <2, (0, 8, 9)>
4. 3-star with center node 9: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
