Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. For a 3-star graph, the central node will have exactly 3 neighbors.

The central nodes in this graph are:  
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9)  
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 5, 7)  
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
