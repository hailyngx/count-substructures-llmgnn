Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the degree of each node
- Node 0: degree = 2
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 1
- Node 4: degree = 3
- Node 5: degree = 1
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 6

Step 2: Identify the 3-star structures
- Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Step 4: Count the number of 3-stars [5]
