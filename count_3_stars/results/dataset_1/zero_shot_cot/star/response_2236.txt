Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three incident edges. Let's list them:

- Node 0 has 4 incident edges.
- Node 2 has 4 incident edges.
- Node 6 has 4 incident edges.
- Node 9 has 3 incident edges.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the nodes found above:

<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there is only 1 unique 3-star in the given graph. So the final answer is [1].
