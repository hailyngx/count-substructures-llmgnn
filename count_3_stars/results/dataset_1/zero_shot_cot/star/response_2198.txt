Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, node 1, and node 9 since these nodes are potential centers of the 3-stars.  

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:  

- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 1)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 6)>  

There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
