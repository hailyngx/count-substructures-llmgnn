Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star in this graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph: 

[9]
