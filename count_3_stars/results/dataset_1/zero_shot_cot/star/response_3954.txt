Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars. 

Given edges: (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 0), (2, 6), (3, 7), (5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 8)

The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
