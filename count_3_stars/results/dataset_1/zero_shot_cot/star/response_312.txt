Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify which nodes can act as the centers of a 3-star. 
Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3 in the graph. 
From the given edges, we can determine the degrees of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 5

Nodes 1, 3, 6 can act as the centers of a 3-star.

Now, let's find the 3-stars with the identified central nodes:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
