Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in each 3-star pattern:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 4.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.

Next, we will count the number of 3-star patterns:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (5, 9)>
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (0, 9)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
