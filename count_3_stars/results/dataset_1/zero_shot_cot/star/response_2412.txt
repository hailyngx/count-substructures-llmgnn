Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 1)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 1, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
