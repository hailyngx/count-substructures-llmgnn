Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

The 3-stars in the given graph can be listed as follows:

<1, (3, 7, 2)>
<2, (3, 8, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 1)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 9, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (2, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 1)>
<7, (3, 1, 2)>
<7, (3, 2, 1)>
<7, (6, 5, 4)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 3, 7)>
<8, (7, 2, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<10, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
