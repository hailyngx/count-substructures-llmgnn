Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible combinations of 3 nodes where one is the center and the other two are leaves connected to the center.

We will consider each node as the center in turn and identify the adjacent nodes to check if they form a 3-star pattern. 

Let's begin by listing the 3-star patterns in the graph:
<0, (3, 1, 6)>
<1, (3, 0, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-star patterns: [8].
