Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (5, 9), 1>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 0)>
<4, (2, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 2)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
