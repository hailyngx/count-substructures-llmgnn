Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided edges, here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, -)>
<4, (1, 8, -)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, -)>
<7, (1, 8, -)>
<9, (1, 3, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find there are [8] of them.
