Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (5, 6, X)>
<2, (9, 3, X)>
<3, (9, X, X)>
<4, (6, 8, X)>
<5, (1, 6, X)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, X)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
