Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph step by step.

1. Starting with node 1:
    - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 2)>

2. Moving to node 2:
    - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <2, (6, 7, 1)>

3. Node 3:
    - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <3, (4, 8, 1)>

4. Node 4:
    - <4, (2, 3, 1)>
    - <4, (3, 1, 2)>

5. Node 5:
    - No 3-star centered at node 5.

6. Node 6:
    - <6, (1, 2, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 9, 1)>

7. Moving to node 7:
    - <7, (2, 9, 6)>
    - <7, (9, 6, 2)>

8. Node 8:
    - No 3-star centered at node 8.

9. Node 9:
    - <9, (6, 7, 2)>
    - <9, (7, 2, 6)>

Thus, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [16]. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 1)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 1)>, <4, (2, 3, 1)>, <4, (3, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 1)>, <7, (2, 9, 6)>, <7, (9, 6, 2)>, <9, (6, 7, 2)>, <9, (7, 2, 6)>.
