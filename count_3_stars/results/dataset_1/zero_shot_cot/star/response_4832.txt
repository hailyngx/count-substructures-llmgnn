Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 8, -)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, -, -)>
<3, (1, 5, -)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
