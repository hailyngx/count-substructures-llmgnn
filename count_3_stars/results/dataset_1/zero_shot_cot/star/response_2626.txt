Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
5. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 6, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
8. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 8)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
