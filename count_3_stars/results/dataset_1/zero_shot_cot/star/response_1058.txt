Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star subgraphs:
1. <2, (0, 3, 5)>
2. <2, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 8)>
4. <2, (0, 6, 8)>
5. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
6. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
7. <2, (3, 6, 8)>
8. <2, (5, 6, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [8].
