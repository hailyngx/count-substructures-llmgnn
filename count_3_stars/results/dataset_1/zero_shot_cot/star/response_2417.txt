Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars that exist in the graph based on the definition provided.

Given the information provided, the 3-star patterns in the graph can be counted as follows:

1. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (3)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <5, (3, 6)>
5. <6, (5, 7, 9)>
6. <7, (3, 6)>
7. <8, (0, 3)>
8. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
