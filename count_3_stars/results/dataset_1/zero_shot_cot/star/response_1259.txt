Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes that have exactly three neighbors. From the given edges, the nodes with three neighbors are 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9.

Let's now list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
