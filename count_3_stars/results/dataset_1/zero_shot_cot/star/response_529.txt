Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, as these can potentially be the center of a 3-star. In the given graph, nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9 satisfy this criterion.

2. For each of these candidate center nodes, identify the 3-star configurations they are part of:
   - For node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 9)
   - For node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 4), (3, 0, 9)
   - For node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 3), (4, 0, 9)
   - For node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 4), (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 7), (9, 0, 8)

3. Combine all unique 3-star configurations found:
   <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
