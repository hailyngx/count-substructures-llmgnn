Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to node 3, as node 3 will be the center of each 3-star in this graph:

1. Nodes connected to node 3: {0, 2, 5}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph using node 3 as the center:

1. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
4. <3, (5, 0, 7)>
5. <3, (5, 0, 7)>
6. <3, (5, 0, 7)>
7. <3, (2, 4, 8)>
8. <3, (2, 4, 8)>
9. <3, (2, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (5, 0, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>
