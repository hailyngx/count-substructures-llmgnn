Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Here are the steps to identify and count the 3-stars:

1. **Identify Nodes with exactly 3 Neighbors:**
    - Node 0 has neighbors 1, 5, and 8.
    - Node 2 has neighbors 4 and 7.
    - Node 7 has neighbors 2 and 8.
    - Node 8 has neighbors 0 and 7.

2. **Determine 3-Stars:**
    - Based on the above analysis, we can see that the 3-star structures in the given graph are:
        - <0, (1, 5, 8)>
        - <2, (4, 7, -)>
        - <7, (2, 8, -)>
        - <8, (0, 7, -)>

3. **Count the Number of 3-Stars:**
    - As we have identified 4 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
    
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, -)>
<7, (2, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 7, -)>
