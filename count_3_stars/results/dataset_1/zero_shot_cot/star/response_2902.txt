Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 6)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
8. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
