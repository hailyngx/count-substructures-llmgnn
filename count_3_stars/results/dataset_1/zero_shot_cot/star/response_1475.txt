Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.<br>
Let's go through the nodes one by one and find the 3-stars that have that node as the center:

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
  
For node 1:
- <1, (3, 5, -)>

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
  
For node 3:
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
  
For node 4:
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
  
For node 5:
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
  
For node 6:
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
  
For node 7:
- <7, (6, 9, -)>
  
For node 8:
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
  
For node 9:
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
  
Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [15] 3-stars.
