Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star. 

The central node and its adjacent nodes are as follows: 
- Central Node 1: Nodes 3 and 6
- Central Node 2: Nodes 3, 4, and 9
- Central Node 3: Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Central Node 4: Nodes 2 and 3
- Central Node 5: Nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9
- Central Node 6: Nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Central Node 7: Nodes 5 and 9
- Central Node 8: Nodes 5 and 6
- Central Node 9: Nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 6), (2, 4, 9), (2, 5, 9), (4, 2, 3), (5, 3, 7), (5, 7, 9), (5, 8, 9), (7, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3)>
<5, (3, 7, 8), (3, 8, 5), (5, 7, 9), (7, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8), (3, 1, 6), (5, 8, 6)>
<7, (5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 5), (2, 5, 9), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 9), (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 9), (4, 2, 3), (5, 3, 7), (5, 7, 9), (7, 5, 9)>
