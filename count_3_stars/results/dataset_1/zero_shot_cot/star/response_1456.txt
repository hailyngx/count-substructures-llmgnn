Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that form 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can identify the potential central nodes of the 3-stars. The central nodes will have exactly three incident edges. Let's find those nodes first:

- Node 0 has 2 incident edges
- Node 1 has 2 incident edges
- Node 2 has 5 incident edges
- Node 3 has 5 incident edges
- Node 4 has 3 incident edges
- Node 5 has 1 incident edge
- Node 6 has 3 incident edges
- Node 7 has 3 incident edges
- Node 8 has 5 incident edges
- Node 9 has 3 incident edges

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 6)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 3, 8)>
6. <6, (3, 8, 9)>
7. <7, (0, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (2, 8, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 4, 9)>
10. <8, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
