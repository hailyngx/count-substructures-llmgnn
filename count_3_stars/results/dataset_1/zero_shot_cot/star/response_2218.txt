Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (6, 3, 7)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final answer is [10].
