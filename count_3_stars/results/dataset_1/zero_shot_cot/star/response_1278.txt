Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's enumerate the 3-stars:

<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.  
There are 7 unique 3-stars in total.
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
