Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (3, 9, _)> (Note: only two leaves are connected to node 0)
2. 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
3. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
4. 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 6, 7)>
5. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (2, 7, 9)>
6. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 7, _)>
7. 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>
8. 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (1, 2, 3)>
9. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
