Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three incident edges. Based on the given edges, the central nodes are 0, 4, 7, and 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0: <0, (2, 9)>
2. Central node 4: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Central node 7: <7, (4, 9)>
4. Central node 9: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. 

The final answer is [4].
