Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes involved in 3-stars. 

Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, we construct the 3-stars based on the given edges:
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <7, (6, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
