Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Checking each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7 but not to any other nodes. So, (0, 2, 6, 7) forms a 3-star. 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 9 but not to any other nodes. So, (1, 5, 9) forms a 3-star. 
- Node 2 is connected to node 0 only. 
- Node 3 is connected to node 9 only. 
- Node 4 is connected to node 8 only. 
- Node 5 is connected to node 1 only. 
- Node 6 is connected to node 0 only. 
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. 
- Node 8 is connected to node 4 only. 
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7. 

Hence, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 9)>
