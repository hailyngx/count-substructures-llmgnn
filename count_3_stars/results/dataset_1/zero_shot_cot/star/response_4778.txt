Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
3. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
5. <8, (0, 6, 9)>
6. <9, (7, 8, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
