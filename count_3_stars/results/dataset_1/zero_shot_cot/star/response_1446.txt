Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we start by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

From the provided edge list, we can identify the following central nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4 (and nodes 6 and 8, but those connections are not relevant for 3-stars).

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
