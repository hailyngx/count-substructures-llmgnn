Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 7, 9.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 9.

2. For each node identified, check if the other connected nodes form a 3-star pattern:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 0, and 9: <6, (7, 0, 9)>
- Node 8 forms two 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 7)> and <8, (1, 2, 7)>
  
3. Count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
