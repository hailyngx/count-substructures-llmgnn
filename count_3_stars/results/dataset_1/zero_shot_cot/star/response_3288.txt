Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 6)>
<2, (1, 9, 6)>
<3, (0)>
<4, (6, 7)>
<5, (6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6, 8)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[10]
