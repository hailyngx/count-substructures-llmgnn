Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[4]

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
