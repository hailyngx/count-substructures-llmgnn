Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9. It forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 1 and 9 as leaves: <0, (1, 9)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 8. However, out of these, only the connection with node 0 forms a 3-star. So, we already counted this 3-star in the previous step and we don't need to count it again.
3. Node 3 is connected to node 1, but it doesn't form a 3-star as it lacks the required number of edges.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6. This does not form a 3-star as it lacks the required number of edges.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. It forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center and nodes 7 and 9 as leaves: <5, (7, 9)>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7. Out of these, the connection with node 1 forms a 3-star. However, we already counted this 3-star earlier.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. It forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 5 and 9 as leaves: <7, (5, 9)>.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 1. This connection did not form a 3-star as it lacked the required number of edges.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8. However, we already counted the 3-stars with nodes 0, 5, and 7 earlier. So, we do not count any additional 3-stars here.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 9)>
<5, (7, 9)>
