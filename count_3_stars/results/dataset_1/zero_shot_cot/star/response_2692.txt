Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
