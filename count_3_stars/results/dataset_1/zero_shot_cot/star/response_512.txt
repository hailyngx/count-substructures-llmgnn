Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars. 

First, let's list each node and the nodes it is connected to:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2, 3
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3

Now, let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not part of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 7)> <- This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 0, 7, and 5.
4. Node 3: <3, (6, 8, 9)> <- This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 5: Not part of any 3-star.
6. Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 5)> <- This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 1, 3, and 5.
7. Node 7: Not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
9. Node 9: <9, (1, 2, 3)> <- This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are: 
<2, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
