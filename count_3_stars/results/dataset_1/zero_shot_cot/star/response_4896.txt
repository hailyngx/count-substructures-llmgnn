Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
8. Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 5)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.  

Therefore, the answer is [7].
