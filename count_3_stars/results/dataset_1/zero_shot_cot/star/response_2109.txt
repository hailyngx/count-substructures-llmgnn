Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
We can start by identifying the nodes that, together with the center node, form a 3-star structure. In this case, we are looking for nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

By analyzing the edges given, we can find the following 3-stars:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, X)>

The last 3-star <9, (2, 5, X)> has a missing leaf node "X" attached to node 9. However, since there is no other node connected to node 9 in the given edge list, we cannot form a complete 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
