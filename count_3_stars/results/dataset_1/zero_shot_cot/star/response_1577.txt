Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars that exist. 

Let's first find the central nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. So, node 0 is a central node with 5 leaves connected to it.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 4, 6, and 9. So, node 5 is a central node with 3 leaves connected to it.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9. So, node 6 is a central node with 4 leaves connected to it.
- Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 do not meet the criteria of being the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (6, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, we get a total of [5].
