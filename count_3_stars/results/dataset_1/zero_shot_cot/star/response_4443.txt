Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. There are no 3-stars in this graph since there are no nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
