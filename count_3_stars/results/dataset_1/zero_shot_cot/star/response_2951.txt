Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- There are 6 possible central nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Counting the number of 3-stars for each central node:
  - Central node 0: 1 (0, 4, 5), 1 (0, 4, 9) [Total: 2]
  - Central node 1: 1 (1, 4, 8) [Total: 1]
  - Central node 2: None
  - Central node 4: 1 (4, 6, 8) [Total: 1]
  - Central node 6: 1 (6, 4, 8) [Total: 1]
  - Central node 8: 1 (8, 4, 9) [Total: 1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 0)>, <0, (4, 9, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 1)>, <4, (6, 8, 4)>, <6, (8, 4, 6)>.
