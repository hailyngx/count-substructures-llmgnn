Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify 3-stars
- Start by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 edges: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8

Step 2: Determine 3-star configurations
- For each node with 3 edges, check if the connected nodes form a 3-star configuration with the central node.

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, -)>  (Missing one edge)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars
- Count the total number of unique 3-stars found in Step 2.

Total unique 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
