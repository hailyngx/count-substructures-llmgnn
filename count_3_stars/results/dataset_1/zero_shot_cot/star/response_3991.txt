Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first find all possible 3-stars. 
Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 3, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 9, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the number of unique 3-stars:
[7]
