Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's list out all the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {3, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 5}

2. Now, we identify the 3-stars in the graph. We look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 has three neighbors: 2, 5, and 7. So, <1, (2, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.
- Node 5 has three neighbors: 1, 2, and 6. So, <5, (1, 2, 6)> is a 3-star.

3. The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
