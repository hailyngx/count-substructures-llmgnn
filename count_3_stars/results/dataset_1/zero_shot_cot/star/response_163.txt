Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Let's list the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:
- Central node 0 is adjacent to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7.
- Central node 2 is adjacent to nodes 0 and 7.
- Central node 3 is adjacent to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Central node 5 is adjacent to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
- Central node 7 is adjacent to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Central node 8 is adjacent to nodes 3 and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Central node 0 forms 3-stars with leaves (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 7), (2, 5, 7), and (3, 5, 7). (4 in total)
- Central node 2 forms 3-stars with leaves (0, 3, 7) and (0, 5, 7). (2 in total)
- Central node 3 forms 3-stars with leaves (0, 5, 8). (1 in total)
- Central node 5 forms 3-stars with leaves (0, 3, 7). (1 in total)
- Central node 7 forms 3-stars with leaves (0, 2, 5) and (0, 5, 8). (2 in total)
- Central node 8 forms 3-stars with leaves (3, 7, 0). (1 in total)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (3, 7, 0)>
