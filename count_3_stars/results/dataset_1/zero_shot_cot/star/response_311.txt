Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star present. 

Given edges:
(0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
(1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) 
(2, 0) (2, 3) 
(3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) 
(4, 1) 
(5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) 
(6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) 
(7, 5) 
(8, 0) 
(9, 0) (9, 5)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
