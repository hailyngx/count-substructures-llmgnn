Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- Node 2, Node 7, and Node 8 are connected to Node 0.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Counting the 3-stars with Node 0 as the central node:
    - <0, (2, 7, 8)>

2. Counting the 3-stars with Node 1 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars with Node 1 as the central node.

3. Counting the 3-stars with Node 2 as the central node:
    - <2, (0, 1, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 4, 7)>

4. Counting the 3-stars with Node 4 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars with Node 4 as the central node.

5. Counting the 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars with Node 5 as the central node.

6. Counting the 3-stars with Node 6 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars with Node 6 as the central node.

7. Counting the 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node.

8. Counting the 3-stars with Node 8 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars with Node 8 as the central node.

9. Counting the 3-stars with Node 9 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars with Node 9 as the central node.

[Total number of 3-stars: 2]
