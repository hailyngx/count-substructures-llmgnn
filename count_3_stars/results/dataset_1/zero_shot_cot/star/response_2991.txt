Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes but the other three nodes aren't connected to each other.

Given the edges provided, let's first identify the 3-star structures:

- <0, (2, 7, 1)>
- <1, (2, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
