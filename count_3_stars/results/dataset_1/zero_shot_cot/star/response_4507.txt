Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 9)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [4]
