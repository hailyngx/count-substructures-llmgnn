Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
    1. <0, (1, 5, 5)>
    2. <1, (0, 2, 2)>
    3. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
    4. <2, (4, 5, 8)>
    5. <3, (5, 6, 9)>
    6. <4, (2, 2, 8)>
    7. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
    8. <6, (5, 3, 9)>
    9. <8, (2, 9, 9)>
    10. <9, (3, 6, 8)>
    
    Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
