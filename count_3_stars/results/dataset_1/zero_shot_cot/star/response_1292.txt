Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the 3-stars based on the given edges. 
Since a 3-star graph has exactly 3 leaves, we will find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following central nodes:
- Node 2
- Node 7
- Node 3

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
