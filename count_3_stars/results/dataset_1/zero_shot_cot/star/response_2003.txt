Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we first need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by counting the number of unique configurations listed above:
