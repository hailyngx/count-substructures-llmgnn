Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their connected nodes.

The central nodes are nodes with exactly three adjacent edges. From the given graph, the nodes that satisfy this condition are: 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's find the leaves for each central node:
- For central node 2, the leaves are nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- For central node 4, the leaves are nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- For central node 6, the leaves are nodes 0, 3, and 9.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<2, (5, 7, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>

So, the final answer is [7].
