Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 9

Next, we list all the nodes that are connected to node 1:
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 9

Now, for each node, we check if it forms a 3-star with exactly 3 other nodes. 

For node 0, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 1, we have the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>

For node 3, we have the following 3-stars:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (8, 1, 4)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>

For node 4, we have the following 3-stars:
<4, (1, 8, 7)>
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>

For node 7, we have the following 3-star:
<7, (0, 2, 9)>

For node 9, we have the following 3-stars:
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 1, 3)>

Hence, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (8, 1, 4)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (1, 8, 7)>
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 1, 3)>
