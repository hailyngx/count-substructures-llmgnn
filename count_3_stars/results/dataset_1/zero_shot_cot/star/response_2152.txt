Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we are looking for nodes with three adjacent nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
[<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
