Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes with three connections are: 0, 7, 5, 1, 8, 9

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, -)>
<9, (0, 5, -)>

Since we have considered all the possible 3-stars, the final count is [6].
