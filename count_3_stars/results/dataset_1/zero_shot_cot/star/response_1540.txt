Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star in the graph. We need to find nodes with exactly three incident edges.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with three incident edges are:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 5
- Node 8

Next, we will construct the 3-stars using these central nodes and their adjacent nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 9, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
