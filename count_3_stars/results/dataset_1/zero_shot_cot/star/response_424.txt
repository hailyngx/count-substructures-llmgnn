Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7
- Node 2 is connected to node 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4
- Node 6 is connected to node 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 9
- Node 8 is connected to node 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7

Next, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
