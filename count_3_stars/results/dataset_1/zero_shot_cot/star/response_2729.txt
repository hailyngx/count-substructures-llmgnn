Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 9)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 9)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 7)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 9)>

So, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
