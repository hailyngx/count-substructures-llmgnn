Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 0. These are nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.  
Now, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- So, the number of 3-stars with the center at node 3 is 1.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- So, the number of 3-stars with the center at node 4 is 1.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- So, the number of 3-stars with the center at node 6 is 1.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to node 0.
- Since node 9 has only one connection, it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
