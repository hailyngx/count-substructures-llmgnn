Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Given the definition of a 3-star, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list them here first:

1 is connected to 2 nodes: 4 and 5.
3 is connected to 2 nodes: 2 and 9.
6 is not connected to any other node.
7 is connected to 2 nodes: 2 and 4.

Now, let's go through each possible 3-star based on the above information and the given edges and count the total number of 3-stars:

1. <1, (4, 5)> - 1 is the center node connected to 4 and 5.
2. <3, (2, 9)> - 3 is the center node connected to 2 and 9.
3. <7, (2, 4)> - 7 is the center node connected to 2 and 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
