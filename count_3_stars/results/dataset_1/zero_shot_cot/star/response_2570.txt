Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to node 0
- Node 4 is connected to node 1
- Nodes 5 and 6 are connected to each other
- Node 7 is connected to node 2

Now, let's count the 3-star graphs:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
