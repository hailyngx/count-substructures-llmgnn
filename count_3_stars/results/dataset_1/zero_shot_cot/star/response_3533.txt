Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 9, -)>
3. <2, (1, 6, -)>
4. <3, (8, 9, -)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
6. <5, (0, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
8. <7, (4, 5, -)>
9. <8, (0, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [10].
