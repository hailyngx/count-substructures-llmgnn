Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, and the graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can start by listing all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
