Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars by finding the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list the 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<8, (3, 4, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:

[10]
