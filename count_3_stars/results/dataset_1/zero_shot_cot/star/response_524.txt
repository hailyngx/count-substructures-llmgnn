Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 8)>
4. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
6. <6, (0, 7, 8)>
7. <8, (0, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
