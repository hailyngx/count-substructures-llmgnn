Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 8
- Node 6: 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (2, 3, 5)
- Node 1: (2, 3, 6), (2, 3, 8)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 4)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 8)
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: (1, 3, 9)
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: (1, 3, 5)
- Node 9: No 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5)>
