Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can act as the center of a 3-star, with the neighboring nodes forming the leaves. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 2 is a center with neighbors 3, 7, and 9: <2, (3, 7, 9)>
2. Node 3 is a center with neighbors 2 and 4: <3, (2, 4)>
3. Node 4 is a center with neighbor 3: <4, (3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
