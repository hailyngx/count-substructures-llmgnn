Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars with the center being each node in the graph.

We will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, based on the definition of a 3-star graph.

Let's start by listing the nodes along with their number of edges:
- Node 0: 6 edges
- Node 1: 3 edges
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 3: 4 edges
- Node 4: 3 edges
- Node 5: 2 edges
- Node 6: 2 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 8: 1 edge
- Node 9: 5 edges

Now, let's list the 3-stars with their central node and leaves:
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5] 3-stars.
