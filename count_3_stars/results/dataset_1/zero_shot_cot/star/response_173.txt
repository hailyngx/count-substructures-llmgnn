Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 1)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
