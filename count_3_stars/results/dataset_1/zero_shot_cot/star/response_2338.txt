Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 9, 7)>
<1, (7, 9, 0)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
