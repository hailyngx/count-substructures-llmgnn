Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1: (0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)
   - Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6)
   - Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9)
   - Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
   - Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3)
   - Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 9)
   - Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 7)

2. Construct 3-stars for each node connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>
   - Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
   - Node 3: <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
   - Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>
   - Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 4)>
   - Node 7: <7, (0, 3, 9)>
   - Node 9: <9, (3, 7, 7)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 7)>
