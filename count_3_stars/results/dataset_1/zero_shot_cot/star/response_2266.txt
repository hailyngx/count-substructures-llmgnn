Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 2)>
2. <3, (0, 6, 9)>
3. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <6, (3, 5, 8)>
5. <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [5]
