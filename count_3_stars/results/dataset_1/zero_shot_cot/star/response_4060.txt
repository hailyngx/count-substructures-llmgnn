Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in the graph: 

1. Find all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
   - Node 3 has neighbors 5, 6, and 8.
   - Node 4 has neighbors 8 and 9.
   - Node 7 has neighbors 5 and 6.

2. Form 3-stars using the nodes identified in step 1:
   - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <4, (8, 9)>
   - <7, (5, 6)>

Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars found as requested:
