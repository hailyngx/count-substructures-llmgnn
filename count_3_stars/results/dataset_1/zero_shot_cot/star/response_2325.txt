Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 2, 8)>

2. From node 1:
   - <1, (0, 4, 8)>

3. From node 2:
   - <2, (3, 4, 7)>

4. From node 3:
   - <3, (2, 5, 7)>

5. From node 4:
   - <4, (0, 2, 8)>

6. From node 5:
   - <5, (3, 6, 9)>

7. From node 6:
   - <6, (5, 8, 9)>

8. From node 7:
   - <7, (0, 2, 9)>

9. From node 8:
   - <8, (0, 4, 6)>

10. From node 9:
   - <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
