Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting from each node, we will identify the 3-stars that have it as the center.

1. For node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
    - The 3-stars with 0 as the center are: <0, (2, 7)>.

2. For node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
    - The 3-stars with 1 as the center are: <1, (5, 6, 7)>.

3. For node 2:
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
    - The 3-stars with 2 as the center are: <2, (0, 4, 9)>.

4. For node 3:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
    - The 3-stars with 3 as the center are: <3, (5, 6)>.

5. For node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
    - The 3-stars with 4 as the center are: <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>.

6. For node 5:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
    - The 3-stars with 5 as the center are: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>.

7. For node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
    - The 3-stars with 6 as the center are: <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>.

8. For node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
    - The 3-stars with 7 as the center are: <7, (0, 1)>.

9. For node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
    - The 3-stars with 8 as the center are: <8, (4, 6)>.

10. For node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
    - The 3-stars with 9 as the center are: <9, (2, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
    
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>.
