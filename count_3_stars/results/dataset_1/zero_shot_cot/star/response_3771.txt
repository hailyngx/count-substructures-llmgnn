Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph step by step:
1. Start by looking for all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each such center node, find the three nodes that are connected to it.
3. List the unique 3-stars found.

Based on the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 6)>  
<1, (2, 5, 9)>   
<4, (5, 8, 9)>  
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 4 unique 3-stars in total.   
So, the final answer is [4].
