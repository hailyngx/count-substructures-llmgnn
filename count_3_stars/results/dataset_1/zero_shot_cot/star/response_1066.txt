Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars present.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
- Node 0: Connects to node 2
- Node 1: Connects to nodes 5, 6
- Node 2: Connects to node 0
- Node 4: Connects to nodes 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: Connects to nodes 1, 4
- Node 6: Connects to nodes 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: Connects to nodes 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: Connects to node 7
- Node 9: Connects to nodes 4, 6, 7

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
- From the analysis:
  - Node 1 can form 1 3-star <1, (5, 6)>
  - Node 4 can form 4 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
  - Node 7 can form 1 3-star <7, (6, 9, 4)>
  
Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
The total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 7) = 6

[6]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
