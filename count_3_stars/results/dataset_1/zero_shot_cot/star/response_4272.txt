Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three associated nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's begin by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [6].
