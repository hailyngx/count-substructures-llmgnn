Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
