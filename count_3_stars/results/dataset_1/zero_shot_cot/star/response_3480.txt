Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would indicate the presence of a 3-star.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (3, 6, 7)> and <1, (6, 5, 7)>.
- There is 1 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (1, 5, 7)>.
- There is 1 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (5, 9, 9)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
