Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 8)>
2. Node 3 forms 2 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 8)> and <3, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
4. Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
