Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7, 8
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-star motifs in this graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 4, -)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 5, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-star motifs in the given graph.
