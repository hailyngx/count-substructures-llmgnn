Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, None)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (9, None, None)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars listed. 

There are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
