Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 7, 6)>
   [2]

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 7, 2)>
   [1]

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <2, (0, 7, 6)>
   - <2, (3, 4, 8)>
   [3]

4. For node 6:
   - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
   [1]

5. For node 7:
   - <7, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <7, (8, 9, 1)>
   [3]

6. For node 8:
   - <8, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <8, (2, 9, 7)>
   [2]

7. For node 9:
   - <9, (7, 8, 1)>
   - <9, (7, 8, 2)>
   [2]
