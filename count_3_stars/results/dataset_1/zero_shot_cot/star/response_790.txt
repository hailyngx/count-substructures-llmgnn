Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edge list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Here they are:
<0, (2, 5, _)>  
<1, (2, 8, 9)>  
<2, (0, 1, 9)>  
<5, (0, 3, _)>  
<8, (1, 2, 9)>  
<9, (1, 2, 8)>  

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
