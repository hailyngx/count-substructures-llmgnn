Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star.
2. Count the number of 3-stars for each center node.

Here are the number of 3-stars for each center node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 1
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 2
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
