Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its 3 connected nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 0)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (5, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 9, 8)>
<9, (8, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
