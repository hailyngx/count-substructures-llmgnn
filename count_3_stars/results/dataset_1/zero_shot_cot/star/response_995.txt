Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is the center and the other two nodes are connected only to the center.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. The 3-star with center node 0: <(0), (5, 6)>
2. The 3-star with center node 1: <(1), (3, 4)>
3. The 3-star with center node 2: <(2), (3, 6)>
4. The 3-star with center node 3: <(3), (1, 2)>
5. The 3-star with center node 4: <(4), (1, 9)>
6. The 3-star with center node 5: <(5), (0, 1)>
7. The 3-star with center node 6: <(6), (0, 2)>
8. The 3-star with center node 8: <(8), (2, 9)>
9. The 3-star with center node 9: <(9), (0, 4)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
