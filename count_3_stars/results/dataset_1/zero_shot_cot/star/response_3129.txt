Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

From the provided edges, we can observe the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 7)>
3. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
4. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
5. <1, (6, 7, 9)>
6. <2, (3, 5)>
7. <4, (9)>
8. <5, (0, 2)>

Now, to calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we simply count the unique 3-stars we found. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
