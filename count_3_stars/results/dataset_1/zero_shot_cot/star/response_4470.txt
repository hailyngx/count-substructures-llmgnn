Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

- From the given edge list, we can see the following 3-stars:
    1. <0, (6, 9)>
    2. <1, (2, 6, 8)>
    3. <2, (1, 4, 9)>
    4. <3, (4, 6, 7)>
    5. <4, (2, 3, 7)>
    6. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
    7. <7, (2, 3, 4)>
    8. <8, (1, 2, 5)>
    9. <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
