Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the information about the graph:

- Node 0: 1 edge
- Node 1: 3 edges
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 3: 5 edges
- Node 4: 1 edge
- Node 5: 1 edge
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 7: 3 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 2 edges

We can see that nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes each, forming 3-stars.

Additionally, there is a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (3, 8, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 8, 5)>
