Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>

By counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
