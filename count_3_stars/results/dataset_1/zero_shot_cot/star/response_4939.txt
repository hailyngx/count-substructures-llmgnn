Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central nodes in the graph are: 0, 3, 4, 8.

For each central node, let's identify the nodes connected to it:
- For central node 0: (1, 3, 5, 7)
- For central node 3: (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- For central node 4: (3, 6, 8)
- For central node 8: (3, 4, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- For central node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)> and <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- For central node 3: <3, (0, 2, 4)> and <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- For central node 4: <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- For central node 8: <8, (3, 4, 6)> and <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>.
