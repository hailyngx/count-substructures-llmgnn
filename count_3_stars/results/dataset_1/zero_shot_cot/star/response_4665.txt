Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and check if they form a 3-star. 

Let's go step by step:

1. **Node 0:** Node 0 has only one neighbor which is node 3. Node 0 does not form a 3-star.

2. **Node 1:** Node 1 has three neighbors: 6, 8, and 6. So, the three-star with node 1 as the center is <1, (6, 8, 6)>.

3. **Node 2:** Node 2 has four neighbors: 3, 4, 7, and 8. So, the three-stars with node 2 as the center are <2, (3, 4, 7)> and <2, (3, 7, 8)>.

4. **Node 3:** Node 3 has four neighbors: 0, 2, 5, and 7. So, the three-stars with node 3 as the center are <3, (0, 2, 5)> and <3, (2, 5, 7)>.

5. **Node 4:** Node 4 has one neighbor which is 2. Node 4 does not form a 3-star.

6. **Node 5:** Node 5 has only one neighbor which is 3. Node 5 does not form a 3-star.

7. **Node 6:** Node 6 has two neighbors: 1 and 8. Node 6 does not form a 3-star.

8. **Node 7:** Node 7 has two neighbors: 2 and 3. Node 7 does not form a 3-star.

9. **Node 8:** Node 8 has four neighbors: 1, 2, 6, and 2. So, the three-star with node 8 as the center is <8, (1, 6, 2)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are <1, (6, 8, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, and <3, (0, 2, 5)>.
