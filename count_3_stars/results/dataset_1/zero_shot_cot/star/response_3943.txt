Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would form the centers of the 3-stars. Then for each of these central nodes, we can find the three nodes that are connected to them, creating unique 3-stars.

Let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (2, 3, 4, 9).
- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes (2, 6, 8, 9).
- Node 2 is connected to 5 other nodes (0, 1, 5, 7, 8).
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 5, 9).
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 8, 9).
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes (2, 3, 6, 8).
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 5, 9).
- Node 8 is connected to 4 other nodes (1, 2, 4, 5).
- Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 1, 3, 6).

Therefore, the central nodes for 3-stars are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9.

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)> and <0, (2, 4, 9)>.
- For node 1: <1, (2, 6, 8)> and <1, (2, 8, 9)>.
- For node 2: <2, (0, 1, 5)> and <2, (0, 5, 7)>.
- For node 5: <5, (2, 3, 6)> and <5, (2, 6, 8)>.
- For node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)> and <8, (1, 2, 5)>.
- For node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)> and <9, (1, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>.
