Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5
- Node 1: Connected to node 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 3
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 4
- Node 7: Connected to node 1
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 4

2. Based on the connections, we can manually identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 3, 4)>

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
