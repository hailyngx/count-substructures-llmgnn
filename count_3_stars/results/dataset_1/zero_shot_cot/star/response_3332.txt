Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is part of one potential 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
  
Moving on to node 2:
- Node 2 is part of one potential 3-star: <2, (1, 9, 5)>

Moving on to node 3:
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star.

Moving on to node 4:
- Node 4 is part of one potential 3-star: <4, (9, 5, 3)>

Moving on to node 5:
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.

Moving on to node 6:
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star.

Moving on to node 7:
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star.

Moving on to node 8:
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star.

Moving on to node 9:
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, based on the given graph, the number of 3-stars is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 9, 5)>, and <4, (9, 5, 3)>.
