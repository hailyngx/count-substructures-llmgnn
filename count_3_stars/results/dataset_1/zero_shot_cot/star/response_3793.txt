Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of central nodes and their adjacent nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
Node 0: {1, 5}
Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 9}
Node 2: {4}
Node 3: {1, 6}
Node 4: {2, 5, 7}
Node 5: {0, 4, 6}
Node 6: {3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 7: {1, 4, 6}
Node 8: {9}
Node 9: {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's list all the 3-star combinations:

<0, (1, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is therefore: [8].
