Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
    - Nodes 1, 2, 4, 9 have 3 neighbors each.
    
Step 2: Check the neighbors of the identified central nodes for 3-stars.
    
    For Node 1:
        - Node 1: (0, 6, 9)
        - Node 2: (1, 4, 9)
        - Node 4: (1, 2, 9)
        - Node 9: (1, 4, 7)
    
    For Node 2:
        - Node 1: (0, 6, 1)
        - Node 2: (1, 3, 4)
        - Node 4: (1, 3, 9)
        - Node 9: (1, 2, 4)
        
    For Node 4:
        - Node 1: (1, 2, 4)
        - Node 2: (1, 3, 4)
        - Node 4: (2, 3, 7)
        - Node 9: (1, 7, 9)
    
    For Node 9:
        - Node 1: (1, 4, 9)
        - Node 2: (1, 4, 9)
        - Node 4: (2, 7, 9)
        - Node 9: (1, 4, 7)
        
Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars.
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (1, 4, 7)>,
                      <2, (0, 6, 1)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 2, 4)>,
                      <4, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 4)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>,
                      <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
                      
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
