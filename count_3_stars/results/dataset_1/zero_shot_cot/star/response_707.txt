Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
- From the connections, we can see that (2, 6, 8) form a 3-star with central node 2. This is the only 3-star in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
Unique 3-stars found: <<2, (6, 8, 2)>>
