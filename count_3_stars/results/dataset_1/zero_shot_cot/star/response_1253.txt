Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (3, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [5].
