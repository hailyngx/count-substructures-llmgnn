Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. Nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors are the potential center nodes of 3-stars. These are nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, 9.

For each potential center node, we will check if it forms a 3-star. To form a 3-star, the central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8. <0, (1, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.

Now, let's move on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. <1, (0, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.

Moving to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4. However, node 2 is not exactly connected to 3 other nodes, so it does not form a 3-star.

Proceeding to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9. <8, (0, 1, 9)> is a 3-star.

Finally, let's check node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8. Node 9 is not exactly connected to 3 other nodes, so it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 8)> and <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
