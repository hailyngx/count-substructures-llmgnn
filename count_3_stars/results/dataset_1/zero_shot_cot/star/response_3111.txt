Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Now, let's list down all the 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [6] 3-stars.
