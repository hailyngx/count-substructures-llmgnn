Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (2, 3, 5)
2. Node 2: (0, 1, 4)
3. Node 3: (0, 6, 8)
4. Node 5: (0, 1, 8)
5. Node 6: (0, 3, 8)
6. Node 8: (3, 5, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>
