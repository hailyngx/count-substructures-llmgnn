Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three edges, as those will be the centers of the 3-stars. Based on the given edges, we find the following central nodes:

- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars with the identified central nodes:

- 3-stars with center 0: <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- 3-stars with center 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- 3-stars with center 3: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- 3-stars with center 4: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- 3-stars with center 7: <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- 3-stars with center 8: <8, (2, 5, 8)>
- 3-stars with center 9: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
