Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 1)>
<1, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (1, 8, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 0)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
