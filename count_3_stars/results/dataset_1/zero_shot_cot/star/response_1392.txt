Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

There are a few steps we need to follow:
1. Identify the central node of each potential 3-star.
2. Check if the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. If the central node is connected to three other nodes, confirm if these nodes are connected to each other.

Let's start by listing all the potential 3-stars based on the given edges:

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (6, 7)>
  
Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
