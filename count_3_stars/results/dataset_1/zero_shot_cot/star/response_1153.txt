Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in a star pattern.

Let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [7].
