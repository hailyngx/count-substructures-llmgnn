Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
