Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star based on the definition provided (a center node connected to exactly three other nodes). 

First, let's list all the nodes and their connections:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 6.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 4.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 3 and 6.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by looking at each node as a potential center and checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes:

- For Node 1: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 2: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 3: <3, (5, 9, 4)>
- For Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 3, 6)>
- For Node 5: Not a center of a 3-star.
- For Node 6: <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 1, 9)>
- For Node 9: Not a center of a 3-star.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars we found:
- Total unique 3-stars: 3

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (5, 9, 4)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
