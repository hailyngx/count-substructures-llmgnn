Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

To start, we can list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, -)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, -, -)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, -, -)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, -, -)>
<9, (4, -, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
