Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Given the description of the graph, let's list down the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, ? , ?)> (Not enough information to complete this 3-star)

To count the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we simply count the unique ones above.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
