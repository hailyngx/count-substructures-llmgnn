Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can observe that a 3-star requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can identify each 3-star by looking for nodes that meet this criteria.

Let's go step-by-step and find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the information given, we see that the nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9.

2. Let's start looking for 3-stars:
   - Node 1 has 6 connections: (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8).
   - Node 4 has 6 connections: (1, 4), (2, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8).
   - Node 5 has 3 connections: (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8).
   - Node 8 has 4 connections: (1, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 9).
   
3. We can see that nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8 are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars:
   - 3-star with central node 1: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   - 3-star with central node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
   - 3-star with central node 8: <8, (1, 4, 5)>
   
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
