Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
