Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph described above can have multiple 3-stars. Let's find them step-by-step:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 5), (2, 0), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 3)

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns:

1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <3, (7, 8, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
4. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
5. <6, (4, 5, 7)>
6. <7, (3, 4, 5)>
7. <8, (3, 7)>
8. <9, (3)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
