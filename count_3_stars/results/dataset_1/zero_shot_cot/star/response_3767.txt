Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 8) (4 in total)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 5), (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 7), (1, 3, 5) (6 in total)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 8), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 8) (4 in total)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 5), (3, 2, 5) (4 in total)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 7), (5, 0, 8), (5, 3, 7), (5, 3, 8) (4 in total)
- Node 6: No 3-stars
- Node 7: (7, 1, 5) (1 in total)
- Node 8: No 3-stars

Step 3: Consolidate the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars found [12].
    <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>
