Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go step-by-step to find the unique 3-stars:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.

From the edge list, we can see that nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9 have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

2. For each potential center node, check the neighboring nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 6, -)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5].
