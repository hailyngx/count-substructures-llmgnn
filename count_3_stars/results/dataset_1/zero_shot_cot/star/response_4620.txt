Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- 3-star with center at node 3: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- 3-star with center at node 5: <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- 3-star with center at node 9: <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
