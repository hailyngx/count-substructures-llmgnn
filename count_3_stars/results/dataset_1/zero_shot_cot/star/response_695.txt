Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 8

Next, let's identify all 3-stars in this graph by finding all possible combinations of a central node and its three connected nodes:
1. For Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 8)> and <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. For Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)> and <1, (4, 5, 9)>
3. For Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 6)> and <2, (0, 4, 7)>
4. For Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 7)> and <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. For Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 3)> and <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. For Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 4)> and <5, (0, 1, 7)>
7. For Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 5)>
8. For Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 4)> and <8, (0, 1, 5)>
9. For Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)> and <9, (0, 1, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>.
