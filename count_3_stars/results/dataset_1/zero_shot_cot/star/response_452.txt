Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find and list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, -)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, -, -)>
<5, (3, 8, -)>
<6, (3, -, -)>
<7, (3, 9, -)>
<8, (1, 5, -)>
<9, (7, -, -)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
