Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 2, there are 3 potential 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, and <2, (7, 3, 9)>.
- For node 3, there are no 3-stars since it does not have 3 nodes connected to it.
- For node 5, there are no 3-stars since it does not have 3 nodes connected to it.
- For node 6, there are no 3-stars since it does not have 3 nodes connected to it.
- For node 7, there are no 3-stars since it does not have 3 nodes connected to it.
- For node 8, there are no 3-stars since it does not have 3 nodes connected to it.
- For node 9, there are no 3-stars since it does not have 3 nodes connected to it.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, and <2, (7, 3, 9)>.
