Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
