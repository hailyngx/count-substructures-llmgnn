Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, -)>
<3, (7, 9, -)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, -)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Count = 10 [ ]
