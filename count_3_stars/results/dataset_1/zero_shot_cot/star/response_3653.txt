Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the number of 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. Let's denote the nodes with three neighbors as potential central nodes and then confirm if they form 3-stars.

1. Node 2 has three neighbors: 3, 5, and 6. Therefore, potential 3-star: (2, 3, 5, 6)
2. Node 3 has three neighbors: 2, 7, and 7. Therefore, potential 3-star: (3, 2, 7, 7)
3. Node 5 has three neighbors: 2, 6, and 9. Therefore, potential 3-star: (5, 2, 6, 9)
4. Node 6 has four neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 7 has four neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 9 has three neighbors: 5, 6, and 6. Therefore, potential 3-star: (9, 5, 6, 6)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 7, 7)>, and <5, (2, 6, 9)>.
