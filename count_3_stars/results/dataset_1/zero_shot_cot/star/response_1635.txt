Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, any node with degree 3 in the graph can potentially be the central node of a 3-star.

From the given edges, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1

Nodes 1 and 6 have a degree of 5, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph with nodes 1 and 6 as the central nodes.

For node 1:
1. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
5. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
6. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
7. <1, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 6:
8. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
9. <6, (2, 4, 5)>
10. <6, (2, 3, 5)>
     
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10] <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>.
