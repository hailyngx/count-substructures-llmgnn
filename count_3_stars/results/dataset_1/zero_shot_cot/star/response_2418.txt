Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3, these could be potential central nodes in 3-stars.
- Node 2 and Node 8 have degree 3.

Step 2: For each potential central node, identify the connected nodes as leaves in 3-stars.
- For Node 2: (2, 1, 8, 9) forms a 3-star.
- For Node 8: (8, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7) forms two 3-stars.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
- Total 3-stars: 3
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (6, 7)>
