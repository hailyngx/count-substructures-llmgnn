Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first list all the nodes with their adjacent nodes:
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 2, 4
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [4].
