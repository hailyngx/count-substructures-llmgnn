Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6. <4, (0, 2, 6)>
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, and <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
