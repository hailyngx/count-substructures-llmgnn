Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star configuration. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step:

1. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to identify possible 3-stars.
2. We will then list all unique 3-stars found.

Let's start with the given graph:

Nodes:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 5), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 4)

Let's find the unique 3-stars:

<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars [2].
