Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Center: 8, Leaves: 1, 2, 3
2. Center: 1, Leaves: 4, 9, 8
3. Center: 4, Leaves: 1, 2, 3
4. Center: 7, Leaves: 8, 9, 1
5. Center: 9, Leaves: 1, 7, 8

Therefore, there are 5 3-stars in the graph.

So, the final answer is: [5]
