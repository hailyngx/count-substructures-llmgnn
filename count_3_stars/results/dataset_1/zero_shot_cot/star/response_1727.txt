Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first list out all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[7]
