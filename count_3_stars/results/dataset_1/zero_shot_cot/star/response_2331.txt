Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we have the following nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 7)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 8, 9)>.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 4)> and <7, (0, 4, 5)>.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>
