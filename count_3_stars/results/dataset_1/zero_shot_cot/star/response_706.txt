Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>

Count: [3]
