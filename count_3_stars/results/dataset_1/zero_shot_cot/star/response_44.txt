Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

First, let's list all nodes along with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 9.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 4 and Node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 4, Node 5, and Node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to Node 2, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 5 and Node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- From the connections, we see that Node 9 forms 3-stars with Nodes 0, 1, 5; 1, 4, 9; 2, 5, 9; 7, 5, 9; 8, 9, 4 (leaves are listed in ascending order).
- Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>.

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
