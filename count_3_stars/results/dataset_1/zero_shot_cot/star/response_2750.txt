Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A central node in a 3-star graph must have degree 3. 
From the given edge list, we can see that the nodes 0, 3, and 6 have degree 6, 5, and 4 respectively, making them the potential central nodes.

Let's now enumerate the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (5, 3, 6)>
2. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>
3. Node 6: <6, (0, 3, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found [5] 3-stars in total.
