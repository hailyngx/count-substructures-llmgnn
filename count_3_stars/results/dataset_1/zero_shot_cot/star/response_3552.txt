Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. (0, 1, 3, 6)
2. (1, 0, 2, 4)
3. (1, 4, 5, 9)
4. (2, 1, 6, 5)
5. (3, 0, 6, 9)
6. (4, 1, 7, 8)
7. (5, 1, 6, 7)
8. (5, 4, 8, 7)
9. (6, 0, 2, 5)
10. (7, 4, 5, 8)
11. (8, 4, 7, 9)
12. (8, 5, 7, 4)
13. (9, 0, 1, 8)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph: [13]

Therefore, the final answer is [13]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
