Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's list all 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (5)>
<7, (1, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [11].
