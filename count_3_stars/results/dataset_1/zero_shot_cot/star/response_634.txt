Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
7. <7, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
