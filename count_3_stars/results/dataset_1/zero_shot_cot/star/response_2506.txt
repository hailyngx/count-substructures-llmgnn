Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by listing the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 7, 5)>
<7, (6, -)>
<8, (3, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
