Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

Nodes with degree:
- 0: 5 edges
- 1: 3 edges
- 2: 2 edges
- 3: 3 edges
- 4: 4 edges
- 5: 1 edge
- 6: 4 edges
- 7: 4 edges
- 8: 5 edges
- 9: 3 edges

Considering the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list down the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 1)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
