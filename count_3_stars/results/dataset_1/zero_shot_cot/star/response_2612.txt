Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The center node can be any node in the graph with at least 3 neighbors. The nodes which satisfy this condition are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Now, let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 2, 8)>
<0, (5, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (6, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 0)>
<9, (0, 9, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
