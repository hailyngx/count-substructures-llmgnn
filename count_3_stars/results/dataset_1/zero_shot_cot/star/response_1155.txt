Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can analyze which nodes are connected to each other. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, -)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
