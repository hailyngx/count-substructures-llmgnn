Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Looking at the provided edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to node 0
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
1. From above, we have the following possible 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
   - <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
