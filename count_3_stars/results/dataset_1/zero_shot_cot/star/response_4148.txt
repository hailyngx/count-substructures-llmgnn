Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars:

- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
