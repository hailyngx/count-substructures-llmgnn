Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are five 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (7, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (8, 1, 9)>
