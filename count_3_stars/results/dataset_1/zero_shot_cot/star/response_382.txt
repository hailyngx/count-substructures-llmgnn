Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.
   
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.

5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.

Thus, the only 3-star in this graph is centered at node 0: <0, (2, 5, 6)>. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].  
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
