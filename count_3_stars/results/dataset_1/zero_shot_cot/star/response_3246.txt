Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
