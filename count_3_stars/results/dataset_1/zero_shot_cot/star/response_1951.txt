Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique 3-stars by identifying nodes that are connected in the 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 5)
   - Node 4 has 2 neighbors (2, 5)

2. Create a list of 3-stars based on the central node and its connected nodes:
   - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (2, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get:
