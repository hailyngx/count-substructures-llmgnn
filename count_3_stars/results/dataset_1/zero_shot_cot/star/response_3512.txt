Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Given the edges provided, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
