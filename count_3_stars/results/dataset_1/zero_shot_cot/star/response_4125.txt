Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

The possible 3-star configurations can be:
1. (0, 3, 5)
2. (1, 3, 7)
3. (2, 4, 5)
4. (3, 0, 1)
5. (3, 6, 8)
6. (3, 8, 9)
7. (4, 2, 5)
8. (4, 7, 9)
9. (5, 0, 4)
10. (5, 4, 7)
11. (6, 3, 8)
12. (7, 1, 4)
13. (7, 4, 5)
14. (7, 8, 9)
15. (8, 3, 6)
16. (8, 6, 7)
17. (8, 7, 9)
18. (9, 3, 4)
19. (9, 4, 7)

Counting them all, we have a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5)>
<1, (3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1)>
<3, (6, 8)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5)>
<4, (7, 9)>
<5, (0, 4)>
<5, (4, 7)>
<6, (3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4)>
<7, (4, 5)>
<7, (8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6)>
<8, (6, 7)>
<8, (7, 9)>
<9, (3, 4)>
<9, (4, 7)>
