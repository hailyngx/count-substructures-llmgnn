Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <6, (0, 4, 5)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
