Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by identifying the central node for each potential 3-star. We will then check if each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star.

Here is the breakdown of the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Central node 1: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. Central node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 5, 6)>
4. Central node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. This forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
5. Central node 5: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
6. Central node 6: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
7. Central node 7: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
8. Central node 8: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
9. Central node 9: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are <0, (2, 4, 5)> and <2, (0, 5, 6)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
