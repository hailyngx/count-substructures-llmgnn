Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <3, (0, 7, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
5. <8, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
