Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 8)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 9)>
4. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
5. <2, (4, 7, 1)>
6. <3, (4, 7, 5)>
7. <4, (2, 5, 6)>
8. <5, (0, 1, 4)>
9. <5, (4, 6, 7)>
10. <6, (4, 5, 8)>
11. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
12. <8, (0, 1, 6)>
13. <9, (1, 5, 6)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
