Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify all nodes that are connected to node 0 since node 0 will be the center node in all 3-stars:

- Nodes connected to node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6}

Now, for each node connected to node 0, we will check if it has exactly three edges. If it does, then we have a 3-star centered at node 0 with that node and the other nodes connected to it as leaves.

Let's list the 3-stars:

- 3-stars:
  <0, (2, 5, 6)>
  <0, (4, 5, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [2].
