Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with degree 3 are the potential central nodes for 3-star graphs. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 9, and 8 have degree 4, which means they are the central nodes.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 0:
    <0, (2, 9, 7)>
    <0, (4, 7, 9)>

2. For node 9:
    <9, (0, 5, 6)>
    <9, (6, 8, 0)>
    <9, (8, 5, 6)>

3. For node 8:
    <8, (3, 9, 6)>
    <8, (9, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
