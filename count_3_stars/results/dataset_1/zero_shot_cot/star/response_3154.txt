Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.

Based on the connections, we can identify the 3-star patterns present in the graph:
<0, (4, 9)>  
<1, (4)>  
<2, (8)>  
<3, (4, 5, 8)>  
<4, (0, 1, 3, 6)>  
<5, (3, 6)>  
<6, (4, 5, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3)>  
<9, (0, 6)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
