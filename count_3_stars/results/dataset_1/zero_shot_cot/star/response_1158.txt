Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
In this graph, node 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

Step 2: For each of the identified nodes, check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star.
Let's check each of the identified nodes:
For node 2: (2, 0, 3, 5) forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center.
For node 4: (4, 6, 7, 8) forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center.
For node 6: (6, 3, 4, 8) forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center.
For node 7: (7, 4, 6, 9) forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center.
For node 8: (8, 4, 6) doesn't form a 3-star because it only has two leaves. 

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.
The total number of 3-stars found in the graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
