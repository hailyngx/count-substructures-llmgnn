Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0 
- Node 4 
- Node 7 
- Node 8 

Next, we will determine the leaves connected to each of these central nodes to form the 3-stars. 

For Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8)
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>

For Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6)
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>

For Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5)
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>

For Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 7), (8, 9)
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [6] 

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
