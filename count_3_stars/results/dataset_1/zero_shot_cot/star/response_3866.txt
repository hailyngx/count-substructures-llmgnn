Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's list all nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 4, 7)> and <4, (2, 3, 6)>.
