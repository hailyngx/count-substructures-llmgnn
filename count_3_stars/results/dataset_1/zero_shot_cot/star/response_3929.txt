Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To identify the 3-star structures in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Since node 0 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (1, 2, and 3), we have a 3-star centered at node 0. <0, (1, 2, 3)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9. Since node 1 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (0, 2, and 4), we have another 3-star centered at node 1. <1, (0, 2, 4)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8. Since node 2 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (0, 1, and 4), we have another 3-star centered at node 2. <2, (0, 1, 4)>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Since node 4 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (0, 1, and 2), we have another 3-star centered at node 4. <4, (0, 1, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is []4[].
