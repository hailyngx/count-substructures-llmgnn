Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the center node first. The center node is the node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these potential center nodes. A 3-star is formed when the center node is connected to three other nodes.

Potential center nodes: 1, 3, 6, and 8.

For each potential center node, count the number of 3-stars:
- Center node 1 has 3-stars with (3, 7, 8) and (8, 7, 6). (2 3-stars)
- Center node 3 has 1 3-star with (1, 8, 1). (1 3-star)
- Center node 6 has 1 3-star with (0, 1, 8). (1 3-star)
- Center node 8 has 3-stars with (1, 3, 6), (3, 1, 7), (4, 5, 6). (3 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6] in total.
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (8, 7, 6)>, <3, (1, 8, 1)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 1, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>.
