Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node has exactly 3 edges connecting it to other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 7)>
- <1, (5)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (3, 4)>
- <9, (3, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, we find there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
