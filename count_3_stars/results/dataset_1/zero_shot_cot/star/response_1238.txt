Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 4, 7), (0, 7, 9), (0, 4, 9)  
2. Node 1: (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 8), (1, 5, 9), (1, 6, 8)  
3. Node 2: (2, 5, 8)  
4. Node 3: (3, 5, 6)  
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 6), (4, 0, 5)  
6. Node 5: (5, 1, 8), (5, 1, 9), (5, 2, 8), (5, 3, 6), (5, 4, 6)  
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 4), (6, 3, 5)  
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 9), (7, 9, 1)  
9. Node 8: (8, 1, 5), (8, 2, 5)  
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 7), (9, 1, 5), (9, 0, 7)  

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 8)>, <3, (5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 4)>, <7, (0, 9)>, <8, (1, 5)>, <9, (0, 7)>.
