Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs in the given graph. A 3-star graph requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, the 3-star graphs can be identified as follows:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4: <8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph. So, the final answer is [5].
