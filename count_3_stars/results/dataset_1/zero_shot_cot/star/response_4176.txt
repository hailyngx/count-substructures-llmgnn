Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can serve as the center of a 3-star graph. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 5, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 3, 5
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7 has neighbors 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors 2, 5, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>

For counting the total number of 3-stars: [5]
