Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the nodes that can act as the central node of a 3-star. 

The nodes connected to each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 8

From the nodes connected to each node, we can see that the central nodes for 3-stars can be 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9. Now we can find the unique 3-stars:

- <0, (3, 4, 6)> 
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 2, 7)>
- <0, (6, 9, 3)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 0, 7)>
- <2, (5, 7, 2)>
- <4, (0, 2, 7)> 
- <4, (0, 7, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 5)>  
- <7, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (4, 0, 7)>
- <7, (5, 7, 2)>
- <9, (0, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (6, 0, 9)>
- <9, (8, 1, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
