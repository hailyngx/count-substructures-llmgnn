Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's analyze the given graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (6, 2, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 3)>
<4, (6, 0, empty)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 8, empty)>
<8, (5, 7, empty)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
