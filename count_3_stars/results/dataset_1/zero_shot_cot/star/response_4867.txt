Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would form the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and does not have a 3-star configuration.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9, and does not have a 3-star configuration.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 6, 5)>
<0, (1, 6, 2)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
