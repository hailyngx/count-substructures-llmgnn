Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. Given that a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
