Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all occurrences of 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes by edges. 

Given the provided edges:
(0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4)
(1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9)
(2, 3) (2, 7)
(3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8)
(4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6)
(5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9)
(6, 4)
(7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9)
(8, 1) (8, 3)
(9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7)

Let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
