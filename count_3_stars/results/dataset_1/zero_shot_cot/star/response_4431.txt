Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes connected in a star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:  
<1, (2, 4, 6)>  
<2, (1, 3, 7)>  
<2, (1, 4, 9)>  
<2, (3, 7, 9)>  
<3, (2, 5, 7)>  
<4, (1, 9, 2)>  
<6, (1, 1, 1)> (Not a valid 3-star due to repeated node)  

Counting all the unique 3-stars found: [6].
