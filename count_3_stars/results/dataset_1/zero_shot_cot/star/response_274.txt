Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars based on this pattern.

By examining the provided list of edges, we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
