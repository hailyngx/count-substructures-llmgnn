Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 9
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars present in this graph. We need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them which form a star:
1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>  
2. <0, (2, 3, 5)>  
3. <0, (2, 3, 7)>  
4. <0, (2, 4, 7)>  
5. <0, (3, 4, 5)>  
6. <0, (3, 4, 7)>  
7. <0, (3, 5, 7)>  
8. <0, (4, 5, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
