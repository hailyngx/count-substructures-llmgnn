Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 8)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 9)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 8)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 7)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
