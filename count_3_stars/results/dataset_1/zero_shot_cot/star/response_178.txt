Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 0. Node 0 is connected to node 6. So, we have the following 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (6, x, x)>. 

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9. So, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 2: 
<2, (4, 7, 8)> and <2, (5, 3, x)>.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 3. Node 3 is connected to node 5. So, we have the following 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (5, x, x)>.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8. So, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 4: 
<4, (2, 7, 8)> and <4, (7, 8, x)>.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. So, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 6: 
<6, (0, x, x)> and <6, (2, 8, x)>.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. So, we have the following 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (4, 8, x)>.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7. So, we have the following 3-stars centered at node 8: 
<8, (4, 6, 7)> and <8, (6, 7, x)>.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected directly to node 9. Node 9 is connected to node 2. So, we have the following 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (2, x, x)>.

Counting all the unique 3-star patterns found, we get a total of 9 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
