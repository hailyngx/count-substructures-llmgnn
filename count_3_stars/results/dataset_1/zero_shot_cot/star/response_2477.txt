Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to node 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (8, 3, 9)>
- <1, (6, 2, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>

 Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
