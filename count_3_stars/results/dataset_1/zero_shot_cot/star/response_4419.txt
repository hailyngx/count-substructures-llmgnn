Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
4. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
5. <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
