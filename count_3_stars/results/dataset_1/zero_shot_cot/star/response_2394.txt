Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

There are 10 nodes (0 to 9) in the graph. Since the graph is undirected, we need to consider each edge only once.

Based on the edge list provided, the 3-star subgraphs can be identified as follows:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <7, (1, 3, 8)>
7. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
