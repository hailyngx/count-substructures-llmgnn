Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list them as unique 3-stars and then count them.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
1. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <3, (1, 5, 8)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <5, (0, 3, 8)>
5. <6, (1, 8, 9)>
6. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
7. <9, (7, 8, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
