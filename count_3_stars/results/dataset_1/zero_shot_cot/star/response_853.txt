Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars it contains.

Given edges:
- (0, 6)
- (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8)
- (3, 4), (3, 6)
- (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)
- (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7)
- (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 5)
- (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5)
- (8, 1), (8, 2)

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star.

Nodes that can be central nodes:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5, 7, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 4, 7, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 5)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 1, 5, 2)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- 3-stars with center at node 1: <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- 3-stars with center at node 2: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- 3-stars with center at node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- 3-stars with center at node 5: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- 3-stars with center at node 7: <7, (1, 5, 2)>
- 3-stars with center at node 8: <8, (1, 2)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
