Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's go step by step and identify the 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three connections:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 0 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Now let's enumerate the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <6, (1, 3, 8)>
6. <8, (2, 3, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
