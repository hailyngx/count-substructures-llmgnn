Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node with exactly three edges, to form a 3-star structure. 
From the given edges, we can deduce the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7)>
<5, (2)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
