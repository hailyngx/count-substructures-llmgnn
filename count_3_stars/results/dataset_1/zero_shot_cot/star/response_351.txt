Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes with exactly three incident edges. In this graph, nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are central nodes.

Next, we look for 3-stars around each central node. Let's list them out:
- Central node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Central node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- Central node 3: <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- Central node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- Central node 7: <7, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] when counting unique 3-stars.
