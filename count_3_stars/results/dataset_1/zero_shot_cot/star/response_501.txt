Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6 
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7 
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8 
- Node 5: 3, 4 
- Node 6: 1, 3, 7, 8 
- Node 7: 3, 6, 9 
- Node 8: 4, 6 
- Node 9: 7 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8. <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 9. <7, (3, 6, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
