Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. We know that a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By looking at the provided edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
