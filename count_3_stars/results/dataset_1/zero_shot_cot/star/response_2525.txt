Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out all the possible 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get [9].
