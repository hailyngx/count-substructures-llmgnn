Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes for each 3-star in the graph. 
The nodes with degree 3 are potential central nodes for 3-stars. 
Here are the nodes with degree 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars with the central nodes listed above:
1. Central node 0:
   - <0, (2, 8, 8)>
2. Central node 2:
   - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
3. Central node 4:
   - <4, (3, 8, 9)>
4. Central node 5:
   - <5, (2, 9, 9)>
5. Central node 8:
   - <8, (0, 4, 7)>
   - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <8, (7, 0, 4)>
   - <8, (9, 4, 9)>
6. Central node 9:
   - <9, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <9, (5, 9, 8)>
   - <9, (8, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we have [10].
