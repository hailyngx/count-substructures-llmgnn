Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. 

Nodes with degree 3 are potential centers of 3-stars. In this graph, nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9 have degree 3. 

At node 1, 3, 8, or 9, we need to check if they are part of a 3-star. For each of these nodes, we need to check their neighboring nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

1. For node 1: (1, 2, 3) form a 3-star. 
2. For node 3: (3, 1, 8) form a 3-star.
3. For node 8: (8, 2, 3) form a 3-star.
4. For node 9: None of its neighbors form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3. 

So, the answer is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3)>
<3, (1, 8)>
<8, (2, 3)>
