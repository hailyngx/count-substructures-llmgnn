Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 5)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
