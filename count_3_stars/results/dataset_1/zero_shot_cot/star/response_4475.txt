Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars: [5].
