Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in a 3-star structure. 
We need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to 0, 2, 6)
- Node 2 (connected to 1, 6, 7)
- Node 4 (connected to 3, 6, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to 3, 6, 7)
- Node 6 (connected to 1, 2, 4, 5)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Number of 3-stars:
- From node 1: 1
- From node 2: 1
- From node 4: 1
- From node 5: 1
- From node 6: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4, 5)>
