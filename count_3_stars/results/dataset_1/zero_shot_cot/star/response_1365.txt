Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 7]
