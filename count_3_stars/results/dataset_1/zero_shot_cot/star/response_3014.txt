Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
2. <2, (3, 8, 9)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <5, (1, 0, 6)>
5. <8, (2, 3, 9)>
6. <9, (8, 2, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get [6].
