Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them, which would be the potential centers of the 3-star.

The nodes with three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Next, let's analyze each potential center to see if they form a 3-star structure.

- For node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- For node 1: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- For node 2: <2, (1, 5, 0)>
- For node 4: <4, (0, 6, 5)>
- For node 5: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- For node 6: <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- For node 7: <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- For node 8: <8, (6, 3, 7)>
- For node 9: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, we have identified all the unique 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 0)>, <4, (0, 6, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 8, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
