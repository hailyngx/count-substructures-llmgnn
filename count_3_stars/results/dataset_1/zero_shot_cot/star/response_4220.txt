Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to find all the 3-stars present:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, and 5.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, and 1.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
