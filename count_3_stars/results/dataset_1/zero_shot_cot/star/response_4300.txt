Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 
Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>

Counting all the identified 3-stars, we find a total of 9 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as [9].
