Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. 3-star centered at node 3: (3, 5, 6, 7)
2. 3-star centered at node 4: (4, 6, 5, 7)
3. 3-star centered at node 5: (5, 3, 6, 7)
4. 3-star centered at node 6: (6, 4, 5, 7)
5. 3-star centered at node 7: (7, 0, 4, 3)

Therefore, there are in total [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
   
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 3)>
