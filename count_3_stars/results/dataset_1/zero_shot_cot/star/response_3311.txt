Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes.

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

By definition, a 3-star has a center node and exactly three leaf nodes connected to the center. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Central node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 6, 9), (0, 8, 9)
- Central node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 8, 0)
- Central node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 3, 5)
- Central node 3: (3, 2, 5)
- Central node 4: (4, 7, 9)
- Central node 5: (5, 2, 3), (5, 8, 0)
- Central node 6: (6, 0, 9)
- Central node 7: (7, 4, 9)
- Central node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 5, 2), (8, 9, 0)
- Central node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 6, 0), (9, 7, 4), (9, 8, 0)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 0)>, <0, (6, 9, 0)>, <0, (8, 9, 0)>, <0, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 2, 8)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
