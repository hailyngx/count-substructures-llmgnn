Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are the centers of the 3-stars by checking which nodes have exactly 3 incident edges. These nodes are: 0, 4, 7, and 9.

Next, let's identify the leaves of each 3-star by looking at the nodes directly connected to the center node. 

For node 0, the leaves are 2 and 4. So, the 3-star is <0, (2, 4)>. 

For node 4, the leaves are 0 and 8. So, the 3-star is <4, (0, 8)>.

For node 7, the leaves are 2 and 9. So, the 3-star is <7, (2, 9)>.

For node 9, the leaves are 3 and 7. So, the 3-star is <9, (3, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
