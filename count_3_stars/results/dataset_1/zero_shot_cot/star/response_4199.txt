Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 7)
3. Node 7: (7, 1, 4)

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6), (3, 1)>
<1, (3, 7), (7, 4)>
<7, (1, 4), (1, 3)>
