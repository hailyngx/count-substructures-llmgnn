Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which can form 3-stars. 

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0, there is one possible 3-star: <0, (1, 4)>.
2. For node 2, there is one possible 3-star: <2, (5, 9)>.
3. For node 3, there is one possible 3-star: <3, (5, 7)>.
4. For node 5, there are two possible 3-stars: <5, (2, 3)> and <5, (7, 8)>
5. For node 7, there is one possible 3-star: <7, (3, 5)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4)>, <2, (5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3)>, <5, (7, 8)>, and <7, (3, 5)>.
