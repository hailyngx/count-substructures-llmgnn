Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
1. Identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

2. Since we are looking for 3-stars, focus on nodes with 3 neighbors.
- Node 0 is a central node with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6

3. Now, for each central node, check if they form a 3-star.
- For node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 6), (0, 5, 6), and (0, 6, 8) form 3-stars.

Based on this information, there are 4 unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 5, 6)>. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
