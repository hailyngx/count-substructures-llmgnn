Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. Before listing them out, let's first determine the center node of each 3-star.

From the given edges, the nodes and their connections can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars.

<0, (5, 9, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 1)>
<1, (3, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 4, 3)>
<3, (4, 7, 3)>
<3, (7, 1, 3)>
<4, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (8, 6, 4)>
<5, (0, 9, 5)>
<6, (4, 9, 6)>
<8, (4, 9, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
