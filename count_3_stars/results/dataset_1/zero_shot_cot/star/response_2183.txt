Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
