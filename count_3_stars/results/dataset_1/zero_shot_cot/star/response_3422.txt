Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
6. Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
7. Node 6: <6, (2, 3, 5)>
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 4)>
9. Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
10. Node 9: <9, (2)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
