Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes in a 3-star graph are the nodes with degree 3. In this graph, nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have a degree of 3.

Let's now identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
