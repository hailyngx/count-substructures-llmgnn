Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node with exactly three other nodes connected to it, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes with their corresponding connections:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 6
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 7
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 7
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 4
- Node 8: Connected to node 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[There are **5** 3-stars in the graph.]

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
