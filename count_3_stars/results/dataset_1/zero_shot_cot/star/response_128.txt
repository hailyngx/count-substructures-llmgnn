Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 9, 1)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 8 different 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
