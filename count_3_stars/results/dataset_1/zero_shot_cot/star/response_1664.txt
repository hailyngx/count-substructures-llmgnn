Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can see that the potential 3-star combinations could involve nodes with the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
