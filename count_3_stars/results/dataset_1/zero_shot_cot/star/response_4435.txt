Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, -)>

From the list above, we see that there are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
