Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 7, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
3. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <5, (2, 4, 5)>
5. <6, (3, 4, 9)>
6. <7, (0, 2, 4)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
