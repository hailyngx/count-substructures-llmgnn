Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star in the graph. 

For this graph, the central node and its adjacent nodes are as follows:
- Central node 0: Adjacent nodes 2, 8, 9
- Central node 1: Adjacent nodes 8, 9
- Central node 2: Adjacent nodes 0, 3, 7, 8
- Central node 3: Adjacent nodes 2, 5, 8
- Central node 4: Adjacent nodes 6, 8, 9
- Central node 5: Adjacent nodes 3, 9
- Central node 6: Adjacent nodes 4, 7
- Central node 7: Adjacent nodes 2, 6
- Central node 8: Adjacent nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Central node 9: Adjacent nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 8

Next, let's count the occurrences of each unique 3-star. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars and their count are as follows:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 9)>
- <6, (4, 7)>
- <7, (2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [9]
