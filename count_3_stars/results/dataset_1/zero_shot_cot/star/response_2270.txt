Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 1
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 6, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to Node 4
- Node 4 is connected to Node 2
- Node 5 is connected to Node 9
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 6 and 9
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 5, and 8

Now, let's list all the possible 3-stars in the graph: 
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
