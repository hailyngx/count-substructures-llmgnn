Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by finding 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
   - <0, (1, 3, 6)>
   
2. The possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center are:
   - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
   
3. The possible 3-stars with node 2 as the center are:
   - <2, (1, 4, 5)>
   
4. The possible 3-stars with node 3 as the center are:
   - <3, (0, 7, 0)>
   
5. The possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
   - <4, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <4, (2, 1, 8)>
   
6. The possible 3-stars with node 5 as the center are:
   - <5, (2, 2, 2)>
   
7. The possible 3-stars with node 6 as the center are:
   - <6, (0, 1, 1)>
   
8. The possible 3-stars with node 7 as the center are:
   - <7, (3, 4, 7)>
   
9. The possible 3-stars with node 8 as the center are:
   - <8, (4, 4, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
