Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's list all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (8)>
<8, (3, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
