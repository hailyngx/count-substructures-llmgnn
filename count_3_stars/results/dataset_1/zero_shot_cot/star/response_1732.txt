Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 is the central node in the following 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>.
- Node 1 is the central node in the following 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 6)>.
- Node 5 is the central node in the following 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 4)>.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
