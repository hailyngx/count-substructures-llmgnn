Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the 3-star structures. 

First, let's list down all the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 2, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-star structures in this graph:

<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (2, 9, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].  
So, the final answer is [6].
