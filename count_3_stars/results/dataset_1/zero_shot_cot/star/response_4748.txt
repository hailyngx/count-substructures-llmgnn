Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three leaves. 

Let's analyze the connections for each node:

- Node 0 is connected to 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to 2 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to 1 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to 0 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to 0.
- Node 6 is connected to 0 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to 2, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
