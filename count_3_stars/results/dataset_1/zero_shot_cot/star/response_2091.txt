Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars. 

Given the edges:
(0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7)

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

We can find the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3. Let's list the nodes that have degree 3: 
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 3

Node 9 is the only node with degree 3, so it can be the central node of a 3-star. Let's find the leaves of the stars connected to node 9:
- Node 4 is connected to node 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 9

Therefore, we have one 3-star with node 9 as the central node and nodes 4, 7 as the leaves. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <9, (4, 7)>.
