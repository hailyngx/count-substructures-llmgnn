Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the center nodes in the graph. The center nodes are the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. In this case, the nodes with three edges connected to them are nodes 0, 1, and 4. 

Next, for each center node, we will identify the leaves connected to it to form 3-stars. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
