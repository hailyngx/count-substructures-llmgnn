Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has exactly 3 edges connected to the center, we need to find nodes with a degree of 3. The central nodes in this graph are nodes 0, 5, and 7.

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

- For node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5)
- For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 8)
- For node 7: (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: <0, (3, 5)>
- For node 5: <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (7, 8)>, <5, (6, 8)>
- For node 7: <7, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The 3-stars are <0, (3, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (7, 8)>, and <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
