Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - Nodes 0, 1, and 5 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each node identified in step 1, find the unique 3-stars they are part of:
   - For node 0: (0, 2, 5, 7), (0, 5, 2, 8), (0, 7, 0, 1)
   - For node 1: (1, 3, 4, 7), (1, 7, 0, 1)
   - For node 5: (5, 0, 2, 8), (5, 2, 0, 7), (5, 8, 0, 5)
   
3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <0, (5, 2, 8)>
   - <0, (7, 0, 1)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 7)>
   - <1, (7, 0, 1)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <5, (2, 0, 7)>
   - <5, (8, 0, 5)>

Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8].
