Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 6, 7).
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 3, 4).
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 5, 6).
- Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes which is not 3, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes (3, 8, 9).
- Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 3, 8).
- Node 7 is connected to 2 nodes which is not 3, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 8 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 5, 8).

2. List down all unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
