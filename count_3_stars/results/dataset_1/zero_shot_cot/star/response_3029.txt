Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps we can follow to find all the 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, list the connected nodes to form 3-stars.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's start with step 1:

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 3, 8
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9 is connected to 3, 6

Next, we list the unique 3-stars based on the central node:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (3, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
