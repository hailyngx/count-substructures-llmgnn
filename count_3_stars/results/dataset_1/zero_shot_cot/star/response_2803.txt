Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6

Therefore, there are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
