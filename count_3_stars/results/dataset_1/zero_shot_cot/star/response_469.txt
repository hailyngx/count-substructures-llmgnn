Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 has 3 edges connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 has 5 edges connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 has 4 edges connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 has 6 edges connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, we can list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
