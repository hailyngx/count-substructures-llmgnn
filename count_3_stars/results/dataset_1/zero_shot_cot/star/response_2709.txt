Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 7, -)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <5, (4, 6, 8)>
6. <6, (4, 5, -)>
7. <7, (0, 2, -)>
8. <8, (5, -, -)>
9. <9, (2, -, -)>

Since there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars is [9].
