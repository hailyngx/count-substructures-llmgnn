Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph, which are the nodes with exactly three adjacent edges. 

From the given graph, the nodes that have three adjacent edges are nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph by considering each central node.
1. For central node 0:
    - <0, (1, 2, 9)>
2. For central node 6:
    - No 3-star as central node 6 has less than 3 adjacent edges.
3. For central node 7:
    - <7, (1, 3, 8)>
4. For central node 8:
    - <8, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
