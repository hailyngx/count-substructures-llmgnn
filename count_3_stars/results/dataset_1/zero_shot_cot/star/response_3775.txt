Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique combinations of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Let's list down all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
