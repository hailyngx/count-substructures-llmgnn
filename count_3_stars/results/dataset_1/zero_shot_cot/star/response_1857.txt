Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in such a way that they form a 3-star. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 9, -)>
<3, (2, -, -)>
<4, (7, -, -)>
<5, (1, 8, -)>
<6, (7, -, -)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, -, -)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [5] 
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
