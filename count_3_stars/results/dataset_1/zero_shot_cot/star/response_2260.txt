Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).
    - Node 3 is connected to 4, 6, and 7
    - Node 4 is connected to 1, 3, and 5
    - Node 5 is connected to 4 and 7
    - Node 7 is connected to 3 and 5

Step 2: From the identified nodes, construct 3-stars.

<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7)>
<7, (3, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
