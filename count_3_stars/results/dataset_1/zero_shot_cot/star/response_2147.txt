Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with 3 edges connected
    - Node 0 has 5 edges connected
    - Node 1 has 4 edges connected
    - Node 2 has 2 edges connected
    - Node 3 has 4 edges connected
    - Node 4 has 4 edges connected
    - Node 5 has 2 edges connected
    - Node 6 has 4 edges connected
    - Node 7 has 5 edges connected
    - Node 9 has 4 edges connected

Step 2: Find 3-stars
    - 3-star involving node 0: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    - 3-star involving node 1: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
    - 3-star involving node 4: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
    - 3-star involving node 6: <6, (0, 3, 4)>
    - 3-star involving node 9: <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars: [5]
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
