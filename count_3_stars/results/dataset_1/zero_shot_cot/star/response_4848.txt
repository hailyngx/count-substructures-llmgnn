Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

From the given edges, we can see that the central nodes along with their connected nodes are as follows:
- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Central node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 8.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7.
- Central node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 8.
- Central node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7.
- Central node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, 9.
- Central node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5.
- Central node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6.
- Central node 9 is connected to node 2, 6.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
