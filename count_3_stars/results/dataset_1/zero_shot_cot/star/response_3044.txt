Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms 2 unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 9)> and <0, (1, 5)>.
2. Node 1 does not form any 3-stars.
3. Node 2 forms 1 unique 3-star: <2, (4, 5)>.
4. Node 3 does not form any 3-stars.
5. Node 4 forms 4 unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 6)>, <4, (3, 7)>, <4, (5, 6)>, and <4, (5, 7)>.
6. Node 5 does not form any 3-stars.
7. Node 6 forms 2 unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 4)> and <6, (7, 9)>.
8. Node 7 forms 1 unique 3-star: <7, (3, 4)>.
9. Node 8 does not form any 3-stars.
10. Node 9 forms 2 unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 6)> and <9, (8, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (5, 9)>, <0, (1, 5)>, <2, (4, 5)>, <4, (2, 6)>, <4, (3, 7)>, <4, (5, 6)>, <4, (5, 7)>, <6, (2, 4)>, <6, (7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4)>, <9, (0, 6)>, <9, (8, 6)>.
