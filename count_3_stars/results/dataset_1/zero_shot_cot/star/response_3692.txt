Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. The nodes that satisfy this condition will act as the central node of a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <0, (5, 7, 9)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 8)>
4. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <8, (1, 7, 9)>
7. <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Since there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the count of 3-stars is [7].
