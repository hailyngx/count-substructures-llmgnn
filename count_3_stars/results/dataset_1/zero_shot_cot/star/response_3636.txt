Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes each. Therefore, these nodes can serve as the centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph gives us a total of [4].
