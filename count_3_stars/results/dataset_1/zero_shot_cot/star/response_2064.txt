Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them based on their degree in the graph. In this case, the central nodes are 0, 3, 7, and 5. 

Next, we need to identify the leaves connected to each central node to form the 3-stars. 

For central node 0:
Leaves: 1, 4, 5, 7
Possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>

For central node 3:
Leaves: 4, 6, 8
Possible 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 8)>

For central node 7:
Leaves: 2, 4, 5, 9
Possible 3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>

For central node 5:
Leaves: 0, 2, 7, 9
Possible 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
