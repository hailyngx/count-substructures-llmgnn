Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
