Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
    - Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 6)
    - Node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 5), (1, 3, 5)
    - Node 4: (4, 0, 7), (4, 0, 9)
    - Node 6: (6, 0, 7), (6, 3, 7), (6, 7, 8), (6, 7, 9)
    - Node 9: (9, 2, 4), (9, 4, 6), (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 8)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 10 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
