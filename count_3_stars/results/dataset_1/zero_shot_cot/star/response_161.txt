Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8.

To count the number of 3-stars, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Nodes that satisfy this condition are 0, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
