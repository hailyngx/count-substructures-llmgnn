Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
