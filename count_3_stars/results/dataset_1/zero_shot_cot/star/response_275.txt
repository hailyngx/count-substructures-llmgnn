Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can iterate through each node and check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, here is the breakdown of the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9. <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9. <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 8. <3, (0, 4, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9. <4, (3, 8, 9)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9. <7, (1, 8, 9)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4. <8, (0, 3, 4)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 1. <9, (0, 6, 1)>

Therefore, total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
