Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with degree 3.  
Nodes with degree 3: 0, 6, 7  

Step 2: For each node found in Step 1, identify its adjacent nodes.  
For node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8  
For node 6: 3, 4, 7, 9  
For node 7: 2, 3, 6  

Step 3: Form 3-stars with the identified nodes.  
<0, (2, 4, 8)>  
<6, (3, 4, 9)>  
<7, (2, 3, 6)>  

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars.  
[3]

Therefore, the answer is [3].
