Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes in the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes:

1. Node 0: Does not form a 3-star.
2. Node 1: Forms a 3-star with (0, 3, 5).
3. Node 2: Forms a 3-star with (3, 6, 7).
4. Node 3: Forms two 3-stars with (0, 2, 5) and (1, 2, 8).
5. Node 4: Does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 5: Forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 7).
7. Node 6: Forms a 3-star with (2, 4, 9).
8. Node 7: Forms a 3-star with (2, 5, 3).
9. Node 8: Forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 9).
10. Node 9: Forms a 3-star with (6, 8, 2).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:

<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
