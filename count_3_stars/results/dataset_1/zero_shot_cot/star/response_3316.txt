Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7.
  This forms a 3-star with center 0 and leaves 1, 5, and 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
  This forms a 3-star with center 1 and leaves 0, 5, and 6: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
  This forms a 3-star with center 3 and leaves 5, 6, and 7: <3, (5, 6, 7)>

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
  This forms a 3-star with center 4 and leaves 5, 6, and 8: <4, (5, 6, 8)>

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
  This forms two 3-stars:
    1. <7, (0, 5, 6)>
    2. <7, (3, 5, 6)>

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9.
  This forms a 3-star with center 8 and leaves 6, 7, and 9: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
