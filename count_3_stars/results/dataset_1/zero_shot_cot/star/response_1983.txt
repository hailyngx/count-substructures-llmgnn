Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first list down all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (7, 9, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[10]
