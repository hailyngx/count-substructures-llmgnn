Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

If we look at each node in the graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
- Total number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
