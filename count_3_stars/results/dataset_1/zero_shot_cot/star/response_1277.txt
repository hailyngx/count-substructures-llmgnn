Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars by identifying the central node and its connected nodes in each case. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 9, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars from above: [5]
