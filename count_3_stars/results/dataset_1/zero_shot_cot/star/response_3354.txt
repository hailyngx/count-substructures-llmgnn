Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9 (3-star 1).
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6 (3-star 2).
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 9 (3-star 3).
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2 (3-star 4).
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8 (3-star 5).
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 5 (3-star 6).
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5 (3-star 7).
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5 (3-star 8).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
 <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>.
    
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
