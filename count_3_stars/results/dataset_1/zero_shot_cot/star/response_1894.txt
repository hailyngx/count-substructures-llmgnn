Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
2. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <9, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <9, (1, 7, 4)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
