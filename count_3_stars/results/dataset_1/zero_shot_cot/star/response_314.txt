Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9:
   <0, (5, 7, 8)>
   <0, (5, 7, 9)>
   <0, (5, 8, 9)>
   <0, (7, 8, 9)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
   <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   <2, (4, 5, 9)>
   <2, (4, 6, 7)>
   <2, (4, 7, 9)>
   <2, (5, 6, 7)>
   <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   <2, (5, 6, 9)>
   <2, (5, 7, 8)>
   <2, (5, 7, 9)>
   <2, (5, 8, 9)>
   <2, (6, 7, 8)>
   <2, (6, 7, 9)>
   <2, (6, 8, 9)>
   <2, (7, 8, 9)>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9:
   No 3-star involving node 3 can be formed.

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6:
   No 3-star involving node 4 can be formed.

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7:
   No new 3-stars involving node 5.

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7:
   <6, (1, 2, 4)>
   <6, (1, 2, 7)>
   <6, (1, 4, 7)>
   <6, (2, 4, 7)>

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9:
   No new 3-stars involving node 7.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9:
   No new 3-stars involving node 8.

9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8:
   No new 3-stars involving node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
