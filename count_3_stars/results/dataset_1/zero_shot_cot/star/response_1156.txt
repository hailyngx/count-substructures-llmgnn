Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Firstly, let's identify the central nodes in the given graph. The central nodes are the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 3, and 8 are central nodes since they have three edges each connected to them. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on these central nodes. 

1. For node 0:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 1, 8)>
<0, (3, 1, 9)>
<0, (8, 1, 3)>
<0, (8, 1, 7)>
<0, (9, 0, 6)>

2. For node 3:
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 7)>
<3, (8, 0, 1)>
<3, (8, 7, 1)>
<3, (9, 0, 1)>
<3, (9, 0, 6)>
<3, (4, 3, 7)>

3. For node 8:
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 3)>
<8, (1, 0, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (7, 0, 3)>
<8, (7, 1, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [21] 3-stars in the given graph.
