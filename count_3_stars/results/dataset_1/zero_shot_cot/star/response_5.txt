Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. These are nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Nodes with three edges:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 5
- Node 6

Now, let's construct the 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 1, 4, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 2, 6, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 2), (6, 3, 5)

Therefore, there are four unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (3, 5)> 

There are [5] 3-stars in total.
