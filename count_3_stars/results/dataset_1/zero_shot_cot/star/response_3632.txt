Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the potential 3-star configurations in the graph:
1. Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 2)
2. Node 1: (1, 6, 9), (1, 9, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 4, 0), (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 4), (2, 9, 0), (2, 9, 5)
4. Node 3: (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 4), (3, 6, 1), (3, 6, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 2, 0), (4, 3, 8), (4, 8, 3)
6. Node 5: (5, 2, 3), (5, 3, 2)
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 9), (6, 3, 9)
8. Node 8: (8, 4, 9), (8, 9, 4), (8, 7, 9), (8, 9, 7)
9. Node 9: (9, 1, 6), (9, 1, 2), (9, 2, 1), (9, 6, 1), (9, 6, 3), (9, 8, 4), (9, 8, 6), (9, 8, 4)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star configurations in the graph:
Total number of 3-star configurations = 2 (Node 0) + 2 (Node 1) + 6 (Node 2) + 2 (Node 3) + 2 (Node 4) + 2 (Node 5) + 2 (Node 6) + 4 (Node 8) + 8 (Node 9) = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 0)>
<2, (0, 5, 4)>
<2, (5, 4, 0)>
<2, (9, 0, 5)>
<2, (9, 5, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 3)>
<3, (5, 4, 3)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 0, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 4)>
<4, (8, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 9, 6)>
<6, (3, 9, 6)>
<8, (4, 9, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 9, 6)>
<9, (6, 1, 9)>
<9, (6, 3, 9)>
<9, (8, 4, 9)>
<9, (8, 6, 9)>
