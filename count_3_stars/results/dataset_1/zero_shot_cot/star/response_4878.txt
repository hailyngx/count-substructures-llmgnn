Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 2, and 4 have three edges each, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Next, let's determine the leaves of each 3-star. We will look at each potential central node and find the nodes connected to it.

For node 1:
- (1, 2)
- (1, 4)
- (1, 6)

Therefore, the 3-star with node 1 as the center has leaves 2, 4, and 6.
<1, (2, 4, 6)>

For node 2:
- (2, 1)
- (2, 7)
- (2, 8)
- (2, 9)

Therefore, the 3-star with node 2 as the center has leaves 1, 7, 8, and 9.
<2, (1, 7, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
- (4, 0)
- (4, 1)
- (4, 8)
- (4, 9)

Therefore, the 3-star with node 4 as the center has leaves 0, 1, 8, and 9.
<4, (0, 1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
