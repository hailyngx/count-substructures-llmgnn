Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has 5 edges.
- Node 1 has 5 edges.
- Node 4 has 5 edges.
- Node 5 has 5 edges.
- Node 6 has 4 edges.
- Node 9 has 5 edges.

2. Based on the above information, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 9 have 3 edges connected to them and are potential central nodes of 3-stars.

3. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>

4. Counting the total number of 3-stars found, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
