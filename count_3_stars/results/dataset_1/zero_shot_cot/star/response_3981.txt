Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
First, let's list out the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: (6, 9)
- Node 1: (4, 9)
- Node 2: (6, 7)
- Node 3: (6, 9)
- Node 4: (1, 7)
- Node 7: (2, 4, 9)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (4, 9)>
<2, (6, 7)>
<3, (6, 9)>
<4, (1, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>

There are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
