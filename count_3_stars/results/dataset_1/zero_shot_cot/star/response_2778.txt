Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. It must be a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Looking at the edges provided, node 2 and node 8 satisfy this condition. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. For center node 2:
   - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <2, (5, 7, 6)>
   - <2, (6, 4, 8)>
  
2. For center node 8:
   - <8, (2, 4, 3)>
   - <8, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <8, (4, 6, 2)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 0)>
   - <8, (4, 0, 6)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
