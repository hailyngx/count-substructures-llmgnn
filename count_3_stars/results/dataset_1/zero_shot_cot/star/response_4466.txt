Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8 are central nodes. 

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph based on these central nodes:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

In total, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
