Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes while satisfying the definition of a 3-star graph.

Here are the steps to find all 3-stars in the graph:
1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
2. Confirm if these nodes form a 3-star graph.

Let's start by listing the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1 and 8

Now, let's check if any of these nodes form a 3-star:
- Node 1: (1, 2, 4, 5) forms a 3-star.
- Node 2: (2, 1, 7, 9) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
