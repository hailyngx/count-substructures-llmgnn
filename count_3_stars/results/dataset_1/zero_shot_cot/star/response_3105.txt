Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the adjacency list of the graph, we can start by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<[2, (3, 4, 6)]>
<[5, (1, 4, 7)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
