Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 have degree 2, which means they can be central nodes of a 3-star.

Step 2: For each central node, identify the connected nodes:
1. For node 0: (0, 5), (0, 8)
   <0, (5, 8)>
   
2. For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6)
   <1, (2, 3, 6)>
   
3. For node 2: (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)
   <2, (1, 6, 7)>
   
4. For node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9)
   <3, (1, 5, 6)>
   
5. For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9)
   <5, (0, 3, 8)>
   
6. For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   <8, (0, 2, 5)>
   
Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars:
- By counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
