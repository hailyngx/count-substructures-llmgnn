Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1:
   - (1, 3), (1, 9)
   <1, (3, 9)>

2. Node 2:
   - (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6)
   <2, (3, 5, 6)>

3. Node 3:
   - (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8)
   <3, (1, 2, 4, 5), (1, 2, 5, 8)>

4. Node 4:
   - (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8)
   <4, (3, 5, 8)>

5. Node 5:
   - (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9)
   <5, (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 9)>

6. Node 6:
   - (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8)
   <6, (2, 7, 8)>

7. Node 7:
   - No 3-star configuration.

8. Node 8:
   - (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6)
   <8, (3, 4, 6)>

9. Node 9:
   - (9, 1), (9, 5)
   <9, (1, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
