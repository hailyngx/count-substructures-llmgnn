Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 edges) in the graph. These central nodes will be part of the 3-stars in the graph.

The central nodes in the given graph are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 4, 7, 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 6)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 8, 9)

Next, we form the 3-stars using each central node and its connected nodes:
- From central node 0:
    - <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- From central node 1:
    - <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- From central node 3:
    - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- From central node 6:
    - <6, (1, 8, 9)>

Counting the total unique 3-stars, we find:
[4]
