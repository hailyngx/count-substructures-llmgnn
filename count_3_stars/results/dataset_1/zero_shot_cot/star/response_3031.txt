Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 7, 8)>
3. Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 6: <6, (8, 9, 7)>
5. Node 8: <8, (1, 6, 9)>
6. Node 9: <9, (6, 7, 8)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [6].
