Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is not a part of any 3-star since it is only connected to one other node.

2. Node 1 is not a part of any 3-star since it is only connected to one other node.

3. Node 2 is connected to three other nodes: 4, 8, and 9. This forms the first 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 9)>.

4. Node 3 is not a part of any 3-star since it is only connected to one other node.

5. Node 4 is connected to four other nodes: 0, 2, 7, and 8. This forms the second 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 8)>.

6. Node 5 is connected to three other nodes: 1, 3, and 6. This forms the third 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 6)>.

7. Node 6 is connected to three other nodes: 5, 7, and 9. This forms the fourth 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 9)>.

8. Nodes 7, 8, and 9 are not part of any 3-star since they are not connected to three other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
