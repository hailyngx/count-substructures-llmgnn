Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it in a star pattern. 

Let's analyze the graph based on the given edges:

1. Nodes with their adjacent nodes:
   - Node 0: 7, 9
   - Node 1: 5, 7, 8, 9
   - Node 3: 5, 6, 8
   - Node 4: 5, 7
   - Node 5: 1, 3, 4
   - Node 6: 3
   - Node 7: 0, 1, 4
   - Node 8: 1, 3, 9
   - Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. For Node 0: (0, 7, 9)
2. For Node 1: (1, 5, 7), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9)
3. For Node 3: (3, 5, 8)
4. For Node 4: (4, 5, 7)
5. For Node 5: (5, 1, 3), (5, 1, 4)
6. For Node 8: (8, 1, 9)

Count: 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7)>, <1, (7, 9)>, <1, (8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7)>
