Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes.
    - Node 0 has 5 adjacent nodes, which is not valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 1 has 5 adjacent nodes, which is not valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 2 has 2 adjacent nodes, which is not valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 3 has 3 adjacent nodes, which is valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 4 has 3 adjacent nodes, which is valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 5 has 2 adjacent nodes, which is not valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 6 has 3 adjacent nodes, which is valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 7 has 2 adjacent nodes, which is not valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 8 has 3 adjacent nodes, which is valid for a 3-star.
    - Node 9 has 4 adjacent nodes, which is not valid for a 3-star.

Step 2: List the 3-stars with valid central nodes:
    - <3, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    - <6, (2, 3, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars found.
    - Total number of 3-stars: 3
