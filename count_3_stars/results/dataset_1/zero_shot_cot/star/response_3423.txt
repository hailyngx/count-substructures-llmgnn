Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes but these three nodes are not directly connected to each other. These sets represent 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
