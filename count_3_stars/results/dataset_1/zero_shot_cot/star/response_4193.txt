Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.

Next, let's list down all possible 3-stars with the identified central nodes:
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
