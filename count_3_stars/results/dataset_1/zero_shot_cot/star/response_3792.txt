Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {3, 4}
- Node 6: {4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {1, 6}

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars
- Iterate through each node and check if it forms a 3-star
- Count the total number of 3-stars

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars
- Each unique 3-star should appear only once in the final list
- Arrive at the final count and list of unique 3-stars
