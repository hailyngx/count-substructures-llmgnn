Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 9, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (1)>
<5, (3, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (9)>
<8, (9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars listed above and put the count inside brackets:

[9]
