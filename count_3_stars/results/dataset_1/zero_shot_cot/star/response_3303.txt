Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which could be potential central nodes of 3-stars:
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 1, and 6.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- 3-star with central node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- 3-star with central node 8: <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- 3-star with central node 1: <1, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
