Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph and count the number of 3-stars.

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
