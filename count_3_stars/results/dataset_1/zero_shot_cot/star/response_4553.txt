Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the graph. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three leaf nodes. Let's find all possible 3-stars in the given graph:

- Possible 3-star structures:
    1. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7)
    2. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 1)
    3. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 6)
    4. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 9)
    5. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 8)
    6. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 8)
    7. Node 7: (7, 1)
    8. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6)
    9. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found.
The total number of 3-stars is [9].
    
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 1)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 5)>
<7, (1)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
