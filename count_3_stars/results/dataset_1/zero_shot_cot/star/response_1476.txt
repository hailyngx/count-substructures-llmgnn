Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with their adjacent nodes:

Node 0: {4, 7, 9}
Node 1: {4, 7}
Node 2: {7}
Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: {8}
Node 6: {4, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4}
Node 8: {4, 5}
Node 9: {0, 6}

Now we will list the 3-stars present in the graph. 

The 3-star structures are as follows:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, -)>
<2, (7, -, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, the final output is [8].
