Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:
- 10 nodes
- 28 edges

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[Total number of 3-stars: [10]]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 0)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (9, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
