Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

1. Node 0:
    - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
  
2. Node 1:
    - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
  
3. Node 2:
    - No 3-star as the node does not have exactly 3 edges.
  
4. Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
  
5. Node 4:
    - No 3-star as the node does not have exactly 3 edges.
  
6. Node 5:
    - <5, (0, 1, 3)>
  
7. Node 6:
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
  
8. Node 7:
    - <7, (1, 3, 5)>
  
9. Node 8:
    - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
  
10. Node 9:
    - <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
