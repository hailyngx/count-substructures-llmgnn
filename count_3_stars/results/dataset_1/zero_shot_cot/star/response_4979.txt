Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node has exactly 3 edges connected to it, and those edges form a 3-star pattern. 

Given the information about the edges, node 0 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 7, 8, 9), node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 9), node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5), node 3 has 2 neighbors (8, 9), node 4 has 2 neighbors (2, 8), node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9), node 6 has 2 neighbors (1, 5), node 7 has 1 neighbor (0), node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8), and node 9 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 5, 9).

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
