Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. 

Let's denote the nodes by their numbers: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

After carefully examining the graph and the edges provided, we can find the following unique 3-star patterns:
    <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    <1, (0, 2, 5)>
    <2, (1, 4, 7)>
    <3, (5, 8, 9)>
    <4, (2, 7, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we can see that there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
