Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, we identify the central nodes along with their connected nodes:

1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 3, 4)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <9, (1, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
