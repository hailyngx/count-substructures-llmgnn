Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three incident edges. Based on the given edges, the central nodes are nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 8. 

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:
- Central node 0: Leaves {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Central node 4: Leaves {0, 6, 8}
- Central node 6: Leaves {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Central node 7: Leaves {0, 5, 6}
- Central node 8: Leaves {4, 6, 9}

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
