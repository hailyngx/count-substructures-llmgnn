Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graph is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 
Given the edges in the graph, let's find all the 3-stars present:

1. Starting from node 0, we don't have any 3-star as there is only one edge for node 0.
2. For node 1, there is a potential 3-star with (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8). This is a 3-star <1, (4, 7, 8)>.
3. Node 3 has multiple potential 3-stars: 
   - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <3, (7, 8, 5)>
   - <3, (6, 4, 5)>
4. For node 4, we have a 3-star <4, (1, 5, 6)>.
5. Node 5 has a few potential 3-stars:
   - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
   - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (4, 6, 3)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (3, 4, 5)>.
7. Node 7 contributes to a 3-star <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
8. Finally, node 8 is part of a 3-star <8, (1, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8], and they are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>, <3, (6, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 3)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>
