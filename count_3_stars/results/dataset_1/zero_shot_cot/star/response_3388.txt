Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list down the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 1

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 4)> and <6, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
