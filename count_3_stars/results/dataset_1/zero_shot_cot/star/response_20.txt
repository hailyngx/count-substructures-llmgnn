Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 6, 6)>
<3, (4, 9, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
