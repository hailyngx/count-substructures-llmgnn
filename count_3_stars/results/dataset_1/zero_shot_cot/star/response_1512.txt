Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. The 3-stars can be formed by selecting a central node and its three connected nodes. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
