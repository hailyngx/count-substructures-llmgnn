Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
Node 0: 4, 5, 6
Node 1: 8
Node 2: 3, 5, 9
Node 3: 2, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 5
Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 6: 0, 5, 9
Node 7: 3, 8
Node 8: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 5, 6, 8

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
