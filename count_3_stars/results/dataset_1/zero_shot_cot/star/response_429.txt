Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star shape. 

Following are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (2, 8, -)>  
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, -)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
