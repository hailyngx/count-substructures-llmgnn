Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node and its neighbors. Then we check if these nodes form a 3-star. 

The central nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. We will now examine each of these central nodes to count the 3-stars:

For node 0: 
- Neighbors: 5, 6, 9
- 3-Star: <0, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 2, 5, 8
- 3-Star: <3, (2, 5, 8)>

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 2, 5, 6
- 3-Star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- 3-Stars: <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7
- 3-Star: <6, (0, 4, 7)>

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 9
- 3-Star: <8, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
- 3-Star: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-Stars: [8]
Unique 3-Stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>
