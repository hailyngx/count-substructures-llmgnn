Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6: <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5: <8, (0, 3, 5)>
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 0: <9, (2, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
