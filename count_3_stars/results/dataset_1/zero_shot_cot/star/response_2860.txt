Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

In this graph, the following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 9)

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
