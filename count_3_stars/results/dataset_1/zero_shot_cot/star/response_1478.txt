Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's first list all the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- 3, 4, 6, 7, 9

Now, let's check the neighbors of each of these nodes:
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

From the analysis above, we can see that the nodes forming 3-star patterns are as follows:
1. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
2. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
3. <7, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
