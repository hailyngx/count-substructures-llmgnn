Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Now, counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[6]
