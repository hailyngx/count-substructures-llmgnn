Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 3)>
4. <3, (4, 9, 2)>
5. <4, (3, 9, 2)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
8. <7, (1, 9, 6)>
9. <8, (5, 9, 2)>
10. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [10].
