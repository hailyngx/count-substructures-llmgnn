Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
