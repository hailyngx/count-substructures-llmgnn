Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph information, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8, making a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9, making a 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9, making a 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 9)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7, making a 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 7)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9, making a 3-star: <7, (2, 5, 9)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4, making a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
