Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (6, 8, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
