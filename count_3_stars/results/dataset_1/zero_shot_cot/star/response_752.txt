Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections in the given graph.
The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 7)>
3. <3, (6, 8, 9)>
4. <6, (3, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
