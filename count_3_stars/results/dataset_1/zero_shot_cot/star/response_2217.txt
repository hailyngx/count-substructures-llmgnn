Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes of each 3-star and then find the corresponding leaves connected to them. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
