Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (4, 8, -)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 8, -)>
<4, (0, 5, -)>
<6, (1, 2, -)>
<7, (1, 9, -)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
