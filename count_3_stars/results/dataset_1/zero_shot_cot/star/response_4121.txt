Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes and their neighboring nodes. Based on the given edges, we have the following information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
Start by looking at each node's connections to form the 3-stars.

[Total number of 3-stars: 3]

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
