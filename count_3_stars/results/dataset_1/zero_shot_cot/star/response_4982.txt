Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5
   - <1, (5, _ , _ )>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4
   - <2, (4, _ , _ )>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
   - <3, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <3, (5, 4, 6)>
   - <3, (6, 4, 5)>

4. Node 7 is connected to node 9
   - <7, (9, _, _ )>

5. Node 8 is connected to node 9
   - <8, (9, _, _ )>

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8
   - <9, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <9, (4, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (6, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (6, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <9, (7, 4, 6)>
   - <9, (7, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (7, 6, 8)>
   - <9, (8, 4, 6)>
   - <9, (8, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (8, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [11]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (5, _ , _ )>, <2, (4, _ , _ )>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (6, 4, 5)>, <7, (9, _, _ )>, <8, (9, _, _ )>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>.
