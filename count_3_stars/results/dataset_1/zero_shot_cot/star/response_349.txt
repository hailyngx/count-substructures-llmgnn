Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node in the graph:

0: 8
1: 5, 6
2: 4
3: 8
4: 2, 5, 6
5: 1, 4, 6
6: 1, 4, 5, 8
8: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

We have the following 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<4, (5, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>

Thus, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
