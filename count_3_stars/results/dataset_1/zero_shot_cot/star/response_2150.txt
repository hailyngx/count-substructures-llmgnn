Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which form a 3-star configuration. Let's go step-by-step by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph.

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 7), (0 is the center)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1 is the center)
3. Node 6: (6, 8, 9), (6 is the center)
  
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 7)>
<1, (0, 7)>
<6, (8, 9)>
