Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We observe that the number of edges is not sufficient to form any 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. (1, 7, 1, 7) - This is not a 3-star as the central node is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Hence, there are no 3-star graphs in the given graph, so the final answer is [] (zero 3-stars).
