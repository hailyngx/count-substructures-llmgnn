Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 3, 8), (0, 4, 8), (0, 8, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 9), (2, 5, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 5)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 8), (4, 8, 9)
6. Node 5: (5, 2, 3), (5, 2, 7), (5, 3, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 9, x) (Incomplete 3-star)
8. Node 7: (7, 4, 5)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 4), (8, 0, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 6), (9, 1, 2), (9, 6, x) (Incomplete 3-star)

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 9)>, <2, (1, 9)>, <2, (5, 9)>, <3, (0, 5)>, <4, (0, 8)>, <4, (8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3)>, <5, (2, 7)>, <5, (3, 7)>, <6, (9, x)>, <7, (4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4)>, <8, (0, 9)>, <9, (0, 1)>, <9, (0, 2)>, <9, (0, 6)>, <9, (1, 2)>, <9, (6, x)> 

Count of 3-stars: [19]
