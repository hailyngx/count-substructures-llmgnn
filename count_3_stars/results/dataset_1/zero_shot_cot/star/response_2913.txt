Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 7)>
<4, (5, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
