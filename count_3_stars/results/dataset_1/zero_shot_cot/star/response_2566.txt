Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (8, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<(2, 3, 5), 4>
<(3, 5, 6), 9>
<(4, 5, 6), 9>
<(5, 6, 9), 4>
<7, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (0, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars by counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above.
