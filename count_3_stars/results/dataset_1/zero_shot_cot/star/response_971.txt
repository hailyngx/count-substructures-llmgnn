Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes. These nodes will form the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [4].
