Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

We can see that nodes {2, 3, 5, 7} have a degree of 3, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's examine each of these nodes:

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star centered at node 2. <2, (3, 5, 7)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. It does not form a 3-star as it is missing one connection to create a 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6. It does not form a 3-star as it is missing one connection to create a 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to node 2. It does not form a 3-star as it is missing two connections to create a 3-star.

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in the given graph: <2, (3, 5, 7)>.

Thus, the final answer is [1].
