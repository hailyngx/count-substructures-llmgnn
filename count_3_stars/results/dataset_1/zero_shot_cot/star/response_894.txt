Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 4, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 4)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (7, 4, 1)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (8, 2, 5)>
<4, (8, 2, 7)>
<4, (8, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 2, 0)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 1)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

So, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
