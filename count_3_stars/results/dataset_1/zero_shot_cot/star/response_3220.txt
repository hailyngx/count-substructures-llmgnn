Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
   
    - Central node 0:
        - Nodes connected to 0: 1, 6, 9
            <0, (1, 6, 9)>
    
    - Central node 1:
        - Nodes connected to 1: 0, 5, 6, 8
            <1, (0, 5, 6)>
    
    - Central node 6:
        - Nodes connected to 6: 0, 1, 3, 8
            <6, (0, 1, 3)>

    - Central node 7: No 3-star can be formed with node 7.
    
    - Central nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9: No 3-star can be formed with these central nodes.
   
Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
