Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes could potentially serve as the center of a 3-star.

2. For each of these potential center nodes, count how many unique 3-stars can be formed using that node as the center and its three neighbors as leaves.

Let's start:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 9}
   - Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8}
   - Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 8}

2. Unique 3-stars:
   <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   <0, (1, 3, 9)>
   <3, (0, 6, 8)>
   <9, (0, 1, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get: [4]
