Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify the central node in each 3-star configuration. A central node in a 3-star must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges:
- Node 0 is connected to 5 and 7
- Node 1 is connected to 2 and 5
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 5, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to 5 and 6
- Node 4 is connected to 5, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6 is connected to 2, 3, and 5
- Node 7 is connected to 0
- Node 8 is connected to 4
- Node 9 is connected to 4

Following the connections, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 7), (5, 1, 2)>
<1, (5, 0), (5, 2, 6)>
<2, (5, 1), (5, 0, 3)>
<3, (5, 4), (5, 2, 6)>
<4, (5, 8), (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (5, 2), (5, 3, 1)>
<8, (5, 4), (5, 9, 0)>
<9, (5, 4), (5, 8, 0)>

There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
