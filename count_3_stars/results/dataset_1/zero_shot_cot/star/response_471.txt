Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 5, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 1, 1)>

Output: [8]
