Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 9)  -> <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3)  -> <1, (0, 3, 9)>
3. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 9)  -> <3, (1, 9, 7)>
4. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)  -> <4, (0, 6, 7)>
5. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)  -> <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
