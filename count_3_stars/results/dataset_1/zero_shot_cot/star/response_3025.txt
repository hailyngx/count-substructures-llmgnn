Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-star graphs:

1. Central node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6) -> <1, (4, 5, 6)>
2. Central node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6) -> <3, (4, 5, 6)>
3. Central node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8) -> <4, (1, 3, 8)>
4. Central node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7) -> <5, (1, 3, 7)>
5. Central node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3) -> <6, (1, 3, *)> (Note: Only two leaves)

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [5].
