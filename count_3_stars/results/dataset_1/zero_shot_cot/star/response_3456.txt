Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 1, 3, 6, 8, 9

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
For each node identified in Step 1, we will find all unique 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Number of 3-stars:
1. Node 1: 2
2. Node 3: 1
3. Node 6: 3
4. Node 8: 2
5. Node 9: 2

Total number of 3-stars: 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 8)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 3)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 8)>
