Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the central node by exactly three edges, forming a 3-star pattern.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 3)>
- <8, (0, 3)>
- <9, (0, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
