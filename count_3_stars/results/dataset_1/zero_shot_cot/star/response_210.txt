Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. 

Let's first list out all the 3-stars by considering each node as the central node:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
