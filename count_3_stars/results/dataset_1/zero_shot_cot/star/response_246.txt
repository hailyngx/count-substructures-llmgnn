Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with the given node at the center. Let's identify these 3-stars:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, -)>
<4, (3, 6, -)>

Since each 3-star is unique, we have found a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
