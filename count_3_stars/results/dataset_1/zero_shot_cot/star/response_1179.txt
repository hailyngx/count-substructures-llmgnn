Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.

To count the number of 3-stars, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them (3 leaves) connected by a single central node.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>

Count: [7]
