Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We'll list them below:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, -)>
<3, (2, 6, -)>
<4, (8, -, -)>
<5, (7, 8, -)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[9]
