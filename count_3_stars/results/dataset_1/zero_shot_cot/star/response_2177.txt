Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
3. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
5. <2, (7, 8, 9)>
6. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
7. <7, (0, 2, 6)>
8. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
9. <7, (2, 6, 8)>
10. <8, (0, 2, 6)>
11. <8, (0, 2, 9)>
12. <8, (0, 6, 9)>
13. <8, (2, 6, 9)>
14. <9, (2, 8, 3)>
15. <9, (2, 8, 9)>
16. <9, (3, 8, 9)>
17. <9, (3, 2, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [17].
