Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the subsets of 4 nodes arranged in Star configuration with one node as the center, and the other three nodes connected to the center node.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>  
<1, (7, 9, 1)>
<2, (7, 8, 7)>
<3, (4, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (4, 8, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
