Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 4, 6, and 7. So, the possible 3-stars with center at node 0 are:
   <0, (4, 6, 7)>

2. Node 1 has edges with nodes 3, 6, and 8. So, the possible 3-stars with center at node 1 are:
   <1, (3, 6, 8)>

3. Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9. So, the possible 3-stars with center at node 3 are:
   <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   <3, (1, 4, 9)>

4. Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 3, and 8. So, the possible 3-stars with center at node 4 are:
   <4, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>.
