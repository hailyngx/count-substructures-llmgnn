Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].  
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
