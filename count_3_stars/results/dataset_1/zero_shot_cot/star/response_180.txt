Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify those 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <2, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only one other node (0).
4. Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to two other nodes (2 and 9).
5. Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to two other nodes (0 and 7).
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8: <6, (2, 7, 8)>
7. Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes (5 and 6).
8. Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only two other nodes (0 and 6).
9. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to two other nodes (1 and 4).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars identified are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, and <6, (2, 7, 8)>.
