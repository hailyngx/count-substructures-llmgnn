Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, let's first look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:  
- Node 5: (0, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 6: (0, 5)
- Node 8: (2, 5, 9)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (5, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (7, 8, 9)>
3. <5, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <6, (0, 5)>
5. <8, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
