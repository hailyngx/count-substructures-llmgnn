Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We can determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the graph with node 0 to 9, the 3-stars are formed by having one central node and three leaf nodes attached to it. 

Let's count the 3-stars in this graph step by step: 

1. For node 0:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
  
2. For node 1:
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
  
3. For node 2:
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
  
4. For node 3:
- No 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes (6 and 8).
  
5. For node 5:
- No 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes (2 and 9).
  
6. For node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 0, 3)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (3, 0, 1)>
- <6, (3, 1, 8)>
  
7. For node 7:
- <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- <7, (0, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 0, 8)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 0, 2)>
- <7, (8, 2, 9)>
  
8. For node 8:
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 2, 6)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (6, 2, 7)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 2, 9)>
- <8, (7, 3, 9)>
  
9. For node 9:
- No 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes (5 and 7).
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 2, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 2, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 2, 9)>, <8, (7, 3, 9)>
