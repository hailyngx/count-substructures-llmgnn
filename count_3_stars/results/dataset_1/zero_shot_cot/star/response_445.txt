Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: (3, 4, 8)
2. Node 1: (3, 9, 0)
3. Node 2: (5, 6, 8)
4. Node 3: (0, 1, 5)
5. Node 4: (0, 8, 3)
6. Node 5: (2, 3, 9)
7. Node 6: (2, 9, 5)
8. Node 7: (3, 9, 8)
9. Node 8: (0, 2, 4)
10. Node 9: (1, 5, 6)

Counting the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 8, 3)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 9, 5)>, <7, (3, 9, 8)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
