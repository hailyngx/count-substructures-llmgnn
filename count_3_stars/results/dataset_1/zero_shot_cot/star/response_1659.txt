Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 4, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 7)>
<3, (4, 9, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 1, 1)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 0, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
