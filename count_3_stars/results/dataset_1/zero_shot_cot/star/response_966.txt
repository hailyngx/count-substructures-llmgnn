Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes. The center node of a 3-star can be any of the 10 nodes in the graph.

The possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 1)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
