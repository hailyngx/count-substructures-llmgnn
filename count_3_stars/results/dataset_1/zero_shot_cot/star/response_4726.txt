Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- From the given edges, the possible 3-star patterns are:
  1. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
  2. <2, (1, 5, 8)>
  3. <5, (1, 2, 6)>
  4. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
  5. <7, (1, 6, 8)>
  6. <8, (2, 7, 1)>

- There are a total of 6 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph.
