Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node candidates in the graph. Central nodes are the ones that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the candidates: 
- Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes
- Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes
- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes
- Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes

Therefore, the central nodes are 6, 8, and 9. Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. 

There are two possible 3-stars in this graph:
1. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <8, (1, 3, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
