Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 0)>
<2, (8, 4, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (9, 0, 0)>
<7, (3, 9, 0)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
