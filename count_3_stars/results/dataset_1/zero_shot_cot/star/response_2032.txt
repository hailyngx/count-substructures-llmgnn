Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 
Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <3, (5, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
6. <7, (1, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [6].
