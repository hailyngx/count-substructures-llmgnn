Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 9)
2. Central node 4: (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 6)
3. Central node 6: (6, 4, 8)
4. Central node 8: (8, 6, 7)
5. Central node 9: (9, 0, 1)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 8)>, <8, (6, 7)>, and <9, (0, 1)>.
