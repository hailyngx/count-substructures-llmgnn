Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star pattern by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we can count the occurrences of each unique 3-star.

Let's start by identifying the 3-star configurations:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
<9, (2, 7, 2)>

Now, let's count the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star:

- <0, (2, 4, 5)> appears once.
- <1, (4, 5, 6)> appears once.
- <2, (0, 3, 5)> appears once.
- <3, (2, 5, 7)> appears once.
- <4, (0, 1, 5)> appears once.
- <5, (0, 1, 2)> appears once.
- <6, (0, 1, 7)> appears once.
- <7, (3, 5, 6)> appears once.
- <8, (2, 5, 3)> appears once.
- <9, (2, 7, 2)> appears once.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
