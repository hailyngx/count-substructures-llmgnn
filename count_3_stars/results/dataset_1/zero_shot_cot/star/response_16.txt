Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with three neighbors connected to them. 

After examining the graph, we find that there are 5 unique 3-stars. 

The 3-stars are:
1. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. <0, (6, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 8)>
4. <4, (5, 7, 9)>
5. <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
