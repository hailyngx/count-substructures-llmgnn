Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the edges given, we can observe that nodes 0, 1, and 2 are central nodes because each of them is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For central node 0:
- (0, 2, 1) 
- (0, 5, 4) 
- (0, 7, 8) 
- (0, 8, 1) 

For central node 1:
- (1, 2, 0) 
- (1, 8, 0) 
- (1, 9, 2) 

For central node 2:
- (2, 1, 0) 
- (2, 9, 1) 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10] <0, (2, 1, 0)>, <0, (5, 4, 0)>, <0, (7, 8, 0)>, <0, (8, 1, 0)>, <1, (2, 0, 1)>, <1, (8, 0, 1)>, <1, (9, 2, 1)>, <2, (1, 0, 2)>, <2, (9, 1, 2)>].
