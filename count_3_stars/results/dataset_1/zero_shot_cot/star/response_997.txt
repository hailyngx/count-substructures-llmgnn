Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6)
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   (There are 2 3-stars with node 0 as the center)

2. Node 1: (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7)
   - <1, (0, 2, 7)>
   (There is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center)

3. Node 2: (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6)
   - <2, (0, 1, 6)>
   (There is 1 3-star with node 2 as the center)

4. Node 4: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5)
   - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
   (There is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center)

5. Node 6: (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8)
   - <6, (0, 2, 7)>
   - <6, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <6, (0, 7, 8)>
   (There are 3 3-stars with node 6 as the center)

6. Node 7: (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8)
   - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
   (There is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center)

7. Node 8: (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7)
   - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
   (There is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.
