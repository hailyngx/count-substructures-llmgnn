Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (0, 1)
    - Node 0 can be the center of a 3-star. But in this case, there are not enough edges to form a 3-star with node 0 as the center. 

2. Nodes connected to node 1: (1, 0), (1, 7), (7, 1)
    - Node 1 can be the center of a 3-star: <1, (0, 7, 9)>

3. Nodes connected to node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8), (8, 2)
    - Node 2 can be the center of a 3-star: <2, (4, 8, 1)>

4. Nodes connected to node 3: (3, 4), (4, 3)
    - Node 3 cannot be the center of a 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.

5. Nodes connected to node 4: (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 8), (8, 4)
    - Node 4 can be the center of a 3-star: <4, (3, 2, 8)>

6. Nodes connected to node 5: (5, 9), (9, 5)
    - Node 5 cannot be the center of a 3-star as it is only connected to 1 node.

7. Nodes connected to node 7: (7, 1), (7, 9), (9, 7)
    - Node 7 can be the center of a 3-star: <7, (1, 9, 0)>

8. Nodes connected to node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (4, 8)
    - Node 8 can be the center of a 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 1)>

9. Nodes connected to node 9: (9, 5), (9, 7), (7, 9)
    - Node 9 can be the center of a 3-star: <9, (5, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 1)>, <4, (3, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 9, 0)>>.
