Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node in the graph and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: Not a part of any 3-star
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, X)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 6, X)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
  
So, the final answer is [7].
