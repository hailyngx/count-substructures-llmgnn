This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
