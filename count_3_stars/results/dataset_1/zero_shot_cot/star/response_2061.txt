Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. The nodes with exactly 3 edges are potential central nodes in a 3-star graph. 
- Node 2 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 3 edges
- Node 4 has 6 edges
- Node 7 has 4 edges
- Node 8 has 6 edges

Therefore, the potential central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 3 and 7. Let's create 3-stars using these potential central nodes.
After examining the edges, we find the following 3-stars:
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 0, 8)>
- <3, (8, 1, 2)>
- <7, (4, 2, 8)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.
So, the final answer is [4].
