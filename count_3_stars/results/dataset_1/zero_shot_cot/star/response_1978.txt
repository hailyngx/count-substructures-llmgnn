Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Initialize a counter for the number of 3-stars.
2. Examine each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star.
3. For each node, check if it has exactly three edges connected to it.
4. If a node has three edges, check if these edges connect to distinct nodes.
5. If the above conditions are met, increment the counter by 1.

Let's go ahead and apply this process to the given graph:

1. Nodes:
   - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

2. Based on the given edges, the 3-stars are formed by the following nodes:
   - Node 0: (2, 3, 7) from edges (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7)
   - Node 1: (4, 5, 7) from edges (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7)
   - Node 3: (4, 7, 9) from edges (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 9)
   - Node 5: (1, 7, 9) from edges (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
