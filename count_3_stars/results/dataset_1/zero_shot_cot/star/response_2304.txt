Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's go through each node and its connections to see the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7)
    <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5)
- Node 3: (3, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 6)
    <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4)
    <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 6)

Count of 3-stars found in the given graph: [4]  
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>
