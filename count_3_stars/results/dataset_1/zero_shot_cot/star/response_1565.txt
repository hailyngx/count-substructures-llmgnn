Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7)

            | 
            5

     4 --- 0 --- 1
            | 
            9

     4 --- 3 --- 2
            | 
            5

     5 --- 1 --- 3
            |

     5 --- 8 --- 1
            | 
            3

     5 --- 3 --- 1
            | 
            8

     6
      \
       9
      / 

     7 --- 8
            | 
            9

     7 --- 9
            | 
            8

     8 --- 1 --- 5
            | 
            3

     8 --- 7 --- 9
            | 
            5

     8 --- 5 --- 1
            | 
            3

     9 --- 0 --- 6
            | 
            3

     9 --- 2 --- 3
            | 
            4

     9 --- 3 --- 0
            | 
            6

     9 --- 7 --- 8
            | 
            5

     9 --- 6 --- 0
            | 
            3

From the above analyses, we find the following unique 3-star graphs:
    
    <0, (1, 4, 9)>
    <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    <1, (2, 3, 5)>
    <2, (1, 0, 9)>
    <2, (3, 4, 5)>
    <3, (1, 2, 5)>
    <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    <4, (2, 3, 5)>
    <5, (1, 3, 8)>
    <6, (9)>
    <7, (8, 9)>
    <8, (1, 5, 3)>
    <8, (7, 9, 5)>
    <9, (0, 6, 3)>
    <9, (2, 3, 4)>
    <9, (7, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
