Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-star graphs.

The nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 1, 2, 4, 9.

Let's now count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 8) --> 2 3-stars
- For node 2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 7, 9) --> 2 3-stars
- For node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 9, 7) --> 2 3-stars
- For node 9: (9, 2, 3), (9, 4, 7) --> 2 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [2 + 2 + 2 + 2] = [8].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
