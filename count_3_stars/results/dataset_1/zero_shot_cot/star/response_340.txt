Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The node with the highest degree will be the center of a 3-star. In this case, nodes 1 and 6 both have a degree of 5, making them both potential centers.

Let's first consider node 1 as the center. We will look for 3-stars with node 1 as the central node.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- We can form 3-stars with node 1 as the center with the sets of nodes: (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 7), (0, 2, 8), (0, 2, 9), (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 8), (0, 3, 9), (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 8), (2, 3, 9), (7, 8, 9).

Next, let's consider node 6 as the center. We will look for 3-stars with node 6 as the central node.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- We can form 3-stars with node 6 as the center with the sets of nodes: (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 7), (0, 2, 8), (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 8), (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 8), (2, 7, 8).

So, the unique 3-stars in this graph are <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
