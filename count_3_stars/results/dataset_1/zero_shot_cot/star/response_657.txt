Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9. Therefore, <0, (2, 6, 8)> and <0, (2, 6, 9)> are two 3-stars.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3. Therefore, <2, (0, 1, 3)> is one 3-star.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, and <5, (4, 6, 9)> are three 3-stars.

Combining all the unique 3-stars found, we get:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, and <5, (4, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
