Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5)>
<8, (1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
