Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that have exactly three neighbors forming 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0 with neighbors 1, 3, and 4: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Central node 1 with neighbors 0, 3, and 6: <1, (0, 3, 6)>
3. Central node 3 with neighbors 0, 1, and 2: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
4. Central node 4 with neighbors 0, 3, and 5: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. Central node 6 with neighbors 0, 1, and 3: <6, (0, 1, 3)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
