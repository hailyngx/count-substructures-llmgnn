Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 0, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
