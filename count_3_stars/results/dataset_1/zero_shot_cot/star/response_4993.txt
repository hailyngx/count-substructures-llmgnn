Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

The 3-star patterns in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 9, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 9, 2)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (8)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Count of unique 3-stars: [9]
