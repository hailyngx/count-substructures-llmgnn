Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential central nodes of 3-stars:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 8
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 5
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 8
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 8
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 8
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 8
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
   - Node 9: Connected to node 8

2. For each potential central node, check if it forms a 3-star with exactly 3 other nodes:
   - Node 0 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, 2. <1, (0, 8, 2)>
   - Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, 2. <5, (0, 7, 2)>
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, 9. <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [2]
Unique 3-stars found: <<1, (0, 8, 2)>, <5, (0, 7, 2)>]
