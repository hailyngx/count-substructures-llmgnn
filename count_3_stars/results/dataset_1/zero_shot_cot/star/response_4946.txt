Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 0)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 9)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
