Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 6)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<5, (7, 6, 1)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
