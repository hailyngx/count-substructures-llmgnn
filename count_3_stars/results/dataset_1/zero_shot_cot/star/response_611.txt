Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by finding all the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 
This graph has [7] 3-stars.
