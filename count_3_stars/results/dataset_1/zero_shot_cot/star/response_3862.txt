Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Starting with node 0:  
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7: <0, (2, 5, 7)>  
- No other 3-stars with node 0.

Moving to node 1:  
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <1, (4, 5, 7)>  
- No other 3-stars with node 1.

Next is node 2:  
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7: <2, (0, 5, 7)>  
- No other 3-stars with node 2.

Then node 3:  
- Node 3 doesn't form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 4:  
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7: <4, (1, 5, 7)>  
- No other 3-stars with node 4.

Next is node 5:  
- Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 7)> and <5, (1, 4, 7)>  
- No other 3-stars with node 5.

Then node 6:  
- Node 6 doesn't form a 3-star.

Moving on to node 7:  
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2: <7, (0, 1, 2)>  
- No other 3-stars with node 7.

Next is node 8:  
- Node 8 doesn't form a 3-star with only 1 or 2 other nodes.

Lastly, node 9:  
- Node 9 doesn't form a 3-star.  

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4, so the answer is [4].]
