Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 

Let's start by identifying the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:

- Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9)
- Node 5 has 5 edges: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 9)
- Node 6 has 4 edges: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7)
- Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8)

From the identified nodes, we can form the following 3-stars:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
