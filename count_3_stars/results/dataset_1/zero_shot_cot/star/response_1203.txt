Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 5 are connected to Node 0 in a 3-star configuration. 
- Node 0 is the center of each of these 3-stars.

Therefore, we have three 3-stars around Node 0:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1:
- Node 0 and Node 7 are connected to Node 1.
- However, they do not form a 3-star configuration because Node 0 and Node 7 are not connected.

Moving on to Node 2:
- Node 4 and Node 7 are connected to Node 2.
- However, they do not form a 3-star configuration because Node 4 and Node 7 are not connected.

Continuing to Node 3:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 3.
- However, there are no other nodes connected to Node 3 to form a 3-star.

Now, looking at Node 4:
- Node 2, Node 5, and Node 6 are connected to Node 4 in a 3-star configuration. 
- Node 4 is the central node of each of these 3-stars.

We have three more 3-stars:
<4, (2, 5, 6)>

Moving on to Node 5:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 6 are connected to Node 5 in a 3-star configuration. 
- Node 5 is the center of each of these 3-stars.

We have three more 3-stars:
<5, (0, 4, 6)>

Now, checking Node 6:
- Node 4 and Node 5 are connected to Node 6.
- However, they do not form a 3-star configuration because they are not all connected to each other.

Next, Node 7:
- Node 1, Node 2, and Node 9 are connected to Node 7 in a 3-star configuration. 
- Node 7 is the center of each of these 3-stars.

We have three more 3-stars:
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Lastly, Node 9:
- Node 7 is connected to Node 9.
- However, there are no other nodes connected to Node 9 to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, and <7, (1, 2, 9)>.
