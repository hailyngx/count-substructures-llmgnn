Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (7, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (8, 9, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (7, 5, 0)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 9, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
