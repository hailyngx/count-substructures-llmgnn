Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8. As it is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 2, and 4), a 3-star is formed with node 5 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 4 as the leaves. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
   
2. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6. As it is connected to exactly three other nodes (3, 4, and 6), a 3-star is formed with node 8 as the center and nodes 3, 4, and 6 as the leaves. <8, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].

Here is the list of unique 3-star graphs:
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
