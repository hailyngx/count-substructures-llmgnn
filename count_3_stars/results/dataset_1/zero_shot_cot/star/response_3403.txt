Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node and check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: 3-star with central node 0 <0, (4, 5)>
- Node 1: 3-star with central node 1 <1, (4, 6)>
- Node 2: 3-star with central node 2 <2, (5, 8)>
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: 3-star with central node 4 <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 5: 3-star with central node 5 <5, (0, 2)>
- Node 6: 3-star with central node 6 <6, (1, 3, 4, 9)>
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: 3-star with central node 8 <8, (2, 7)>
- Node 9: No 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5)>, <1, (4, 6)>, <2, (5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2)>, and <6, (1, 3, 4, 9)>.
