Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Given the information about the graph and the definition of a 3-star, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>

Now, we will count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4].
