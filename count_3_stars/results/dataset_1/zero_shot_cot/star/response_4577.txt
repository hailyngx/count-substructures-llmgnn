Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8. Since node 0 is connected to exactly three other nodes (4, 5, and 6), we have found a 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 6)>.

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9. Since node 4 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 8, and 9), we have found another 3-star: <4, (0, 8, 9)>.

3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7. Since node 8 is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 2, and 4), we have found one more 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, and <8, (0, 2, 4)>.
