Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Given edges:
(0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7)

Let's break down the graph based on the central node and its leaves:

Central node: 0
Leaves: 5, 8
<0, (5, 8)>

Central node: 1
Leaves: 5
<1, (5)>

Central node: 3
Leaves: 5, 6, 8, 9
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>

Central node: 5
Leaves: 0, 1, 3
<5, (0, 1, 3)>

Central node: 6
Leaves: 3
<6, (3)>

Central node: 7
Leaves: 9
<7, (9)>

Central node: 8
Leaves: 0, 3
<8, (0, 3)>

Central node: 9
Leaves: 3, 7
<9, (3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
