Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them down step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9. It forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, and 9. So we have <0, (1, 7, 9)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6. It forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 6. So we have <1, (0, 2, 6)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9. It forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, and 9. However, this star has already been counted in step 1. So no new 3-star here.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 5 and 9. So we have <3, (5, 9)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. It forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, and 8. So we have <4, (2, 5, 8)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. It forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 3, and 4. However, this star has already been counted in step 1. So no new 3-star here.
7. Node 6 is connected to node 1. There is no 3-star involving node 6 since it is not connected to at least two other unique nodes.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. It forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 8. So we have <7, (0, 2, 8)>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 4 and 7. However, this star has already been counted in step 8. So no new 3-star here.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3. It forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, and 3. However, this star has already been counted in step 1. So no new 3-star here.

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>
