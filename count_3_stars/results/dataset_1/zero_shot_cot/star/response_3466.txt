Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

Based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (1, 3, 4, 8).
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 5).
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes (3, 6, 7).
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (2, 4, 7).
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 4).
- Node 9 is connected to 2 other nodes (3, 5).

Now, let's list down all the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in total.
