Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the center nodes in the graph. To be a center node in a 3-star, a node must have exactly three neighbors. 

The center nodes in this graph are nodes 0, 5, and 7. 

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: (0, 3, 6), (0, 6, 7), (0, 8, 5)

- For node 5: (5, 2, 4), (5, 4, 1), (5, 4, 6), (5, 7, 0), (5, 8, 0), (5, 9, 7)

- For node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 5, 2), (7, 5, 9), (7, 0, 3)

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 1, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 5)>, <5, (7, 0, 5)>, <5, (8, 0, 5)>, <5, (9, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (5, 2, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 7)>
