Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes in the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 9) -> <0, (7, 9)>
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8) -> <1, (3, 4, 8)>
3. Node 2: (2, 7), (2, 8) -> <2, (7, 8)>
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9) -> <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>
5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3) -> <4, (1, 3)>
6. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 7) -> <6, (3, 7)>
7. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 6) -> <7, (0, 2, 6)>
8. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2) -> <8, (1, 2)>
9. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3) -> <9, (0, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
