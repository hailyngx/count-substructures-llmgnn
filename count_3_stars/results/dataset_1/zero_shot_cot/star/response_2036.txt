Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0:
   The neighbors of Node 0 are 2, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 9)>. 

2. Node 1:
   The neighbors of Node 1 are 2, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 7)>.

3. Node 2:
   The neighbors of Node 2 are 0, 1, 4, and 5. Since it has four neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.

4. Node 3:
   The neighbors of Node 3 are 5, 6, 8, and 9. Since it has four neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 4:
   The neighbors of Node 4 are 2 and 8. Since it has only two neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.

6. Node 5:
   The neighbors of Node 5 are 2 and 3. Since it has only two neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 6:
   The neighbors of Node 6 are 0, 1, 3, and 9. Since it has four neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.

8. Node 7:
   The neighbor of Node 7 is 1. Since it has only one neighbor, it does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 8:
   The neighbors of Node 8 are 3 and 4. Since it has only two neighbors, it does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9:
   The neighbors of Node 9 are 0, 2, 3, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 6)> and <9, (0, 3, 6)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, and <9, (0, 3, 6)>.
