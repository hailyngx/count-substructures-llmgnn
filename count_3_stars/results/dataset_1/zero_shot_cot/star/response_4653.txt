Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
   
   - Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 3, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 3, 4)> and <1, (0, 3, 9)>.
   - Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 2, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (1, 2, 9)>.
   - Node 4 has edges with nodes 1, 2, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (1, 2, 6)>.
   - Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 4, 9)>.
   - Node 8 has edges with nodes 5, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (5, 7, 9)>.

Step 2: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
   
   Total 3-stars: 5
