Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0:
   - (0, 1, 4)
   - (0, 4, 8)
   - (0, 8, 9)
   Therefore, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>.

2. Node 1:
   - (1, 0, 4)
   - (1, 0, 9)
   Therefore, <1, (0, 4, 9)>.

3. Node 2:
   - (2, 1, 5)
   Therefore, <2, (1, 5, 2)>.

4. Node 3:
   - (3, 4, 6)
   - (3, 4, 7)
   - (3, 4, 8)
   Therefore, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>.

5. Node 4:
   - (4, 0, 8)
   - (4, 3, 6)
   - (4, 3, 7)
   - (4, 3, 8)
   - (4, 6, 7)
   Therefore, <4, (0, 8, 4)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>.

6. Node 5:
   - (5, 2, 1)
   Therefore, <5, (2, 1, 5)>.

7. Node 6:
   - (6, 3, 4)
   - (6, 3, 7)
   Therefore, <6, (3, 4, 7)>.

8. Node 7:
   - (7, 3, 4)
   - (7, 3, 6)
   Therefore, <7, (3, 4, 6)>.

9. Node 8:
   - (8, 0, 4)
   - (8, 0, 9)
   - (8, 3, 4)
   - (8, 3, 9)
   Therefore, <8, (0, 4, 8)>.

10. Node 9:
   - (9, 0, 8)
   - (9, 0, 1)
   - (9, 8, 0)
   Therefore, <9, (0, 1, 9)>.

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 13.]
