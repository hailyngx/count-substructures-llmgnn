Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars: 

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the graph.
