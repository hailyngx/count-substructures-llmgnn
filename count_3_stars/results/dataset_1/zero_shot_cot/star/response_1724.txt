Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected directly to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 5)
- Node 1: (1, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 3, 4)
- Node 3: (0, 3, 4)
- Node 4: (1, 3, 5)
- Node 4: (3, 4, 5)
- Node 4: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 5: (1, 4, 5)
- Node 5: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 6, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 7, 8)
- Node 6: (5, 6, 7)
- Node 7: (0, 3, 7)
- Node 7: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (5, 6, 7)
- Node 7: (6, 7, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 5, 8)
- Node 9: (6, 7, 9)
  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
