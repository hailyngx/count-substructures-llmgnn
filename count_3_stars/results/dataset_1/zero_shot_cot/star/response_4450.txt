Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
