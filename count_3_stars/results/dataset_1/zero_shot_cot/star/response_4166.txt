Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with three neighbors.
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 has neighbors 1, 3, 9.

Step 2: List the unique 3-stars. 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars. 
[11]

Therefore, there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
