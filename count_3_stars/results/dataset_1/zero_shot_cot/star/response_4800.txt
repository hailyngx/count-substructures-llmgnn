Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's consider each node one by one to find the number of 3-stars.

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to node 6. Hence, there is no 3-star with node 0 as the center.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. 
- There is one 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 3, x)>. (Note: x can be any node other than 1, 2, and 3)

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9.
- There are two 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 5, 6)> and <2, (1, 6, 9)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to node 1. Hence, there is no 3-star with node 3 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 6. Hence, there is no 3-star with node 4 as the center.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- There is one 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (2, 6, x)>. (Note: x can be any node other than 2 and 6)

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- There are three 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, and <6, (2, 4, 9)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- There is one 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (2, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 7.
