Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes and their connections
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars
- Now, let's count the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves. Each 3-star contributes 1 to the count.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars
- There are 8 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
