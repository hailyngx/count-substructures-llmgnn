Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Let's list the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 0
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 6)>
- <1, (2)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (5)>
- <5, (3, 4)>
- <6, (0)>
- <8, (3, 9)>
- <9, (3, 8)>

Count: 9
