Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node that is the center of a 3-star along with its connected nodes. 

Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9, but only forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5. (<0, (1, 4, 5)>)
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9, but only forms a 3-star with node 0 and 5. (<1, (0, 5)>)
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9, but only forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5. (<4, (0, 2, 5)>)
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4. (<5, (0, 1, 4)>)
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, but no 3-stars are formed.
- No other nodes can form 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] (four 3-stars in total). 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>
