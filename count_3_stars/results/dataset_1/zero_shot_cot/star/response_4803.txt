Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
