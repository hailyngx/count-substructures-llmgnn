Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Here are the nodes that have degree 3 based on the given edges: 1, 2, 5, 6.

Now, let's check if any of these nodes are indeed the center of a 3-star by confirming if they are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to 2, 4, 5 (connected to exactly three other nodes).
- Node 2: Connected to 1, 5, 6 (connected to exactly three other nodes).
- Node 5: Connected to 1, 2, 3 (connected to exactly three other nodes).
- Node 6: Connected to 0, 2, 9 (connected to exactly three other nodes).

Thus, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
