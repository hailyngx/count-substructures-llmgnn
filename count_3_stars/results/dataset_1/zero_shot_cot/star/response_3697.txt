Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 6)>  
2. <1, (6, 8, 9)>  
3. <2, (0, 5, 6)>  
4. <3, (0, 4, 8)>  
5. <4, (3, 5, x)>  
6. <5, (2, 4, 9)>  
7. <6, (0, 1, 2)>  
8. <8, (1, 3, 7)>  
9. <9, (1, 5, x)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
