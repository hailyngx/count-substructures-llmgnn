Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9: <5, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9: <6, (2, 4, 9)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6: <7, (3, 4, 6)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5: <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
