Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Next, we need to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them: 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
  
Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique ones: [3].
