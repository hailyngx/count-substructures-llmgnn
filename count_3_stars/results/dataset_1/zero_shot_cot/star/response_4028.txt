Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node. 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

There are two 3-stars with center at node 0:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>

There are two 3-stars with center at node 1:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>

There are no 3-stars with center at node 2.

There are no 3-stars with center at node 3.

There is one 3-star with center at node 5:
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

There are no 3-stars with center at node 6.

There is one 3-star with center at node 7:
<7, (0, 6, 9)>

There are no 3-stars with center at node 8.

There are no 3-stars with center at node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
