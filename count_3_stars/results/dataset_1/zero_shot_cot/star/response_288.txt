Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, following the definition of a 3-star. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) 
   <1, (0, 6, 7)>

2. Node 2: (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6)
   <2, (4, 5, 6)>

3. Node 3: (3, 8) (3, 9)
   <3, (8, 9)>

4. Node 6: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9)
   <6, (1, 2, 8)> 
   <6, (1, 2, 9)>
   <6, (8, 9)>

5. Node 8: (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9)
   <8, (3, 6, 9)>

6. Node 9: (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8)
   <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
