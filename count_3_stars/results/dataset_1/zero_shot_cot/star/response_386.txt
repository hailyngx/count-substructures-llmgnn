Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them below:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
