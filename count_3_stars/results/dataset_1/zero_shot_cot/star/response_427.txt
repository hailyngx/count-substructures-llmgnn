Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central node of a 3-star graph will have exactly 3 edges connected to it. Based on the given edges, nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 7 have 3 edges connected to them.

1. For central node 0: (0, 1), (0, 5), (1, 0)
2. For central node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (4, 1)
3. For central node 4: (4, 1), (4, 8), (8, 4)
4. For central node 5: (5, 0), (5, 7), (7, 5)
5. For central node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9), (9, 7)

Now we can form the 3-stars using each central node connected to its 3 neighboring nodes:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>.
