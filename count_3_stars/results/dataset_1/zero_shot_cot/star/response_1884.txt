Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to node 0 since node 0 will be the central node of the 3-stars. 
These nodes are: 1, 3, 6, 8.

Next, for each of these nodes, we need to find all unique combinations of two other nodes connected to it that are not directly connected to each other. These combinations will form a 3-star with the central node being one of the nodes directly connected to node 0.

For node 1:
- (1, 2, 7) is a 3-star.

For node 3:
- (3, 8, 4) is a 3-star.

For node 6:
- (6, 2, 7) is a 3-star.
- (6, 4, 7) is a 3-star.

For node 8:
- (8, 4, 6) is a 3-star.

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 7), (3, 8, 4), (6, 2, 7), (6, 4, 7), (8, 4, 6)>.
