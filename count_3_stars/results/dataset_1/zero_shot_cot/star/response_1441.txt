Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves).

Let's analyze the graph:
- Node 0 has 2 edges
- Node 1 has 2 edges
- Node 2 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 2 edges
- Node 4 has 3 edges
- Node 5 has 1 edge
- Node 6 has 2 edges
- Node 7 has 1 edge
- Node 8 has 1 edge
- Node 9 has 2 edges

Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (1, 2, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 6, 9)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, and <4, (1, 6, 9)>.
