Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would represent the center of a 3-star.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
