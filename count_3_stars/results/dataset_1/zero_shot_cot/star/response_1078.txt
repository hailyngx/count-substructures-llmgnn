Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 6, 7)>
2. Node 3: <3, (2, 4, 5)>
3. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
4. Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 4)>
5. Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 7)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
