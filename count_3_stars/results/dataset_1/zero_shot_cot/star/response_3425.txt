Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each possible 3-star. Then we can count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

1. For node 0:
    - Possible 3-stars: <0, (1, 6, 6)>
2. For node 1:
    - Possible 3-stars: <1, (0, 6, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 6)>
3. For node 2:
    - Possible 3-stars: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. For node 3:
    - Possible 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
5. For node 5:
    - Possible 3-stars: <5, (3, 8, 9)>
6. For node 6:
    - Possible 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 1)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (8, 1, 1)>
7. For node 7:
    - No 3-stars possible.
8. For node 8:
    - Possible 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>
9. For node 9:
    - Possible 3-stars: <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 8)>

Count of unique 3-stars = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
