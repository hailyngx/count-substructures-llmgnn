Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are the nodes with exactly three neighbors. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 9 are central nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 7, 8, 9
   <0, (7, 8, 9)>

2. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 1, 5, 9
   <2, (1, 5, 9)>

3. Central node: 9
   Leaves: 0, 8, 5
   <9, (0, 8, 5)>
