Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can create the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>
<3, (8)>
<4, (1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 9)>
<7, (1, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
