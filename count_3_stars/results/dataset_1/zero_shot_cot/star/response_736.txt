Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph.

From the description, we see that the central node in a 3-star will always have 3 edges connected to it. We can start by listing all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 6)>
<8, (0, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph. We counted them above and found 10 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
