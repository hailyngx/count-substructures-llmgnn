Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- 3-star <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- 3-star <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- 3-star <2, (0, 6, 8)>
- 3-star <4, (1, 8, 9)>
- 3-star <6, (0, 2, 5)>
- 3-star <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- 3-star <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- 3-star <9, (2, 4, 7)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.
