Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 
Then, we count how many times each unique 3-star appears in the graph. Finally, we sum up these counts to get the total number of 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>

Now, let's count how many times each of these unique 3-stars appears in the graph:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)> appears 1 time
- <0, (3, 7, 9)> appears 1 time
- <1, (2, 4, 7)> appears 1 time
- <1, (2, 7, 9)> appears 1 time
- <2, (1, 3, 8)> appears 1 time
- <2, (1, 8, 9)> appears 1 time
- <3, (0, 2, 6)> appears 1 time
- <3, (0, 6, 8)> appears 1 time
- <4, (0, 1, 7)> appears 1 time
- <7, (0, 1, 4)> appears 1 time

Finally, we sum up the counts to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[10].
