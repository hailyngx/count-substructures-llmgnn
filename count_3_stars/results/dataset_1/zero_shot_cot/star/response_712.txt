Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. Nodes 0, 5, 8 form a 3-star with center at node 8.
2. Nodes 2, 3, 4 form a 3-star with center at node 3.
3. Nodes 8, 6, 9 form a 3-star with center at node 8.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
   
<8, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 8, 9)>
