Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, -)>
<3, (0, 5, -)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, -,-)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
