Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Since it has 6 edges, it forms a 3-star with 3 leaves: <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 2, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. The unique 3-stars found are <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 2, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 2)>.
