Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [7].
