Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking at nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Nodes with three edges connected to them:  
- Node 0 has 5 edges (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9).
- Node 1 has 2 edges (1, 0), (1, 2).
- Node 2 has 5 edges (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7).
- Node 4 has 4 edges (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8).
- Node 5 has 3 edges (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6).
- Node 6 has 3 edges (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5).
- Node 8 has 2 edges (8, 0), (8, 4).
- Node 9 has 2 edges (9, 0), (9, 1).

2. From the list above, we can see that nodes 0, 5, 6 have exactly three edges connected to them, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

3. Counting the 3-stars centered at each potential center:
- Centered at node 0: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- Centered at node 5: <5, (2, 4, 6)>

4. Combining all unique 3-stars found:
[3]  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>
