Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Since we have found four unique instances of 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
