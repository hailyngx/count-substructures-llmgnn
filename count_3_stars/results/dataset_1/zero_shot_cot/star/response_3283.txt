Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>  
<0, (2, 8, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4, 5)>  
<4, (1, 3, 8)>  

Considering the graph symmetry, we can see that each identified 3-star can be rotated in different ways to identify additional 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

<0, (2, 3, 7)>  
<0, (2, 8, 9)>  
<2, (0, 4, 5)>  
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
