Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes in the graph. From the given edges, we have the following nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's determine the 3-star graphs in this network.

1. From node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 8)
2. From node 1: (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 9)
3. From node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 0, 6)
4. From node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 0, 2), (4, 6, 5)
5. From node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 6), (5, 1, 9)
6. From node 8: (8, 0, 7), (8, 0, 9)
7. From node 9: (9, 1, 5), (9, 1, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (6, 5, 0)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 9, 0)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>.
