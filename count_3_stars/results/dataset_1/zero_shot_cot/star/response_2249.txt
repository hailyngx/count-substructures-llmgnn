Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the central nodes:
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, and 9.
   - Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 9 (already counted), and also 1 (already counted).
   - Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 8 and 9 (already counted).
   - Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 9 (already counted).

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - For node 0: (0, 4, 6, 8), (0, 4, 6, 9), (0, 4, 8, 9), and (0, 6, 8, 9). Total = 4
   - For node 3: (3, 1, 4, 9), (3, 1, 4, 9), (3, 4, 9, 1), and (3, 4, 9, 1). Total = 4
   - For node 5: No 3-stars can be formed because it does not have enough neighbors.
   - For node 7: No 3-stars can be formed because it does not have enough neighbors.

3. Combine the results:
   - The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4 + 4 = 8.

Therefore, the answer is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
