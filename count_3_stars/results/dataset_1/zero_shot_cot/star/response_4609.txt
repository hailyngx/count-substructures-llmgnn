Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 2 -- 8 -- 7 -- 1
|         |    |    |
3 -- 5    7 -- 6 -- 9
|
6 -- 9
```

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are all connected to more than 3 other nodes, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
2. Nodes 1 and 4 are not connected to any other nodes, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
3. Nodes 6 and 7 are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, so they can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
