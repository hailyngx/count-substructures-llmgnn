Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (1)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get:

[9]
