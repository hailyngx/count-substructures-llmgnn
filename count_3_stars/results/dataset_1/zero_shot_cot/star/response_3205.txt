Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 6
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 3 and 5
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 2 and 7
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 7, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to Node 2
- Node 6 is connected to Node 1
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to Node 4
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 4 and 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: no 3-star as it's only connected to one node.
- Node 2: <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 7, 4)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 5: no 3-star as it's only connected to one node.
- Node 6: no 3-star as it's only connected to one node.
- Node 7: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 8: no 3-star as it's only connected to one node.
- Node 9: no 3-star as it's only connected to two nodes.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 4)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>.
