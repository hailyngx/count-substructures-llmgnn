Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star subgraphs in this graph. 

First, we can identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them). In this case, the central nodes are 0, 1, and 5.

Next, we identify the leaves connected to each central node:

- For central node 0: leaves are 1, 2, and 5
- For central node 1: leaves are 0, 5, and 9
- For central node 5: leaves are 0, 1, and 7

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
