Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- From node 4: <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- From node 8: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- From node 9: <9, (0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
