Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. These can potentially be central nodes of 3-star structures.

2. For each of these potential central nodes, check if they form a 3-star structure with their neighbors. A 3-star structure consists of a central node and exactly three connected leaves.

Let's start with step 1:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's check for 3-star structures around these potential central nodes:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (8, 0, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (8, 0, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
