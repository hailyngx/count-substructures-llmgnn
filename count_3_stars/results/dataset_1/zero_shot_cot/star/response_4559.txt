Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars we find in the graph:

<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (9)>
<5, (3, 9)>
<6, (2)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
