Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 2)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
3. Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (0, 2, 4)> and <5, (6, 4, 0)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 9)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
