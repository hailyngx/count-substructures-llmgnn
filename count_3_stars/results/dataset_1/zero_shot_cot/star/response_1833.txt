Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <1, (0, 3, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <3, (1, 4, 5)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 7: <4, (2, 3, 7)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <7, (3, 4, 6)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
