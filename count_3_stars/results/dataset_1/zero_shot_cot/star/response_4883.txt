Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars that exist:

<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7)>
<2, (6, 9)>
<3, (5, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 5, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars represented above:

[9]
