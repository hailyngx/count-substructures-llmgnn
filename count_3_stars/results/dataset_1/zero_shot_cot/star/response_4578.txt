Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes in the graph. From the provided edges, we can see that the nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

So there are a total of 5 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
