Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Start by listing all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5: (1, 6, 7, 9)
   - Node 6: (1, 4, 5)

2. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <6, (1, 4, 5)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: 
   - There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
