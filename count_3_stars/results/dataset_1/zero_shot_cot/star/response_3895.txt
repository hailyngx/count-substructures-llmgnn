Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be considered as the central node of a 3-star.  
Based on the given edges, nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are directly connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: For each identified central node, list the nodes that are connected to it to form a 3-star.  
For node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>  
For node 4: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>  
For node 5: <5, (7, 9, -)>  
For node 6: <6, (0, 2, 9)>  
For node 7: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars formed.  
There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
