Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 9, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
