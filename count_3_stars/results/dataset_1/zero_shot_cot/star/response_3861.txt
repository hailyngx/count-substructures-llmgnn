Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 valid 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are:
<0, (1, 9, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 4)>
<7, (5, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
