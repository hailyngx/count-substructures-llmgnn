Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes.  
    - Central nodes are nodes that have exactly three incident edges.  

Central nodes: {0, 3, 4}

Step 2: For each central node, identify the adjacent nodes as leaves.  
    - Leaves are nodes that are directly connected to the central node.  

Central node 0:
Leaves: {1, 6, 8}  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>

Central node 3:
Leaves: {1, 4, 8, 9}  
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>

Central node 4:
Leaves: {3, 6, 9}
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 3)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.  
    - Add up the count of unique 3-stars identified in each step.
