Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.

Therefore, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in total.
