Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central Node 1:
   - (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7)

2. Central Node 2:
   - (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9)

3. Central Node 4:
   - (4, 1) (4, 6)

4. Central Node 5:
   - (5, 2) (5, 8)

5. Central Node 6:
   - (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9)

6. Central Node 7:
   - (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9)

7. Central Node 9:
   - (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6)>
<5, (2, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
