Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 5. (<0, (7, 9, 5)>)
2. Node 1 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to nodes 5 and 6, instead of 3 nodes.
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9. (<2, (6, 7, 9)>)
4. Node 3 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to node 8, instead of 3 nodes.
5. Node 4 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to node 5, instead of 3 nodes.
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9. (<5, (1, 4, 9)>)
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7. (<6, (1, 2, 7)>)
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8. (<7, (0, 2, 8)>)
9. Node 8 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to nodes 3 and 7, instead of 3 nodes.
10. Node 9 does not form any 3-star as it is only connected to nodes 0 and 5, instead of 3 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (7, 9, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
