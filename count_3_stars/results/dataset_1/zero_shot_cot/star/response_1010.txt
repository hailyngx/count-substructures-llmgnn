Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars based on the provided edges:
1. Node 1:
   - (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9): <1, (5, 7, 9)>
2. Node 2:
   - (2, 4), (2, 8): <2, (4, 8)>
3. Node 4:
   - (4, 2): <4, (2, 8)>
4. Node 5: No 3-star centered at node 5.
5. Node 6: No 3-star centered at node 6.
6. Node 7:
   - (7, 1): <7, (1, 6, 9)>
7. Node 8:
   - (8, 2), (8, 9): <8, (2, 9)>
8. Node 9:
   - (9, 1), (9, 8): <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Combining all unique 3-stars we found:
<>
1. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
2. <2, (4, 8)>
3. <7, (1, 6, 9)>
4. <8, (2, 9)>
5. <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [5]
