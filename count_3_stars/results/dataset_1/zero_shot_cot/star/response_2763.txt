Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

We will now list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [6]
