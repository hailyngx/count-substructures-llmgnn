Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars found in this graph:

<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
