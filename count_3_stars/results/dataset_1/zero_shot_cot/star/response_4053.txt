Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Center node: 0
   Leaves: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8
   <0, (2, 5, 6)>
   <0, (2, 5, 7)>
   <0, (2, 6, 7)>
   <0, (2, 7, 8)>
   <0, (5, 6, 7)>
   <0, (5, 7, 8)>
   <0, (6, 7, 8)>

2. Center node: 2
   Leaves: 0, 3, 9
   <2, (0, 3, 9)>

3. Center node: 5
   Leaves: 0, 7
   <5, (0, 7)>

4. Center node: 6
   Leaves: 0, 1
   <6, (0, 1)>

5. Center node: 7
   Leaves: 0, 4, 5
   <7, (0, 4, 5)>

6. Center node: 8
   Leaves: 0, 9
   <8, (0, 9)>

7. Center node: 9
   Leaves: 2, 8
   <9, (2, 8)>

[Total number of 3-stars: **10**]
