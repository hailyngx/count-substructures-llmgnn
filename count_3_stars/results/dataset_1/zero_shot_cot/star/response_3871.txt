Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

From the given edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (8, 2, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
