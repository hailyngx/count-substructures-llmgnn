Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars present based on the given edges. Then we can count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 8)>
5. <6, (0, 4, 9)>
6. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [6]
