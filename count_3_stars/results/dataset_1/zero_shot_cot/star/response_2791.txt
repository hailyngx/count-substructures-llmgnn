Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three neighbors. 

- Node 0 is connected to 2, 6, and 6 (repeated).
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 6, and 6 (repeated).
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 2, 5, and 7, but it only forms a valid 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5.

Therefore, there is one unique 3-star in this graph: <6, (0, 2, 5)>.

Thus, the final answer is [1].
