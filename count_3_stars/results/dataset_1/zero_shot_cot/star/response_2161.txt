Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <7, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
