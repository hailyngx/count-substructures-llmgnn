Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (4, 8)>
- 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 2: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 4: <4, (0, 2, 7)>
- 3-stars centered at node 6: <6, (1, 5, 7), (1, 7, 9), (2, 6, 8), (3, 6, 9), (4, 6, 7)>
- 3-stars centered at node 7: <7, (2, 4, 6), (3, 7, 9), (6, 7, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (0, 1, 6), (0, 2, 8), (0, 3, 9), (1, 6, 8), (2, 6, 8), (3, 6, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 9: <9, (1, 3, 6), (3, 6, 9), (4, 6, 7), (6, 7, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find that there are the following number of unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
