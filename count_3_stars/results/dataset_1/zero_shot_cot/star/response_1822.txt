Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Let's list the nodes with their edges:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), and (0, 6) [Degree: 5]
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 7), and (1, 9) [Degree: 4]
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), and (2, 9) [Degree: 5]
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2) [Degree: 2]
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7) [Degree: 3]
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 9) [Degree: 3]
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 9) [Degree: 4]
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 9) [Degree: 3]
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 9) [Degree: 3]
- Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), and (9, 8) [Degree: 6]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)> 
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)> 

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
