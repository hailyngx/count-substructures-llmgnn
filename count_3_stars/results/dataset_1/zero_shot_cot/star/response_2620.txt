Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step. 

First, let's list all the nodes in the graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 7) -> <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 9) -> <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6) -> <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9) -> <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>
5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5) -> <4, (1, 3, 5)>
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it's connected to only one node.
7. Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 8) -> <6, (2, 8, 6)>
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 9) -> <7, (0, 9, 7)>
9. Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 6) -> <8, (3, 6, 8)>
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 7) -> <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Now we have listed all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Counting them, we get a total of [8] 3-stars.
