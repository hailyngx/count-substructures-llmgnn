Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

Starting with node 0:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>

Moving on to node 1:
- <1, (6, 8, -)>

For node 2:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>

Node 3:
- <3, (0, 2, -)>

Node 4:
- <4, (2, -, -)>

Node 5:
- <5, (6, -, -)>

Node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 5)> 
- <6, (9, - ,-)>

Node 7:
- <7, (9, -, -)>

Node 8:
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>

Node 9:
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (8, -, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
