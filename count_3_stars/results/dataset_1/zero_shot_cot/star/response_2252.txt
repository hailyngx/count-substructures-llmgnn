Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
3. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
5. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
6. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
7. <6, (4, 5, 1)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 4)>
9. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
10. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
11. <7, (2, 4, 6)>
12. <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
