Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Note that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
