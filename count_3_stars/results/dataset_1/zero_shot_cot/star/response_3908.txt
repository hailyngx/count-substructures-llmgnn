Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 8: <4, (0, 5, 8)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9: <5, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
