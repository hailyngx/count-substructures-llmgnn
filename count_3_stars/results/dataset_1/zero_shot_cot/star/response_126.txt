Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. The central node in each 3-star must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
