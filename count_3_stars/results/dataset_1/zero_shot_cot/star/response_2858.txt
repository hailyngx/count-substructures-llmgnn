Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first find all the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
