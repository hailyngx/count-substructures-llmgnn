Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms 1 star: <0, (3, 7, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms 1 star: <1, (5, 8, 8)>
3. Node 2 does not form any stars.
4. Node 3 forms 1 star: <3, (0, 7, 7)>
5. Node 5 does not form any stars.
6. Node 6 does not form any stars.
7. Node 7 forms 2 stars: <7, (0, 3, 7)> and <7, (8, 8, 9)>
8. Node 8 forms 2 stars: <8, (1, 1, 2)> and <8, (6, 7, 8)>
9. Node 9 does not form any stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 7, 7)>, <1, (5, 8, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (8, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 1, 2)>.
