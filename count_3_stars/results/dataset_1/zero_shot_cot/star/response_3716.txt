Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is the central node with leaves 7, 8, and 9. <0, (7, 8, 9)>
2. Node 2 is the central node with leaves 4 and 8. <2, (4, 8)>
3. Node 4 is the central node with leaves 2, 8, and 9. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
4. Node 5 is the central node with leaves 6, 7, 8, and 9. <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>
5. Node 6 is the central node with leaves 5 and 7. <6, (5, 7)>
6. Node 8 is the central node with leaves 0, 2, 4, 5, and 9. <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>
7. Node 9 is the central node with leaves 0, 4, 5, and 8. <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
