Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star configurations. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- Node 0: (2, 3, 0)
- Node 1: (5, 8, 1)
- Node 2: (0, 6, 8)
- Node 3: (0, 4, 6)
- Node 4: (3, 6, 8)
- Node 5: (1, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (2, 3, 4)
- Node 7: (3, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 2, 3)
- Node 9: (5, 7, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 0)>
<1, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
