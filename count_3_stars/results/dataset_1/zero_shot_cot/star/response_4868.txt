Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Now we count the unique 3-stars: [8]
