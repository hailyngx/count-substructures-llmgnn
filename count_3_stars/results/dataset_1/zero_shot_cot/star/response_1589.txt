Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:
1. Central node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
2. Central node 1 is connected to node 8.
3. Central node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
4. Central node 3 is connected to node 0 and 6.
5. Central node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
6. Central node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
7. Central node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
8. Central node 7 is connected to node 0 and 6.
9. Central node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
10. Central node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Central node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes (2, 5, 6) and (3, 7, 9).
- Central node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 4, 5).
- Central node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 6, 9).
- Central node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 6, 9).
- Central node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 3).
- Central node 6 forms 3-stars with nodes (0, 3, 4) and (0, 7, 9).
- Central node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 9, 6).
- Central node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (0, 6, 8).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
