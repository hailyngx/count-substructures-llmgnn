Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, where each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as they can potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their neighbors. 
3. List the unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the steps to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: Nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4 have exactly three neighbors, which makes them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Checking for 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 4, 8) [2 unique 3-stars]
- Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 4, 6), (1, 8, 0) [3 unique 3-stars]
- Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 4, 0) [2 unique 3-stars]
- Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 2, 0), (4, 5, 8) [3 unique 3-stars]

So, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (4, 8, 1)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
