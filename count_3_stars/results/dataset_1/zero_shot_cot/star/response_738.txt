Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

By looking at the provided edges information, we can identify the possible 3-stars.
- Nodes 0, 1, 4 form a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- Nodes 1, 0, 4 form a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- Nodes 2, 5, 9 form a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (5, 9)>
- Nodes 3, 4, 5 form a 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- Nodes 6, 8, 9 form a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (8, 9)>
- Nodes 8, 3, 6 form a 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (3, 6)>
- Nodes 9, 2, 6 form a 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (2, 6, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph.
