Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (3, 8)>
2. 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (2, 4, 9)>
3. 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
4. 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 2, 9)>
5. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (1, 7)>
6. 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
7. 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (2, 4, 6)>
8. 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (1, 3, 6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
