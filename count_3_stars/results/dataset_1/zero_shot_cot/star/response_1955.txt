Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

We need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, indicating a 3-star structure. 

Nodes with three edges connected:
- Node 0 [ (2, 3, 9) ]
- Node 1 [ (5, 6, 7) ]
- Node 2 [ (0, 6, 7) ]
- Node 4 [ (2, 3, 5) ]
- Node 7 [ (1, 2, 3) ]

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
