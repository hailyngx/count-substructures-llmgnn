Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective connections:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 2
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
