Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes and include them in our count.

After analyzing the provided edges, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (7, 8, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
