Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Analyzing the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star structures.

The 3-star structures can be found by looking for nodes with degree 3, as these nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 3, 7 have degree 3, and each can form a 3-star.

Let's now list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [4] 3-stars present.
