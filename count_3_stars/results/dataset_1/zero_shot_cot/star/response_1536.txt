Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. However, before that, let's identify the nodes that can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes that have exactly three neighbors are potential centers for 3-stars. Let's list those nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
