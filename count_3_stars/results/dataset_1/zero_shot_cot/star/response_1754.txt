Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.  

Based on the given graph, nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 3, 7, 3)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 6, 8, 6)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 3, 9, 3)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 8, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 6, 9, 6)

Step 2: Identify 3-stars in the graph.

By definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. From the identified nodes in step 1, we can form the following 3-stars:

<0, (3, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 8, 6)>
<4, (3, 9, 3)>
<7, (0, 8, 8)>
<5, (6, 9, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars. 

Counting the unique 3-stars listed in step 2, we find that there are 5 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
