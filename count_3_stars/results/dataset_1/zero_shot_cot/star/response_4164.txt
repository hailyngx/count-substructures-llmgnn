Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, which will form a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (9, 5, 0)>
3. <2, (5, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 6, 4)>
5. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (3, 4, 8)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
9. <8, (6, 7, 9)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, the count of 3-stars is [10].
