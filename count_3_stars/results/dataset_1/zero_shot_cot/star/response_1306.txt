Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can see that only node 0, 4, 6, and 7 have degree 3, meaning they are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
