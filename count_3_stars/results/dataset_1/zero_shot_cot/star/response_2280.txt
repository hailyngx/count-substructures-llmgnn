Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 

The degree of each node is as follows: 
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

We see that nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have a degree of 4, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

Now, let's examine each potential central node along with its adjacent nodes to see which ones form 3-stars.

**For node 3:**
- (3, 1, 6, 7)
- (3, 5, 4, 7)

**For node 4:**
- (4, 6, 1, 5)
- (4, 5, 6, 7)
- (4, 7, 3, 9)

**For node 5:**
- (5, 3, 4, 6)
- (5, 4, 6, 7)
- (5, 6, 4, 7)

**For node 6:**
- (6, 1, 4, 5)
- (6, 4, 5, 7)
- (6, 5, 4, 7)
- (6, 9, 4, 5)

**For node 7:**
- (7, 3, 4, 5)
- (7, 4, 5, 6)
- (7, 5, 4, 6)

**For node 9:**
- (9, 4, 6, 8)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 4, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [12].
