Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three edges: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, -)>
<2, (8, -, -)>
<3, (7, 9, -)>
<4, (6, 9, -)>
<5, (6, 7, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
