Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Based on the definition, a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list all the possible 3-stars:

<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 8)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [8]
