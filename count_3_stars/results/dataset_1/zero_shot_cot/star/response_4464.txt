Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them. 

Based on the provided edges, the nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

From the above list, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them are:
- Node 2: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now we can form 3-stars using these nodes. 

Count of 3-stars: [6]
<2, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 7, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (7)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 2, 3)>
