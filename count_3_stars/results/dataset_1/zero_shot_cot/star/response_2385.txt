Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand the structure of a 3-star graph. A 3-star graph consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a shape similar to a star with three points.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-star centered at node 0: (0, 2, 4, 7)
- 3-star centered at node 4: (4, 1, 7, 0)
- 3-star centered at node 6: (6, 5, 7, 8)
- 3-star centered at node 9: (9, 3, 5, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)> []
