Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on the information provided.

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes and their connections as follows:
- Node 2 is connected to 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to 2 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to 2.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
1. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
2. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
4. <8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
