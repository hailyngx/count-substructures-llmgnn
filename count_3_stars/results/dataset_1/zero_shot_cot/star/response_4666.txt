Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

Given the edges:
(0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8)
(1, 5) (1, 8)
(2, 3)
(3, 2) (3, 6)
(4, 6) (4, 8)
(5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8)
(6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9)
(7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8)
(8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7)
(9, 6)

We can observe one 3-star:
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
