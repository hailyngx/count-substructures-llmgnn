Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to a specific node to determine the number of 3-stars each node is a part of. 

For node 0:
- Connected to nodes 3 and 4. 
- Possible 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 4, X)> (X can be any node connected to node 0 except nodes 3 and 4)

For node 1:
- Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Possible 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 2:
- Connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Possible 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
- Connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- Possible 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
- Connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Possible 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 1, X)> (X can be any node connected to node 4 except nodes 0 and 1)

For node 5:
- Connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Possible 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (3, 8, X)> (X can be any node connected to node 5 except nodes 3 and 8)

For node 6:
- Connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Possible 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 9, X)> (X can be any node connected to node 6 except nodes 2 and 9)

For node 7:
- Connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Possible 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 2, X)> (X can be any node connected to node 7 except nodes 1 and 2)

For node 8:
- Connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Possible 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (2, 5, X)> (X can be any node connected to node 8 except nodes 2 and 5)

For node 9:
- Connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Possible 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (3, 6, X)> (X can be any node connected to node 9 except nodes 3 and 6)

By examining the possible 3-stars for each node, we can see that there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [3].
