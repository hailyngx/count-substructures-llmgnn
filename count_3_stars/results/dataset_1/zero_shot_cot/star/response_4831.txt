Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Determine the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
    - Node 2, 3, and 4 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: Check if these nodes form 3-stars and count them.
    - Node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 4, 6) [2 unique 3-stars]
    - Node 3: (3, 0, 4), (3, 2, 4) [2 unique 3-stars]
    - Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 2, 3) [2 unique 3-stars]

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars.
    - Total unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 0, 4)>, <2, (3, 2, 4)>, <3, (4, 2, 3)> [3 unique 3-stars]
