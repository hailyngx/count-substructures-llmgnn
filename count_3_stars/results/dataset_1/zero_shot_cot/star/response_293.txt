Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 3, 6)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

We have the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (6, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>
