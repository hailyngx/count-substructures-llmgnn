Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

- The center node of a 3-star can be any node in the graph.
- The other three nodes connected to the center node should form a triangle (complete subgraph) among themselves. If any of these three nodes are connected to each other, they will form a triangle, but not a 3-star with the center node.
- We will only consider 3-stars with distinct leaves to avoid duplication.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 4, 9)>
<2, (8, 0, 4)>
<3, (6, 2, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 2)>
<5, (4, 1, 0)>
<6, (3, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<8, (0, 9, 2)>
<9, (8, 0, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
