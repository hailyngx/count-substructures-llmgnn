Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the given edges, the nodes with three incident edges are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 6)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 4)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 7)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 3, 6, 8)

Next, we list down all the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
