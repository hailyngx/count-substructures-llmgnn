Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7) <1, (2, 6, 7)>
2. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 7) <2, (1, 4, 7)>
3. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 6) <4, (2, 6, 0)>
4. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 7) <5, (0, 7, 8)>
5. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4) <6, (1, 4, 0)>
6. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 5) <7, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get: [6]  
So, the answer is [6].
