Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node that can act as the center of a 3-star and find all the possible combinations of connecting nodes that form 3-stars around this center node. 

From the given edges, we can determine the possible 3-stars. Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes with degree 3 can act as the center of a 3-star. In this case, the nodes with degree 3 are nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.

2. For each of these potential center nodes, we will find the connected nodes to form 3-stars.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. This forms the 3-star <2, (1, 6, 7)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9. This forms the 3-star <3, (5, 7, 9)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. This forms the 3-star <6, (2, 8, 9)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8. This forms the 3-stars <9, (3, 5, 6)> and <9, (3, 5, 8)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, and <9, (3, 5, 6)>.
