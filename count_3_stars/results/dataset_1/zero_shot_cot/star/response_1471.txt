Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (2, 3, 6)>
4. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
5. <8, (0, 1, 4)>
6. <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
