Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (8, 9, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 0)>
<4, (1, 3, 1)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
