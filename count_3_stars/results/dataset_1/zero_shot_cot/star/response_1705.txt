Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (2, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (2, 8, 9)>
7. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
8. <9, (0, 1, 2)>
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
