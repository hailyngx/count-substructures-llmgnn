Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three nodes. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars. Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 1, 5)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 6, 3)>
<3, (6, 6, 2)>
<5, (7, 7, 1)>
<6, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 9, 1)>
<9, (1, 1, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
