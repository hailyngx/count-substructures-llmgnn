Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
3. <4, (6, 8, 8)>
4. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 2)>
6. <8, (1, 4, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
