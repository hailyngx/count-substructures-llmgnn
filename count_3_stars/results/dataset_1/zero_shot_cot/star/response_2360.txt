Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 8)
Node 1: (1, 0, 5)
Node 2: (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 7), (2, 7, 8)
Node 3: (3, 7, 8), (3, 7, 9), (3, 8, 9)
Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 0, 7)
Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 6), (5, 0, 7), (5, 1, 6), (5, 1, 7), (5, 2, 6), (5, 2, 7)
Node 6: (6, 0, 5), (6, 0, 9), (6, 5, 9)
Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 3), (7, 0, 4), (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 9), (7, 2, 3), (7, 2, 4), (7, 2, 5), (7, 2, 9), (7, 3, 9)
Node 8: (8, 0, 2), (8, 0, 3), (8, 0, 9), (8, 2, 3), (8, 2, 9), (8, 3, 9)
Node 9: (9, 3, 6), (9, 3, 7), (9, 3, 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
