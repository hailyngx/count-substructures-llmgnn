Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's list all the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 5)>
4. <5, (2, 8, 8)>
5. <7, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <8, (1, 5, 5)>
7. <9, (1, 1, 1)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars: [7].
