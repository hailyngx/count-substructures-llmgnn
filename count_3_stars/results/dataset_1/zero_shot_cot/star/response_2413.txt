Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
4. <4, (3, 7, 8)>
5. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
6. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
7. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
8. <8, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
