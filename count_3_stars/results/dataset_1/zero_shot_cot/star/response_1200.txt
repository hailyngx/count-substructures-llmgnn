Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a single node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 0, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
