Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all 3-stars. 
Given that a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by looking at each node and its adjacent nodes to see if they form any 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9)
   <0, (2, 3, 5)>
   <0, (2, 5, 9)>
   Total: 2 three-stars

2. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9)
   <2, (0, 5, 9)>
   Total: 1 three-star

3. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4)
   No 3-stars

4. Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 7)
   No 3-stars

5. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2)
   No 3-stars

6. Node 6: (6, 2)
   No 3-stars

7. Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9)
   <7, (4, 8, 9)>
   Total: 1 three-star

8. Node 8: (8, 7)
   No 3-stars

9. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 7)
   Total: 1 three-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, and <7, (4, 8, 9)>.
