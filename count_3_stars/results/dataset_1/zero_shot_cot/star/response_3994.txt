Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections in the graph:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
Node 2 is connected to node 6.
Node 3 is connected to node 9.
Node 4 is connected to node 7.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 9.
Node 7 is connected to node 4.
Node 8 is connected to node 5.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by looking at the connections from each node:

- Node 0 has no 3-star configurations because it is only connected to 2 other nodes.
- Node 2 has no 3-star configurations because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 3 has no 3-star configurations because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 4 has no 3-star configurations because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 7 has no 3-star configurations because it is only connected to 1 other node.
- Node 8 has no 3-star configurations because it is only connected to 1 other node.

Let's now identify the 3-star configurations for the remaining nodes:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (6, 8, 0)>.
- Node 6 forms two 3-star configurations: <6, (5, 9, 0)> and <6, (0, 5, 2)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star <9, (0, 6, 3)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<6, (0, 5, 2)>
<9, (0, 6, 3)>
