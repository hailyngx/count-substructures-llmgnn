Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three leaves, we will identify the nodes that have three edges connected to them. 

Let's go step by step to find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 has 2 edges connected to it.
2. Node 1 has 4 edges connected to it.
3. Node 2 has 5 edges connected to it. 

Hence, there are no possible 3-stars centered around nodes 0, 1, or 2 since they don't have exactly three edges connected to them.

4. Node 3 has 3 edges connected to it: (3, 2), (3, 6), and (3, 9). This forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 9)>.
5. Node 4 has 2 edges connected to it.
6. Node 5 has 2 edges connected to it.
7. Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it.
8. Node 7 has 5 edges connected to it.
9. Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it: (8, 2), (8, 7), and (8, 9). This forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 7, 9)>.
10. Node 9 has 6 edges connected to it.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>

Since we found two 3-stars in the graph, the final answer is [2].
