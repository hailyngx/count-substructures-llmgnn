Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 7, -)>

There are a total of [9] 3-star formations in the given graph.
