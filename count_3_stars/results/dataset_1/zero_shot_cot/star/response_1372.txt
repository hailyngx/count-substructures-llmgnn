Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we need to count the number of 3-stars.

To find all the 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list down the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, -)>
<2, (5, 7, -)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph inside brackets: [10].
