Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Step 2: For each identified node, check if it forms a 3-star with its three neighbors.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

Step 1: Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9.

Step 2: 
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 6. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, 4. <1, (0, 7, 4)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 8. <3, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it only has two neighbors.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, 9. <8, (3, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 4)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>.
