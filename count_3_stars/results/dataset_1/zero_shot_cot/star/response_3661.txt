Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the given graph, the central node can have between 0 and 3 edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 8, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
[4 unique 3-stars]

2. Central node 1:
<1, (0, 7, 3)>
[1 unique 3-star]

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5].
