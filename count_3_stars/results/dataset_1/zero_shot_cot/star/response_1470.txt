Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

1. Nodes connected to node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9)
   <0, (3, 5, 9)>

2. Nodes connected to node 1: (1, 3), (1, 8)
   <1, (3, 8)>

3. Nodes connected to node 2: (2, 3)
   <2, (3)>

4. Nodes connected to node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 9)
   <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>

5. Nodes connected to node 4: (4, 8), (4, 9)
   <4, (8, 9)>

6. Nodes connected to node 6: (6, 7), (6, 8)
   <6, (7, 8)>

7. Nodes connected to node 7: (7, 6), (7, 9)
   <7, (6, 9)>

8. Nodes connected to node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6)
   <8, (1, 4, 6)>

9. Nodes connected to node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)
   <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, 
   <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
