Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find the central node and the nodes connected to it. We can analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Analyzing node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.
- Possible 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- Degree: 6

Analyzing node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6.
- Possible 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- Degree: 4

Analyzing node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Possible 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- Degree: 7

Analyzing node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9.
- Possible 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- Degree: 6

Analyzing node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7.
- Possible 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- Degree: 4

Analyzing node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Possible 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, 4, 6, 7>
- Degree: 6

Analyzing node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5.
- Possible 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Degree: 4

Analyzing node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5.
- Possible 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (5, 2, 4)>
- Degree: 4

Analyzing node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5.
- Possible 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- Degree: 4

Analyzing node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5.
- Possible 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- Degree: 3

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<0, (4, 6, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 6)>,
<2, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<2, (3, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (3, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 6, 7)>,
