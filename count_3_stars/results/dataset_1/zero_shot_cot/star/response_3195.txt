Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with degrees.
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 7

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
- In a 3-star, the central node has degree 3.
- Therefore, we need to identify nodes with degree 3 and count the number of 3-stars around them.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars around each node with degree 3.

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 2)>
