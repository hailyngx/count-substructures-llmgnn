Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (6, 1, 4)>
- 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 5, 9)>
- 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
