Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 1, 6)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 6), (1, 9, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 4, 7), (2, 5, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 4, 7), (3, 9, 4)
- Node 4: (4, 2, 3), (4, 3, 7), (4, 6, 9)
- Node 5: (5, 2, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 1, 4), (6, 9, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 1, 9), (7, 2, 3), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 6), (8, 6, 9), (8, 7, 4)
- Node 9: (9, 1, 6), (9, 3, 4), (9, 4, 6), (9, 5, 2), (9, 6, 8)

Now we count the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 0)>
<1, (0, 6, 1)>, <1, (1, 9, 7)>
<2, (2, 4, 7)>, <2, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (3, 9, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 4)>, <4, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 6, 4)>, <6, (6, 0, 1)>, <6, (6, 9, 8)>
<7, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 9)>, <9, (6, 8, 9)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
