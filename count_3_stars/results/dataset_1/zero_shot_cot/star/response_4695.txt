Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of one center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center node. 

Let's go step-by-step to find and count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.

2. Check each node as a potential center node for a 3-star:
- For Node 0:
    - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- For Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- For Node 4:
    - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- For Node 5:
    - <5, (0, 2, 7)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 4 unique 3-stars as identified above.

Combine the identified 3-stars to get the final answer:

[4]  
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
