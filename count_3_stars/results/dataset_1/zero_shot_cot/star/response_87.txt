Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: Forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 3, and 8.
3. Node 2: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
4. Node 3: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 1 node.
5. Node 5: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
6. Node 6: Forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, and 9.
7. Node 7: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 1 node.
8. Node 8: Not part of any 3-star as it is connected to only 1 node.
9. Node 9: Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 1, and 6.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, and <6, (2, 5, 9)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
