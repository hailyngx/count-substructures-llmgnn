Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars.  
Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes in the given graph that have exactly three neighbors.  

In this graph, nodes 0, 3, and 6 have exactly three neighbors each.  

Step 2: Identify the leaves connected to the central nodes.  
For each central node identified in Step 1, we need to find the three nodes connected to it.  

For node 0, the neighbors are 2, 5, and 8.  
For node 3, the neighbors are 1, 2, and 5.  
For node 6, the neighbors are 5, 8, and 9.  

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.  
Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (2, 5, 8)>  
<3, (1, 2, 5)>  
<6, (5, 8, 9)>  

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
