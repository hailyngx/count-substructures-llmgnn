Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 8, 9
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 7
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 9
4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 8, 9
5. Node 4: Connected to node 8
6. Node 6: Connected to node 8, 9
7. Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 2
8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6
9. Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (8, 9)>
<6, (8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
