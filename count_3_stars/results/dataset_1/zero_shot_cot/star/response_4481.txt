Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars in the graph. The nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. 

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- The 3-star with center node 1 is <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- The 3-star with center node 2 is <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- The 3-star with center node 5 is <5, (1, 7, 8)>
- The 3-star with center node 7 is <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- The 3-star with center node 8 is <8, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
