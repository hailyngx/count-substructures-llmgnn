Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-star graphs:

<0, (8, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 9, 9)>
<2, (1, 1, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 3, 3)>
<5, (7, 8, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
