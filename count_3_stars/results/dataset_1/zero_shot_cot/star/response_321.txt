Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their connections for clarity:

Node 0: 1, 3, 7  
Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 8  
Node 2: 1, 3, 8  
Node 3: 0, 2  
Node 4: 5, 6  
Node 5: 1, 4, 6  
Node 6: 4, 5, 9  
Node 7: 0  
Node 8: 1, 2  
Node 9: 6  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
