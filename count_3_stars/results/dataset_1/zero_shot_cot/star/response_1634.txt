Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

The three-star patterns are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
