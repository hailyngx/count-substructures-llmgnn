Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 8, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
