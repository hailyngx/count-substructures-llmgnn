Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we start by checking each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it should be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After checking all nodes, we find the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 2, -)>
- <6, (2, 4, -)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (4, - , -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of 8, which can be shown as below:
