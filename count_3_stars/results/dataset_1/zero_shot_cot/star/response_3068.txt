Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 7)>
3. <2, (1, 8, 9)>
4. <3, (7, 9, -)>
5. <4, (6, -, -)>
6. <5, (0, 7, 8)>
7. <6, (4, 9, -)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (2, 5, -)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 2)>
11. <9, (3, 6, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [11].
