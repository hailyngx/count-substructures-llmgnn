Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them, as these nodes can be potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Node 0, 1, 5, and 6 have exactly three edges connected to them. Now, let's construct all possible 3-stars using these nodes:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 7, 9)>
3. <5, (0, 3, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
