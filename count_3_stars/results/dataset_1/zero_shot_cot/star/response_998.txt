Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node and the connected nodes for each 3-star pattern.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Start by identifying the possible central nodes in the graph based on the edges connected to them:
   - Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
   - Node 2 has edges with nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
   - Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
   - Node 5 has edges with nodes 0 and 2.
   - Node 6 has edges with nodes 2 and 3.
   - Node 7 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
   - Node 9 has an edge with node 7.
   
2. Count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
   - For node 0: No 3-stars because it only has 4 neighbors.
   - For node 2: No 3-stars because it only has 4 neighbors.
   - For node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (2, 0, 1)> (5 3-stars in total).
   - For node 5: No 3-stars because it only has 2 neighbors.
   - For node 6: No 3-stars because it only has 2 neighbors.
   - For node 7: No 3-stars because it only has 4 neighbors.
   - For node 9: No 3-stars because it only has 1 neighbor.

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
   - Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the final answer is: [5].

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (2, 0, 1)>
