This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
    
    <1, (3, 8, 8)>
    <2, (3, 4, 5)>
    <3, (1, 2, 8)>
    <4, (2, 5, 5)>
    <5, (2, 3, 4)>
