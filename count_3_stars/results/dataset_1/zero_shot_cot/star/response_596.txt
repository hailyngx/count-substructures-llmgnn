Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
    - <0, (6, 8)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
    - <1, (2, 6)>

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
    - <2, (1, 3)>

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
    - <3, (2, 5)>

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
    - <5, (3, 6, 8)>

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
    - <6, (0, 1, 5)>

7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
    - <8, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, we found 7 unique 3-stars in the graph.
The final answer is [7].
