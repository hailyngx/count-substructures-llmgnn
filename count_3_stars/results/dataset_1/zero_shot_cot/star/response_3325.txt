Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 1.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 0.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and none.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and none.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 0)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, none)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (6, 7, none)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
