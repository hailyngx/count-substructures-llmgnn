Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:
1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors 1, 3, and 9.
   - Node 1 has neighbors 0, 2, and 4.
   - Node 2 has neighbors 1, 7, and 9.
   - Node 3 has neighbors 0, 4, and 9.
   - Node 4 has neighbors 1, 3, and additional neighbors 6 and 8. (Not a 3-star)
   - Node 5 has neighbors 6 and 8. (Not a 3-star)
   - Node 6 has neighbors 4 and 5. (Not a 3-star)
   - Node 7 has neighbors 2 and 8. (Not a 3-star)
   - Node 8 has neighbors 4, 5, 7, and 9. (Not a 3-star)
   - Node 9 has neighbors 0, 2, and 3.

2. Count the number of 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
   - There are 4 instances of 3-stars: 
     <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
