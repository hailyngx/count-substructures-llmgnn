Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, we identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 0, 5
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 6)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
9. <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
