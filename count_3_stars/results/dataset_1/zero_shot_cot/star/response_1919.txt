Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To identify the 3-star graph in the given network, let's first identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be central nodes of potential 3-stars. 

Looking at the given edges, the potential central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 9, and no other node

Next, we will construct the 3-stars with each of these potential central nodes and their connected nodes. 

The 3-star graphs are:
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given network is [3].
