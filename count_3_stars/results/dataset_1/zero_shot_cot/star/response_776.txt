Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to determine the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Central node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
2. Central node 1 is connected to nodes 2.
3. Central node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Central node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
5. Central node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
6. Central node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
7. Central node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 7.
8. Central node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
9. Central node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5.
10. Central node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
