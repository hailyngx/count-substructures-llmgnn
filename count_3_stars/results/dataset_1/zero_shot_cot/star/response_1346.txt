Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors
    - Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
    - Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 5, 7
    - Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 7, 9
    - Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 1
    - Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4
    - Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 9
    - Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9
    - Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 7, 8

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars
    - From the identified nodes, we see that nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9 have exactly three neighbors each. 
    - We can form a 3-star around each of these nodes. 

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars
    <0, (1, 3, 5)>
    <4, (2, 6, 7)>
    <7, (1, 8, 9)>
    <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Step 4: Count the total number of unique 3-stars
