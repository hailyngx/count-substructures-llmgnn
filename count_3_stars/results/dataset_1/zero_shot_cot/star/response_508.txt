Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in total.
