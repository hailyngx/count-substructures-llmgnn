Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the central node with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-star graphs. 

Nodes connected to 0: 1, 5, 9
Nodes connected to 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
Nodes connected to 2: 4, 6, 7, 9
Nodes connected to 3: 1, 6, 8, 9
Nodes connected to 4: 1, 2, 6, 7
Nodes connected to 5: 0, 9
Nodes connected to 6: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
Nodes connected to 7: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
Nodes connected to 8: 3, 7
Nodes connected to 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. <6, (2, 3, 4)>
7. <7, (1, 2, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
