Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 3)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 3)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1)
5. Node 6: (6, 1, 2)
6. Node 8: (8, 2, 6)

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (2, 3, -)>  
<1, (2, 3, -)>  
<2, (0, 1, -)>  
<3, (0, 1, -)>  
<6, (1, 2, -)>  
<8, (2, 6, -)>
