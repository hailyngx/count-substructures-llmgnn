Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 4, -)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
