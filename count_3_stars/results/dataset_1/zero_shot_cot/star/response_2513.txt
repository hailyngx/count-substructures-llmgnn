Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:  
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3.  
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5.  
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4.  
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5.  
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4.  
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3.  

Hence, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 2, 3)>  
<1, (0, 4, 5)>  
<2, (0, 3, 4)>  
<3, (0, 2, 5)>  
<5, (1, 3, 4)>  
<8, (0, 1, 3)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
