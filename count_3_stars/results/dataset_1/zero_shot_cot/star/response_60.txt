Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- For node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 9)
- For node 1: (1, 0, 7)
- For node 2: (2, 3, 6)
- For node 4: (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 8), (4, 5, 8)
- For node 5: (5, 0, 4), (5, 0, 8), (5, 4, 8)
- For node 6: (6, 2, 3), (6, 2, 8), (6, 3, 8)
- For node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 2), (7, 0, 9)
- For node 8: (8, 4, 5), (8, 4, 6), (8, 5, 6), (8, 6, 9)
- For node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 7), (9, 0, 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is 18. 

So, the answer is [18].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7)>
<2, (3, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
