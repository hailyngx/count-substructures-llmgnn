Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

We can see that the nodes with their corresponding degree are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 0:
As node 0 has degree 2, it cannot be the center of any 3-star.

2. For node 1:
As node 1 has degree 1, it cannot be the center of any 3-star.

3. For node 2:
Node 2 has degree 4, so it can be the center of a 3-star. The possibilities are:
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
Hence, there are 2 possibilities for 3-stars with center at node 2.

4. For node 3:
Node 3 has degree 4, so it can be the center of a 3-star. The only possibility is:
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
Hence, there is 1 possibility for a 3-star with center at node 3.

5. For node 4:
Node 4 has degree 3, so it can be the center of a 3-star. The only possibility is:
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
Hence, there is 1 possibility for a 3-star with center at node 4.

6. For node 5:
As node 5 has degree 2, it cannot be the center of any 3-star.

7. For node 6:
Node 6 has degree 3, so it can be the center of a 3-star. The only possibility is:
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>
Hence, there is 1 possibility for a 3-star with center at node 6.

8. For node 7:
Node 7 has degree 4, so it can be the center of a 3-star. The only possibility is:
- <7, (2, 3, 4)>
Hence, there is 1 possibility for a 3-star with center at node 7.

9. For node 8:
Node 8 has degree 5, so it can be the center of a 3-star. The possibilities are:
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
Hence, there are 4 possibilities for 3-stars with center at node 8.

10. For node 9:
As node 9 has degree 1, it cannot be the center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 9.

So, the final answer is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
