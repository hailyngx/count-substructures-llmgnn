Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find and count the 3-stars.

1. Check each node to see if it is a central node with three connected nodes.
2. List out the possible 3-stars.

Here are the 3-star patterns found in the given graph:
- <0, (8, 9, x)>
- <2, (9, x, x)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (5, 8, x)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
