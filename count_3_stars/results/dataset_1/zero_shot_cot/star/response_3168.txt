Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars:

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 0:
    - None because node 0 is connected to only two other nodes (3 and 7).

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 1:
    - None because node 1 is connected to only two other nodes (2 and 8).

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 2:
    - One <2, (1, 4, 9)>

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 3:
    - Two <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 4:
    - None because node 4 is connected to only one other node (2).

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 5:
    - None because node 5 is connected to only two other nodes (3 and 7).

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 6:
    - None because node 6 is connected to only one other node (3).

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 7:
    - None because node 7 is connected to only two other nodes (0 and 5).

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 8:
    - None because node 8 is connected to only two other nodes (1 and 9).

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 9:
    - None because node 9 is connected to only two other nodes (2 and 3).

Thus, there are a total of <2, (1, 4, 9)> and two instances of <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
