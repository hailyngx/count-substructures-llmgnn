Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Given the information provided:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars from the given information:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
