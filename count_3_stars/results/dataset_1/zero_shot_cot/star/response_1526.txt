Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we analyze the given graph to find the 3-stars.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have three edges connected to them.

From the provided edges, we can see that:
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 9)
- Node 3 has 3 edges connected to it: (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6)
- Node 4 has 3 edges connected to it: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 9)
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
