Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There is a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
