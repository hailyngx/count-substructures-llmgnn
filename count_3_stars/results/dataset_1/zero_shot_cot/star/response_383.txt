Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9. (<1, (2, 8, 9)>)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 1. (<2, (6, 8, 1)>)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5. (<3, (0, 4, 5)>)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3. (<4, (0, 1, 3)>)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9. (<5, (3, 7, 9)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 8, and 9. (<6, (2, 8, 9)>)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9. (<7, (2, 5, 9)>)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6. (<8, (1, 2, 6)>)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6. (<9, (1, 5, 6)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
