Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's denote the nodes with their connections in a more simplified way: 

0: 3, 5, 7  
1: 2, 9  
2: 1, 5, 9  
3: 0  
5: 0, 2, 7, 8  
6: 8  
7: 0, 5, 9  
8: 5, 6  
9: 1, 2, 7  

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:  
1. The possible 3-stars will have the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.  
2. By examining the connections, we can find all the unique 3-stars.  

The list of unique 3-stars <center node, (leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)> is:  
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<1, (2, 9, 0)>  
<2, (1, 5, 9)>  
<3, (0)>  
<5, (0, 2, 7)>  
<7, (0, 5, 9)>  
<8, (6, 5)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
