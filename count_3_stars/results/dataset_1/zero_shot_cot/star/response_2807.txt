Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-star configurations. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges in the graph, we can see that nodes 8 and 9 can act as central nodes, as they are connected to exactly three other nodes each.

Now let's list down all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <8, (0, 1, 3)>
2. <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
