Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star.
Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars based on the given edges:

<0, (7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 7)>
<3, (9)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1)>
<9, (1, 3, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
