Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edge list:

- For node 0: (0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 8) <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9) <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9) <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- For node 3: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 9) <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- For node 4: (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 9) <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9) <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- For node 6: (6, 2) <6, (2, 8, 3)>
- For node 7: (7, 5) <7, (5, 0, 1)>
- For node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5) <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- For node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5) <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Now, we need to count the number of unique 3-stars. As some 3-stars are duplicated, we only count them once.

Count of unique 3-stars: [9]
