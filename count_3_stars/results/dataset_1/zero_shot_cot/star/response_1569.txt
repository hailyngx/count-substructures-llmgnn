Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list all the potential 3-stars based on the given edges:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<0, (6, 1, 2)>
<1, (0, 6, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 0, 6)>
<2, (6, 0, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 0, 6)>
<4, (6, 0, 2)>
<4, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 0, 4)>
<6, (2, 0, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 0)>
<6, (2, 0, 9)>
<6, (4, 0, 2)>
<6, (4, 2, 0)>
<6, (4, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 6, 2)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 3)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 0, 2)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The answer is [29].
