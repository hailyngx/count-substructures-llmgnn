Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 9)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
