Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 2, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
