Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph.

From the given edge list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- 3-star with center 0: (0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9)
- 3-star with center 1: (1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)
- 3-star with center 2: (2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)
- 3-star with center 3: (3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found and output it inside brackets:

[4]

And list the unique 3-stars found inside angle brackets <>, each only once:

<0, (1, 3, 5, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9)>
