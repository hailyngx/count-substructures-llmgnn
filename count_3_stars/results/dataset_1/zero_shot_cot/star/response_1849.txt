Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 2, 4, 5
    - Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
    - Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 6, 7
    - Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 1, 6, 9
    - Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes: 0, 7
    - Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4
    - Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes: 1, 3
    - Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 3, 4

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
    - Node 0 forms <0, (1, 4, 5)>
    - Node 1 forms <1, (0, 6, 8)> and <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    - Node 2 forms <2, (0, 6, 7)>
    - Node 4 forms <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    - Node 6 forms <6, (1, 2, 3)> and <6, (1, 4, 6)>
    - Node 9 forms <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Final Answer: [6]
