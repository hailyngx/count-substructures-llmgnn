Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
   - <0, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
   Total count for Node 0: 5

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 1.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
   - <2, (0, 4, 7)>
   Total count for Node 2: 1

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
   - <3, (0, 4, 7)>
   Total count for Node 3: 1

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7.
   - <4, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <4, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
   Total count for Node 4: 4

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 5.

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
   - No new 3-stars centered at Node 7.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 8.

9. Node 9 is connected to node 5.
   - No 3-stars centered at Node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, and <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
