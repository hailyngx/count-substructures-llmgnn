Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 3, 4, 5
Node 1: 4, 6
Node 2: 4, 5, 8
Node 3: 0, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7
Node 5: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 6: 1, 3, 8
Node 7: 4, 5
Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 6
Node 9: 5

Step 2: Find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph.
