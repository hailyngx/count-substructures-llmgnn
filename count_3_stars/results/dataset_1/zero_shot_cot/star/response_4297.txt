Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the edges provided.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, )>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>

Let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9].
