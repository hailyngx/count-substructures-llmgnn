Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5: <0, (2, 3, 5)>
  
Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to node 4: No 3-star formed with node 1 as the center.

Moving on to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9: <2, (0, 6, 9)>

Moving on to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9: <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>

Moving on to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8: <4, (1, 7, 8)>

Moving on to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9: <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>

Moving on to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3: No 3-star formed with node 6 as the center.

Moving on to node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8: <7, (4, 5, 8)>

Moving on to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7: <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Moving on to node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5: <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
