Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine which nodes are connected to each other and then identify the 3-stars. 

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:

Nodes connected to node 0: 4, 6, 7
Nodes connected to node 1: 2, 4, 6, 9
Nodes connected to node 2: 1, 6
Nodes connected to node 3: 5, 6, 9
Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
Nodes connected to node 5: 3, 4, 9
Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
Nodes connected to node 7: 0, 4, 6
Nodes connected to node 8: 4
Nodes connected to node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

[]
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
