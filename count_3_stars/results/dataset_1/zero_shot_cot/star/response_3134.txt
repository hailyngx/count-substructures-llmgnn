Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

The nodes in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs based on the definition provided earlier:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
  - <0, (2, 9)>

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5
  - <2, (0, 5)>

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6
  - <4, (3, 6)>

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 9
  - <7, (8, 9)>

Therefore, the count of 3-star subgraphs in this graph is [4].
The unique 3-star subgraphs are: <0, (2, 9)>, <2, (0, 5)>, <4, (3, 6)>, <7, (8, 9)>.
