Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as those are potential central nodes of 3-stars.
In this graph, the nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 8, 9
Next, let's check the neighbors of each of these nodes and find any 3-stars.
Starting with node 1:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 7, 8, 9
- This forms a 3-star: <1, (7, 8, 9)>

Moving on to node 8:
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 9
- No 3-star is formed with node 8 as the central node.

Finally, for node 9:
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 5, 8
- No 3-star is formed with node 9 as the central node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <1, (7, 8, 9)>.
