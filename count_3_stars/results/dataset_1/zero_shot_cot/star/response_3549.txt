Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (0, 3, 7)>

From the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
