Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (1, 8, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 6, 8)
- Node 2: (6, 7, 9)
- Node 3: No 3-star as it only has 2 connections.
- Node 4: (3, 6, 7)
- Node 5: No 3-star as it only has 2 connections.
- Node 6: (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 6), (2, 4, 7), (2, 6, 9), (4, 6, 7), (6, 7, 9)
- Node 7: No 3-star as it only has 2 connections.
- Node 8: No 3-star as it only has 3 connections.
- Node 9: No 3-star as it only has 3 connections.

Finally, calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
- There are 4 unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>.
- So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
