Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to node 0:
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.

<0, (1, 6, 8)>

Step 2: Identify the nodes connected to node 1:
- Node 0 is connected to node 1.
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.

<1, (0, 5, 8)>

Step 3: Identify the nodes connected to node 2:
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

<2, (3, 4, 5)>

Step 4: Identify the nodes connected to node 8:
- Node 0 is connected to node 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Step 5: Count the number of unique 3-stars found: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
