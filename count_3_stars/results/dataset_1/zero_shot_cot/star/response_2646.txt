Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We first identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {3}
- Node 2: {3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, let's look for the 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
