Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars.

First, let's list out the nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 4, 7
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 3, 4
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (6, 1, 5)>
<1, (6, 0, 5)>
<2, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 7)>
<4, (3, 8, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 0)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (3, 4, 4)>
<8, (4, 9, 4)>
<9, (8, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
