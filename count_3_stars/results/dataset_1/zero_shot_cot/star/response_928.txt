Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
