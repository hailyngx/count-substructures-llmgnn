Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. The central nodes must have exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, the central nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: neighbors (3, 4, 8)
- Node 1: neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 2: neighbors (1, 3, 8, 9)
- Node 3: neighbors (0, 2, 4)
- Node 4: neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6)
- Node 8: neighbors (0, 1, 2, 5)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
