Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Start by listing all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

2. Look for 3-stars by considering each node as the center:
- For node 0: There are no 3-stars centered around node 0.
- For node 2: There is one 3-star <2, (0, 7, 8)>.
- For node 3: There is one 3-star <3, (2, 5, 7)>.
- For node 4: There are no 3-stars centered around node 4.
- For node 5: There are no 3-stars centered around node 5.
- For node 6: There are no 3-stars centered around node 6.
- For node 7: There is one 3-star <7, (0, 2, 5)>.
- For node 8: There are no 3-stars centered around node 8.
- For node 9: There are no 3-stars centered around node 9.

3. Final count: 
- Number of 3-stars: [3]

4. Unique 3-stars:
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
