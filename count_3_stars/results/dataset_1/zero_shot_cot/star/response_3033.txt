Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. For node 1:
    - (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9)
    <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    <1, (4, 5, 8)>
    <1, (4, 5, 9)>
    <1, (5, 6, 8)>
    <1, (5, 6, 9)>
    <1, (5, 8, 9)>
    <1, (6, 8, 9)>
    
2. For node 2:
    - (2, 5), (2, 9)
    <2, (5, 9)>

3. For node 3:
    - (3, 0), (3, 7)
    <3, (0, 7)>
    
4. For node 4:
    - (4, 1)
    <4, (1, 5, 6)>
    
5. For node 5:
    - (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9)
    <5, (1, 2, 8)>
    <5, (1, 2, 9)>
    <5, (1, 8, 9)>
    <5, (2, 8, 9)>
    
6. For node 6:
    - (6, 1)

7. For node 7:
    - (7, 3), (7, 8)
    <7, (3, 8)>
    
8. For node 8:
    - (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7)
    <8, (1, 5, 7)>
    <8, (1, 5, 9)>
    
9. For node 9:
    - (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5)
    <9, (1, 2, 5)>
    <9, (1, 5, 8)>
    <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [16].
