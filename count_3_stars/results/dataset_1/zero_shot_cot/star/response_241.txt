Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
At first, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can check each node to see if it satisfies this condition.

Nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 6. Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 5 and 7. Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 6 and 9. Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 9: Connected to node 4. Does not form a 3-star.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
