Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 8, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 4)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars listed above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
