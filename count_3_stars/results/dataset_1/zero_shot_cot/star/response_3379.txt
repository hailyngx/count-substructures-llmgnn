Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8: <0, (4, 5, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9: <6, (5, 7, 9)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <7, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
