Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1, node 2, and node 3 respectively:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 1: <1, (3, 6)>
- For node 2: <2, (6, 8)>
- For node 3: <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 6)>, <2, (6, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>.
