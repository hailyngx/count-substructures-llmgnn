Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars based on the given information. 

<0, (2, 3, x)>
<1, (2, 9, x)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, x)>
<2, (4, 7, x)>
<2, (7, 8, x)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 9, x)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, x)>
<9, (4, 5, x)>

Now, we will count the number of unique 3-stars.
