Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify Central Nodes - Find all nodes that have exactly three neighbors.
Central nodes: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Step 2: For each central node, identify the connected leaves and form 3-stars.
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
