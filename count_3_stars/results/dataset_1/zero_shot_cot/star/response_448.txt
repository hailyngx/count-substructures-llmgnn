Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3
   - Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
   - Node 5: connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   2. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
   3. <5, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
