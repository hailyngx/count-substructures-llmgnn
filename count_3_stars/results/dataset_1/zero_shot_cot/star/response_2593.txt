Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. We will then confirm if they form a 3-star pattern.

For the given graph, we have the following nodes with three neighbors:

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 6}

Thus, there are 3-stars centered at nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9. We can list them as follows:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<6, (1, 9)>
<9, (1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
