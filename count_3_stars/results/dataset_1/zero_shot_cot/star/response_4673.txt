Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node as the center in turn:

1. For node 0:
   - It forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8: <0, (2, 4, 8)>

2. For node 2:
   - It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8: <2, (0, 3, 8)>

3. For node 3:
   - It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <3, (0, 4, 5)>

4. For node 4:
   - It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9: <4, (0, 3, 9)>

5. For node 5:
   - It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 8: <5, (3, 6, 8)>

6. For node 6: 
   - It does not form a 3-star.

7. For node 7: 
   - It does not form a 3-star.

8. For node 8:
   - It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <8, (0, 2, 5)>

9. For node 9: 
   - It does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.
