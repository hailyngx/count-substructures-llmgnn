Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected leaves for each 3-star. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
5. <4, (3, 8)>
6. <5, (3)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 9)>
8. <7, (2, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 2, 4, 7)>
10. <9, (2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
