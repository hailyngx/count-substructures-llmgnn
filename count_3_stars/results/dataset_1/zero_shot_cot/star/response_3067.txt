Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Each combination will form a unique 3-star.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
