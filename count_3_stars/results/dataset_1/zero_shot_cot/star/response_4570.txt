Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6: <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 8: <8, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and provide the final answer within brackets:

[10]
