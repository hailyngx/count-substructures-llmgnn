Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 10 nodes and 30 edges. To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the potential 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 8, -)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <3, (2, 7, -)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
6. <5, (4, 9, -)>
7. <6, (2, -, -)>
8. <7, (2, 3, -)>
9. <8, (1, 2, 4)>
10. <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Count the unique 3-stars mentioned above:
