Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 5
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 3
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 3

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 3)>
<8, (2, 5)>
<9, (2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
