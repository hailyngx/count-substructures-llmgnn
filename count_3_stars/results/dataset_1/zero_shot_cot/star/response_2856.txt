Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
We will now count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's list down the possible 3-stars in the graph, following the definition of a 3-star graph.
- For node 0: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- For node 1: <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- For node 2: <2, (1, 5, 0)>
- For node 4: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- For node 5: < 5, (2, 9, 0)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. []

As for the uniqueness requirement, we have already listed each unique 3-star only once inside <> brackets.
