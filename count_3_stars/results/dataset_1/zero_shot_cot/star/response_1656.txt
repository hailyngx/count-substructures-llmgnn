Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[3]
