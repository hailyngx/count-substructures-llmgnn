Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, with one of the nodes acting as the central node.

Looking at the provided edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
7. <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
