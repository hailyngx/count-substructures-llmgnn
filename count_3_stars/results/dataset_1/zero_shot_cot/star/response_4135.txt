Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and count them. 

Let's first list all the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
```
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (7, 8, -)>
<3, (8, 9, -)>
<4, (9, -, -)>
<5, (6, -, -)>
```
Next, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
```
[6]
```
