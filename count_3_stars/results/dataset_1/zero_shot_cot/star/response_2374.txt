Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.  
Based on the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:  
Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, 9)  
Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, 8)  
Node 4 (connected to nodes 3, 6, 9)  
Node 6 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8)  

Step 2: For each identified center node, count the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed.  
Node 0:  
Possible 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 5, 7)>  
<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
[2]  

Node 3:  
Possible 3-stars:  
<3, (0, 4, 6)>  
<3, (1, 4, 8)>  
[2]  

Node 4:  
Possible 3-stars:  
<4, (3, 6, 9)>  
[1]  

Node 6:  
Possible 3-stars:  
<6, (2, 3, 8)>  
<6, (4, 3, 8)>  
[2]  

Step 3: Sum up the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.  
Total number of 3-stars: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7  

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
