Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes and their connections can be visualized as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[There are 13 3-stars in the graph.]

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<(1, 3, 8)>
<(1, 4, 8)>
<(1, 8, 9)>
<(3, 4, 8)>
<(8, 9, 5)>
