Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

From the given edges, the nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8)

Now, let's list the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <4, (2, 5, 6)>
3. <5, (0, 4, 7)>
4. <6, (2, 3, 8)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [4].
