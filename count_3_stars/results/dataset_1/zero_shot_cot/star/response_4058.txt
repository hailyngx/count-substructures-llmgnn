Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [4]
