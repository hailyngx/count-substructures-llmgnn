Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
