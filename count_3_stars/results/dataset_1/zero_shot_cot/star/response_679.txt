Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all such 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, -)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, -)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (3, 8, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
