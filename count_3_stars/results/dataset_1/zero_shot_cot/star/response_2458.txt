Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be determined as follows:

- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, each node can be a potential central node for a 3-star.
- For each potential central node, we need to count the number of 3-stars around it. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: No 3-stars since it has only one edge connecting it to Node 6.
- Node 1: Two 3-stars, one with (1, 4, 7) and the other with (1, 3, 9).
- Node 2: No 3-stars since it has only one edge connecting it to Node 9.
- Node 3: No 3-stars since it has multiple edges but none of them forms a 3-star.
- Node 4: No 3-stars since it has multiple edges but none of them forms a 3-star.
- Node 5: No 3-stars since it has only one edge connecting it to Node 6.
- Node 6: One 3-star with (6, 3, 5).
- Node 7: No 3-stars since it has multiple edges but none of them forms a 3-star.
- Node 8: No 3-stars since it has multiple edges but none of them forms a 3-star.
- Node 9: One 3-star with (9, 1, 2).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
