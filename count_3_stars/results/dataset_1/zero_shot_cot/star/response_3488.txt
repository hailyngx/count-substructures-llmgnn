Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 9, 3)>
2. <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 3, 8)>
5. <7, (1, 3, 8)>
6. <9, (0, 1, 2)>
