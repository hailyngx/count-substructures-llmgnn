Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 9, -)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, - , -)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [9]
