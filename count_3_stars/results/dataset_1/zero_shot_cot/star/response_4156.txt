Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to each node.  
Nodes connected to node 0: 2, 5, 6, 7  
Nodes connected to node 1: 5  
Nodes connected to node 2: 0, 3, 4  
Nodes connected to node 3: 2  
Nodes connected to node 4: 2  
Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 1  
Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 8, 9  
Nodes connected to node 7: 0, 8  
Nodes connected to node 8: 6, 7  
Nodes connected to node 9: 6  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.  
To find a 3-star, we need to look for a node connected to exactly three other nodes (a central node connected to three leaves). 

From the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes (2, 5, 6, 7), which forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 6)>.
- Node 6 is also connected to 3 nodes (0, 8, 9), which forms another 3-star: <6, (0, 8, 9)>.

Step 3: Output the final answer.  
[2]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
