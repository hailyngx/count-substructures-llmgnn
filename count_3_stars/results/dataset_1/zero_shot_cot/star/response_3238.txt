Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central node of a 3-star graph will have exactly three edges connected to it. Looking at the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 2 are the central nodes since they each have three incident edges.

Next, we need to find the leaves connected to each central node. The leaves are the nodes that share an edge with the central node but are not connected to each other.

For central node 0:
- Leaves: 3, 4, 6 (<0, (3, 4, 6)>)

For central node 1:
- Leaves: 2, 3, 4 (<1, (2, 3, 4)>)

For central node 2:
- Leaves: 1, 3, 5 (<2, (1, 3, 5)>)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
