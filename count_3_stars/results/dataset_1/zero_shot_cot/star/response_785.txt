Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three nodes connected to it. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can see that the central nodes can be either 2, 3, 7, or 8. Let's explore each possible central node:

1. For node 2:
    - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 7)>
    Total = 4

2. For node 3:
    - <3, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <3, (2, 5, 6)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 2)>
    Total = 3

3. For node 7:
    - <7, (2, 4, 9)>
    - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
    Total = 2

4. For node 8:
    - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 7, 9)>
    Total = 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].  
The unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.
