Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list down the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 8)>
<6, (0, 0, 0)>
<7, (9, 9, -)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
