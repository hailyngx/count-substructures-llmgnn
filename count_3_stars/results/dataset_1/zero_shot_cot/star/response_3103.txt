Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
3. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
4. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
6. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
7. <4, (5, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7].
