Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 5, 6)
4. Node 3: (3, 4, 6)
5. Node 5: (5, 0, 2)
6. Node 6: (6, 2, 3)
7. Node 7: (7, 3, 5)
8. Node 9: (9, 0, 1)

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 
<0, (5, 9, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 1)>, <2, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>.
