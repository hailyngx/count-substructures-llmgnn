Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Nodes: 0, 1, 2 form a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, -)>
2. Nodes: 2, 3, 9 form a 3-star: <2, (3, 9, -)>
3. Nodes: 2, 4, 5 form a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, -)>
4. Nodes: 2, 6, 7 form a 3-star: <2, (6, 7, -)>
5. Nodes: 3, 1, 9 form a 3-star: <3, (1, 9, -)>
6. Nodes: 3, 2, 4 form a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, -)>
7. Nodes: 4, 5, 7 form a 3-star: <4, (5, 7, -)>
8. Nodes: 7, 6, 9 form a 3-star: <7, (6, 9, -)>

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8.]
