Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique set of 3 nodes that form a 3-star. 
Here's the step-by-step way to do this:

1. First, list all the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:
    - Node 1 has 6 edges
    - Node 4 has 5 edges
    - Node 5 has 4 edges
    - Node 6 has 4 edges
    - Node 8 has 4 edges

2. For each of these nodes, check if the connected nodes form a 3-star. 
    - For Node 1: (0, 1, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 6), and (1, 6, 8)
    - For Node 4: (0, 1, 4), (2, 4, 6), (4, 5, 6), and (4, 6, 8)
    - For Node 5: (1, 2, 5), (4, 5, 6), and (5, 6, 7)
    - For Node 6: (1, 5, 6), (2, 4, 6), and (5, 6, 9)
    - For Node 8: (1, 6, 8), (4, 6, 8), and (7, 8, 1)

3. Count the unique 3-stars from the above combinations:
    <0, (1, 4, 0)>, <1, (2, 5, 1)>, <1, (5, 6, 1)>, <1, (6, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 6, 4)>, <5, (6, 7, 5)>, <6, (9, 6, 5)>, <7, (8, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
