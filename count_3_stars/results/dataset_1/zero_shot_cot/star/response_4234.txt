Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 - 3-star with leaves 4, 6, 7. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. Node 2 - 3-star with leaves 3, 4, 6. <2, (3, 4, 6)>
3. Node 4 - 3-star with leaves 0, 2, 3. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
4. Node 6 - 3-star with leaves 0, 2, 4. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
5. Node 7 - 3-star with leaves 0, 4, 8. <7, (0, 4, 8)>
6. Node 8 - 3-star with leaves 0, 2, 7. <8, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
