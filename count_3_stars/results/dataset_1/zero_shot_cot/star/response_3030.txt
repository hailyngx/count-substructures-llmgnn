Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which will represent the centers of the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to 0, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 3, 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by considering each center node:

1. 3-star centered at Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. 3-star centered at Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 9)>
3. 3-star centered at Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 9)>
4. 3-star centered at Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
