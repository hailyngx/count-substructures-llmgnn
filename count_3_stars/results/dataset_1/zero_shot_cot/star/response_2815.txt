Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars. 
Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 3, 4
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>

2. Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 3, 4, 5
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (3, 4, 5)>

3. Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 3, 4
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>

4. Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 1, 2
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 1, 2)>

5. Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 1, 7
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 7)>

6. Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 2, 7
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 2, 7)>

7. Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 7, 8
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (2, 7, 8)>

8. Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 5, 6
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (4, 5, 6)>

9. Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes: 6, 7, 9
    - Possible 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (6, 7, 9)>

10. Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes: 7, 8
    - Node 9 cannot form a 3-star as it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes.


Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
