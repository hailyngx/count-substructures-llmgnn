Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern). Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes with their connections:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 5 and 8
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
   - Node 2: Connected to node 4
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 2 and 9
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 4 and 8

2. Based on the connections mentioned, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 8)>
   - Count of 3-stars: [1]
