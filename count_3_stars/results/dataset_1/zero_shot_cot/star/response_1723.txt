Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 
A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all possible 3-stars based on the given edges:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
