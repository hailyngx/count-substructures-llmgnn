Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with three edges:
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 has edges to nodes 2, 8, and 9.

Step 2: Find 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
- There are [2] 3-stars in the graph: <0, (1, 2, 4)> and <7, (2, 8, 9)>.
