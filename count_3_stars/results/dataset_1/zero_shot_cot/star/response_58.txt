Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars.

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 4 unique 3-stars found: 
1. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 9, 6)>
3. <2, (3, 6, 7)>
4. <6, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
