Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to three other nodes:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.

2. Putting the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
   - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
   - <2, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 6)>

3. Counting the unique 3-stars found:
   - [4]

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [4]
