Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected directly to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.

Now, for each node, we can determine if it is the center of a 3-star graph by checking if it is connected to exactly three nodes. In this case, nodes 0, 3, 5, 7 are not centers of 3-star graphs.

The centers of 3-star graphs in this graph are nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
