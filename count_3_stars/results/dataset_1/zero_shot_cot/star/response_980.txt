Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 0)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
