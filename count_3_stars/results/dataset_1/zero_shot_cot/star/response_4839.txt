Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 2 has edges to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
   - Node 7 has edges to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
   - Node 8 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 9.

2. Count the 3-stars formed by these nodes:
   - From the above analysis, there are three 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
