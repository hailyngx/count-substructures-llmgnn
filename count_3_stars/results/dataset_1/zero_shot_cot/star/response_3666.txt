Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 7)>
3. <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
5. <4, (2, 6, 8)>
6. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
7. <7, (1, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (2, 8, 9)>
9. <9, (3, 6, 7)>
10. <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
