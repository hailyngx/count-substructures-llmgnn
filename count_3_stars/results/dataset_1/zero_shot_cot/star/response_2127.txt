Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. For node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
    - <0, (1, 4, 5)>

2. For node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
    - <1, (0, 6, 7)>

3. For node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
    - <6, (1, 7, 8)>

4. For node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
    - <7, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (2, 9, 3)>

5. The final count of 3-stars is [5].
   
Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, and <7, (2, 9, 3)>.
