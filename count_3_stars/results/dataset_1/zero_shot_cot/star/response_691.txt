Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 1, 2)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>
<2, (7, 0, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 3, 3)>
<6, (3, 8, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

Since each 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars is [8].
