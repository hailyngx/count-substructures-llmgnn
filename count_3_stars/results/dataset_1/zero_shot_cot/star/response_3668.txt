Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (4, 6, 8)>
7. <6, (0, 5, 9)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 4)>
9. <8, (5, 6, 7)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
