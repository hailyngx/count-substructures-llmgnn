Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes where each node is connected:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form 3-stars with (1, 8, 9), (2, 6, 7), and (6, 8, 9).
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with (0, 8, 9).
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with (0, 6, 7).
- Node 3 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 3-stars with (0, 8, 9) and (2, 0, 7).
- Node 7 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 8 cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 cannot form a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
