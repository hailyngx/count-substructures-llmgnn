Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances in which a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
