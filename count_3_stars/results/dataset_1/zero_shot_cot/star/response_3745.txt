Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars using the given edges:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, -)>
<5, (4, 7, -)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, -, -)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Please note that for some nodes, a leaf node may not be present as per the given edges. Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:

[9]
