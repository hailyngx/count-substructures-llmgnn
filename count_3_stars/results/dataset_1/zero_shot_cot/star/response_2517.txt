Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Starting with the central nodes of the 3-stars, based on the given edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

<0, (5, 7, -)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (5, -, -)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, -)>
<8, (3, 5, -)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph. []

To find the final answer, we count the number of unique 3-stars found, and since each 3-star has one central node, we need to count the total number of central nodes. Given that each 3-star has exactly 3 leaves, we can use the total number of nodes and the calculated central nodes to determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.
