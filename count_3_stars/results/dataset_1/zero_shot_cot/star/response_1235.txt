Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them potential centers of 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to three other nodes.

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 6)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<6, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 8, 9)>,
<8, (6, 7, 9)>,
<9, (0, 2, 7)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
