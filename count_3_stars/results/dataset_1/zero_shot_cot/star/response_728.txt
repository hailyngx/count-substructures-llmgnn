Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7, forming a 3-star <0, (6, 7)>.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, and 9. We can form two 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 6, 8)> and <1, (3, 6, 9)>.

For the remaining nodes, we don't have a 3-star pattern involving the center node being connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
