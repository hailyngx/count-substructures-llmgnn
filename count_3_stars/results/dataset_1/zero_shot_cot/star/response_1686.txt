Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, let's count the number of 3-stars. 

First, let's list out the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 7
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (5, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 7)> or <3, (1, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (5, 6)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 4)> or <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 6: <6, (4)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found gives us a total of [8] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
