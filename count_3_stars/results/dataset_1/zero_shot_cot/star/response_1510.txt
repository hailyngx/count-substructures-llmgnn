Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 6 has 5 adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
2. Node 3 has 4 adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 9
3. Node 8 has 4 adjacent nodes: 3, 4, 5
4. Node 5 has 3 adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 9
5. Node 7 has 2 adjacent nodes: 2, 4
6. Node 4 has 2 adjacent nodes: 7, 8
7. Node 9 has 2 adjacent nodes: 3, 5
8. Node 1 has 1 adjacent node: 6
9. Node 2 has 1 adjacent node: 6

Now, let's find all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
