Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the center nodes with three neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 6.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 7.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 9.

Step 2: Count the 3-stars
- The 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- The 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- The 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- The 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars
- There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
