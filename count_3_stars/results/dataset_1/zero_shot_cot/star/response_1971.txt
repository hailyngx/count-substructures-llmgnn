Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Given the information provided, we can see that the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Let's list the unique 3-star patterns:

<0, (4, 9, 1)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
