Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The center of the 3-star graph must be a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, x)> (No valid 3-star since node 2 is connected to 2, 4, and 0)
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, x)> (No valid 3-star since node 4 is connected to 2 and 3)
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (x, x, x)> (No valid 3-star since node 7 is not connected to 3 nodes)
<8, (x, x, x)> (No valid 3-star since node 8 is not connected to 3 nodes)
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [6].
