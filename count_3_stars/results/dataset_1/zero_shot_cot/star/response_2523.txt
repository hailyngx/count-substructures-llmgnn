Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes in the graph which have degree 3. 

From the given graph, the nodes and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 1

Therefore, the nodes that can potentially be central nodes of 3-stars are nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7. 

Let's enumerate the 3-stars with their central nodes and leaf nodes:

<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
