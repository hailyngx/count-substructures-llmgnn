Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 9)>
3. <2, (4, 8, -)>
4. <3, (1, 8, -)>
5. <4, (0, 2, -)>
6. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 7, 9)>
8. <7, (5, 6, -)>
9. <8, (2, 3, 6)>
10. <9, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
