Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 8, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
