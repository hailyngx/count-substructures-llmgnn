Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting the number of times a node with exactly three neighbors is connected to three other nodes which do not share any neighbors with each other.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. These nodes do not share any neighbors other than node 1.
2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9. These nodes do not share any neighbors other than node 5.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>.
