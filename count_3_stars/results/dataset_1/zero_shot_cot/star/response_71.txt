Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to find and count the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
   - Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
   - Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - For each node identified, count the number of 3-stars it forms. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
   - In this case, nodes 0, 2, and 5 form 3-stars.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 3)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
