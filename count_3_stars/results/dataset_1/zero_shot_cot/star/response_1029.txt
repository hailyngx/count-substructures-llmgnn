Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and the nodes connected to them. Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, each central node should have exactly three neighbors.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central Node: 0
   Neighbors: 3, 8, 9
   <0, (3, 8, 9)>

2. Central Node: 3
   Neighbors: 0, 2, 5
   <3, (0, 2, 5)>

3. Central Node: 5
   Neighbors: 1, 3, 4
   <5, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
