Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 8.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - We can see that there are 3-stars centered at nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 8. Nodes 4, 6, and 9 are not centers of 3-stars.

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   <0, (1, 4, 7)>
   <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   <3, (2, 6, 7)>
   <7, (0, 3, 5)>
   <8, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
