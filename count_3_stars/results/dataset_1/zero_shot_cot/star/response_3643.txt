Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 13 different 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
