Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. For each node, check if it is connected by edges to exactly three other nodes.
2. If a node satisfies this condition, then it forms a 3-star with the other three nodes it is connected to.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
