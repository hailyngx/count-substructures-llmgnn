Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will act as the center of the 3-stars, and the other nodes connected to them will be the leaves.

In this graph, nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5 satisfy the condition of having three edges connected to them. We will now list the 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes:
 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
