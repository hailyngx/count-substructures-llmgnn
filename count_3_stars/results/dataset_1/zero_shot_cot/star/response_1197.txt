Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., the central nodes of potential 3-stars).

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 3, 4, and 8. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1: {(1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 8), (1, 5, 7)}
- For node 3: {(3, 1, 6), (3, 2, 9)}
- For node 4: {(4, 2, 8), (4, 9, 8)}
- For node 8: {(8, 1, 4), (8, 4, 9), (8, 9, 1)}

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
