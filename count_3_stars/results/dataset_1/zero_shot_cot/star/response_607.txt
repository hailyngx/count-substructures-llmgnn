Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Given the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <4, (6, 9, 0)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
7. <9, (0, 4, 5)>

So, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
