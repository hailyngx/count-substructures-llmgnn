Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 since it will serve as the central node for potential 3-stars. 
The nodes connected to node 0 are 5 and 6. Now we can form 3-stars with 0 as the center and 5 or 6 as one of the leaves. 

Let's look at the nodes connected to other nodes as well.  
Node 2 is connected to node 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
Node 8 is connected to node 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.

Now let's list the unique 3-stars we can form:
<0, (5, 4, 6)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3].
