Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's list down the nodes connected to each node to make it easier to identify the 3-star graphs.

Node 0: 1, 4, 7  
Node 1: 0, 3  
Node 2: 4, 5  
Node 3: 1, 7, 9  
Node 4: 0, 2, 7  
Node 5: 2, 7  
Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 5  
Node 8: 9  
Node 9: 3, 8  

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>  
<1, (0, 3, 7)>  
<2, (4, 5, 7)>  
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
