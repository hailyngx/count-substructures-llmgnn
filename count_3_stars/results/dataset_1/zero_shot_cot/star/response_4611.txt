Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, we will need to go through each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Upon examining all nodes, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 12 3-stars in the given graph.
