Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 6
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[4]

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
