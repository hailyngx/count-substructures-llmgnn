Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
We'll first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (2, 0, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (3, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 0, 4)>

Therefore, we have identified the 3-stars in the graph. The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
