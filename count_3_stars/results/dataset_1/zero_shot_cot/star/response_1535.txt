Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the potential 3-star structures in the given graph. 
To form a 3-star, we need to find a central node connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9. However, this does not form a 3-star structure as node 4 has four connections.
- Node 8 has connections with nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9. Again, this does not form a 3-star structure as node 8 has four connections.
- Node 9 has connections with nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8. Similar to the previous nodes, node 9 has four connections and does not form a 3-star.

There are no 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is: [0]

In the given graph, there are no 3-star structures present.
