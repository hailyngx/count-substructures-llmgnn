Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes that satisfy this condition:

Node 0 has 3 edges
Node 1 has 3 edges
Node 4 has 4 edges
Node 6 has 4 edges
Node 7 has 3 edges
Node 8 has 3 edges
Node 9 has 4 edges

So, the central nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 7, 8.

Next, we will look for the leaves connected to each central node. This will help us determine the 3-stars in the graph.

For node 0:
Leaves connected to 0: 1, 5, 7

For node 1:
Leaves connected to 1: 0, 5, 9

For node 7:
Leaves connected to 7: 0, 4, 9

For node 8:
Leaves connected to 8: 3, 4, 6

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
