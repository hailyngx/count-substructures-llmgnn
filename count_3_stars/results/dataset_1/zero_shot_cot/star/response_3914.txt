Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Initially, let's identify the nodes that are connected to at least three other nodes, which could potentially form 3-stars. 

Nodes connected to three or more other nodes:
- Node 0 (connected to 5 other nodes)
- Node 1 (connected to 5 other nodes)
- Node 4 (connected to 5 other nodes)
- Node 7 (connected to 4 other nodes)
- Node 9 (connected to 5 other nodes)

Now, let's go through the identified nodes and determine the 3-stars that can be formed around each of them.

- 3-stars centered around Node 0: 
    <0, (1, 2, 4)>
    <0, (1, 4, 7)>
    <0, (1, 4, 8)>
    <0, (2, 4, 7)>
    <0, (4, 7, 8)>

- 3-stars centered around Node 1:
    <1, (0, 4, 7)>
    <1, (0, 4, 9)>
    <1, (3, 4, 7)>
    <1, (4, 7, 9)>
    <1, (4, 8, 9)>

- 3-stars centered around Node 4:
    <4, (0, 1, 7)>
    <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    <4, (0, 2, 7)>
    <4, (1, 7, 9)>
    <4, (1, 8, 9)>

- 3-stars centered around Node 7:
    <7, (0, 1, 4)>
    <7, (0, 4, 5)>
    <7, (1, 4, 9)>
    
- 3-stars centered around Node 9:
    <9, (1, 4, 7)>
    <9, (1, 4, 8)>
    <9, (3, 4, 8)>
    <9, (4, 6, 8)>
    <9, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of five unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
