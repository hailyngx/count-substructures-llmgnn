Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as those could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 
Based on the given edges, the nodes with three connections are: 
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 4 (connected to 0, 5, 7, 9)
- Node 5 (connected to 0, 1, 4, 6)

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking at each potential center node and its connections:
1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <0, (4, 5, 9)>
   - Total: 3

2. For node 4:
   - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
   - Total: 2

3. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 4)>
   - Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>.
