Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows: 

<0, (1, 7, 0)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 1)>
<0, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (1, 9, 4)>
<5, (1, 9, 5)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [11].
