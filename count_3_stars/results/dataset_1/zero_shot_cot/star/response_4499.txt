Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
- To form a 3-star, we need a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
- The 3-stars in this graph are:
[4]

Hence, the final answer is [1].  
The unique 3-star found is <4, (2, 3, 5)>.
