Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

The central node of a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections to find all 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to Node 4, but there are not enough edges to form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, and 9, forming a 3-star <1, (4, 6, 9)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to Node 9, but there are not enough edges to form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to Nodes 5, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to Nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6, forming three different 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, and <4, (5, 6, 0)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, and 7, forming a 3-star <5, (3, 4, 7)>.
7. Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8, forming two different 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 8)> and <6, (3, 4, 8)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to Node 5, but there are not enough edges to form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 is connected to Nodes 3 and 6, but there are not enough edges to form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1 and 2, but there are not enough edges to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 0)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, and <6, (3, 4, 8)>.

Finally, counting all the identified 3-stars, we get a total of [8] 3-stars.
