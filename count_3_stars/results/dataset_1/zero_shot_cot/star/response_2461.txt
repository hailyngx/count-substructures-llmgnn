Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's start by finding all nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 3, 7)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 5, 6)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 5, 8)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 2, 5, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 4, 5, 6)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars gives us the answer:
