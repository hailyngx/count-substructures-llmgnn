Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Find the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
- Nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9 have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Step 2: Check if these nodes with 3 edges form 3-stars.
- Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 5, 6) are 3-stars.
- Node 3: (3, 2, 8), (3, 9, 6) are 3-stars.
- Node 6: (6, 5, 0), (6, 9, 3) are 3-stars.
- Node 9: (9, 2, 3), (9, 6, 5) are 3-stars.

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
- Total number of unique 3-stars: 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 9, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 4)>, <3, (9, 6, 5)>, <6, (5, 0, 9)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>.
