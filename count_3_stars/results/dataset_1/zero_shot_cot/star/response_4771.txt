Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges.

First, let's list out the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7 are potential centers of 3-stars. Let's identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
