Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three edges connected to them, as these nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star graph. 
From the given edges, we see that the nodes with three edges connected to them are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 9.

Next, we need to check for each of these nodes if they form a 3-star graph with the connected nodes. 
Let's analyze each potential 3-star graph:

- For node 0: Since it is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9, it forms two 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)> and <0, (1, 7, 9)>.
- For node 1: Since it is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7, it forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 7)>.
- For node 3: Since it is connected to nodes 1 and 2, it does not form a 3-star.
- For node 5: Since it is connected to nodes 0 and 9, it does not form a 3-star.
- For node 9: Since it is connected to nodes 0 and 5, it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2, and they are <0, (1, 4, 5)> and <0, (1, 7, 9)>.

So, the final answer is [2].
