Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (6, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (3, 7, 5)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 9)>
4. <4, (6, 9, 5)>
5. <5, (3, 6, 7)>
6. <7, (2, 5, 8)>
7. <8, (0, 5, 7)>
8. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

So, there are a total of [8] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
