Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

In this graph, the central node can be any node with exactly 3 neighboring nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 5)>
3. <2, (4, 3, 9)>
4. <3, (4, 2, 9)>
5. <4, (2, 3, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (5, 7, -)>
8. <7, (4, 5, 6)>
9. <8, (1, -, -)>
10. <9, (4, 3, -)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
