Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. However, it forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7:
   <3, (4, 5, 7)>

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9:
   <4, (1, 3, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.]
