Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
