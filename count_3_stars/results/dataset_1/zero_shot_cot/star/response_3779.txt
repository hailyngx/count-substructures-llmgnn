Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

By examining the given edges, we find the following central nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph using the identified central nodes:
- For Node 1:
    - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 8)>
    - Total: 4 stars
- For Node 4:
    - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <4, (1, 5, 8)>
    - Total: 2 stars
- For Node 5:
    - <5, (1, 4, 7)>
    - Total: 1 star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, and <5, (1, 4, 7)>.
