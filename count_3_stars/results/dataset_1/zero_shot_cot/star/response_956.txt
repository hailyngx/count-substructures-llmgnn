Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to the central node:  
Nodes connected to node 0: 4  
Nodes connected to node 1: 7, 9  
Nodes connected to node 2: 4  
Nodes connected to node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8  
Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8  
Nodes connected to node 5: 3  
Nodes connected to node 6: 3, 9  
Nodes connected to node 7: 1, 4  
Nodes connected to node 8: 3, 4  
Nodes connected to node 9: 1, 6  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph:  
From the list above, we can identify the following 3-stars:  
<0, (4, 2, 3)>  
<1, (7, 9, 4)>  
<3, (4, 5, 6)>  
<3, (4, 6, 8)>  

Step 3: Output the final answer:  
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
Unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (4, 2, 3)>  
<1, (7, 9, 4)>  
<3, (4, 5, 6)>  
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
