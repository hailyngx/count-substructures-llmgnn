Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-star graphs.

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9

Step 2: For each center node identified, check their adjacent nodes to form 3-star graphs.

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>

For Node 1:
- <1, (0, 5, 9)>

For Node 2:
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>

For Node 3:
- No 3-star as it has only 2 adjacent nodes.

For Node 5:
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>

For Node 6:
- No 3-star as it has only 2 adjacent nodes.

For Node 8:
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>

For Node 9:
- <9, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Total number of 3-stars: 10
