Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that follow the definition of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three leaves, we will examine each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star with three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (5)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
