Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. 

Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 9).
Node 1 has 2 edges connected to it: (1, 2), (1, 9).
Node 2 has 2 edges connected to it: (2, 0), (2, 1).
Node 3 has 2 edges connected to it: (3, 0), (3, 4).
Node 6 has 2 edges connected to it: (6, 8), (6, 9).
Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it: (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6).
Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 6), (9, 7).

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (2, 3, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
- Node 9 forms 2 3-stars: <9, (0, 1, 6)> and <9, (6, 7, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] (1 + 1 + 2).
