Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Given the edges provided, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4) - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4) - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 9) - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star (since it has only 2 edges)
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6) - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star (since it has only 2 edges)
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 4) - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2) - <7, (0, 1, 2)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star (since it has only 2 edges)
10. Node 9: No 3-star (since it has only 1 edge)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
