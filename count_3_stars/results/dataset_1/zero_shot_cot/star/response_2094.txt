Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (1, 7, 0)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
