Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 5, -)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
