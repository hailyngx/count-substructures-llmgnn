Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes with exactly three neighbors and check for each potential 3-star. 

Let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 7
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 2
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, we found 6 unique 3-stars. The final answer is [6].
