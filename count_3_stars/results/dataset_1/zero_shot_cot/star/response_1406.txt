Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
    - Node 0 has 3 edges connected to it: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8)
    - Node 6 has 5 edges connected to it: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 9)
    - Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6)
    - Node 9 has 2 edges connected to it: (9, 6), (9, 7)

Step 2: Identify the 3-star configurations.
    - 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 6, 8)>
    - 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>
    - 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 1, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
    - Total number of 3-stars: [4]

Output: 
[4]
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>
