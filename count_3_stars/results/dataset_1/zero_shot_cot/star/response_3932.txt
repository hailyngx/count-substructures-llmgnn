Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star graph in the given graph. 
A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can see that the central node is node 0 since node 0 is connected to 5 other nodes. 
The possible 3-stars connected to node 0 are: 
1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
3. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
4. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
  
Next, let's count the number of occurrences of these 3-stars in the given graph: 
- <0, (4, 5, 6)> appears once
- <0, (4, 5, 7)> appears once
- <0, (4, 6, 7)> appears once
- <0, (5, 6, 7)> does not appear

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
