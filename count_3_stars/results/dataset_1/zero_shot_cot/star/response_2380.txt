Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with exactly 3 edges are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8

Next, for each of these nodes, let's identify the connected nodes to form 3-stars:

- For node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 8), (0, 1, 8)
- For node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 3)
- For node 3: (3, 1, 6), (3, 6, 7), (3, 6, 9)
- For node 6: (6, 2, 3), (6, 3, 9), (6, 2, 9)
- For node 8: (8, 0, 7)

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 3)>, <3, (6, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 8)>.
