Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 3, 7), (1, 8, 9)
2. Node 1: (0, 2, 5)
3. Node 2: (1, 4, 5)
4. Node 4: (2, 9, 8)
5. Node 5: (1, 6, 7), (1, 8, 0), (2, 7, 8), (2, 6, 4)
6. Node 8: (0, 9, 5), (0, 7, 5), (5, 9, 4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 9, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 4)>
<8, (0, 9, 5)>
<8, (0, 7, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
