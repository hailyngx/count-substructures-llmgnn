Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (4, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
3. <2, (4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
