Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected nodes to form the 3-stars.

1. Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 6)
4. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9)
5. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5)
6. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 8)
7. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7)
8. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5)

Next, we count the number of unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, _)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, _)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Combining all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
