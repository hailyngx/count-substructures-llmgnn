Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the central nodes are:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.

By examining the connections, we can find the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph, we get a total of 5 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
