Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars:

- Node 0 connects to nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 connects to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 2 connects to node 3.
- Node 3 connects to nodes 0, 2, 6.
- Node 4 connects to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 5 connects to nodes 0, 8, 9.
- Node 6 connects to nodes 0, 3, 7.
- Node 7 connects to nodes 0, 6.
- Node 8 connects to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5.
- Node 9 connects to nodes 1, 4, 5.

From these connections, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 6)> 
<0, (3, 5, 8)> 
<0, (3, 6, 7)> 
<0, (5, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
