Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that could potentially be the center of a 3-star.
These nodes have exactly three incident edges since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three leaves:
- Node 0 has 5 incident edges
- Node 2 has 3 incident edges
- Node 3 has 2 incident edges
- Node 4 has 2 incident edges
- Node 7 has 4 incident edges
- Node 8 has 2 incident edges
- Node 9 has 5 incident edges

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0, we have 5 choose 3 = 10 possible 3-stars, as there are 5 possible pairs of leaves. 
  This results in 10 * 3! = 60 distinct 3-stars since the order of the leaves matters.
- For Node 7, we have 4 choose 3 = 4 possible 3-stars.
  This results in 4 * 3! = 12 distinct 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 4, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 9, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 9, 4)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<7, (4, 9, 0)>
