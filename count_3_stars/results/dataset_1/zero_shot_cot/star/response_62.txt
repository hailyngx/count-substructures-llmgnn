Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. Recall that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The graph based on the provided edges is as follows:
```
0 -- 3
|    |
4 -- 5 -- 7
|    |    |
6 -- 1 -- 8 -- 9
```

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<5, (7, 8, 1)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
