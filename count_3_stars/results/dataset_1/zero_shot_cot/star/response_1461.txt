Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- There is a 3-star with node 0 as the central node and nodes 2, 4, and 8 as the leaves: <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- There is another 3-star with node 0 as the central node and nodes 4, 8, and 9 as the leaves: <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- There is a 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 0, 7, and 1 as the leaves: <2, (0, 7, 1)>
- There is a 3-star with node 4 as the central node and nodes 0, 1, and 3 as the leaves: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- There is a 3-star with node 7 as the central node and nodes 2, 5, and 6 as the leaves: <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- Finally, there is a 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 0, 9, and 1 as the leaves: <8, (0, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
