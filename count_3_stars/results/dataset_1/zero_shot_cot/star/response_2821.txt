Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (6, 7, 1)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, )>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [5].
