Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's list out the 3-star configurations in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (3, 7)>

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
