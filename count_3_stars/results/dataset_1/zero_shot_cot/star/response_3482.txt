Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 1)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, -)>
<9, (5, -, -)>

Thus, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
