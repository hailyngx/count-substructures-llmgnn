Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars:

The nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
The 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (8, 9, -)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 6, -)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 8, -)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
