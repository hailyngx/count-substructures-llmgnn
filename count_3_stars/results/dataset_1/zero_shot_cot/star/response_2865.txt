Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 6, 8
2. Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 6, 7
3. Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9
4. Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
5. Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 5
6. Node 5 has neighbors: 4, 8, 9
7. Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
8. Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 3, 6
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5
10. Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 3, 5

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- From node 0: <0, (2, 6, 8)>
- From node 1: <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>
- From node 3: <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- From node 4: None
- From node 5: None
- From node 6: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- From node 7: None
- From node 8: None
- From node 9: None

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>
