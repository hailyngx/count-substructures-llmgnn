Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8.

Now let's find all the 3-stars in this graph. A 3-star consists of a central node and 3 other nodes connected to it.

1. For node 0:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 0 as the center since it is only connected to nodes 1 and 4.

2. For node 1:
    - <1, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 9)>

3. For node 2:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 2 as the center since it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

4. For node 3:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 3 as the center since it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

5. For node 4:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 4 as the center since it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

6. For node 5:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 5 as the center since it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

7. For node 6:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 6 as the center since it is connected to less than 3 nodes.

8. For node 7:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 7 as the center since it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

9. For node 8:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 8 as the center since it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

10. For node 9:
    - There are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center since it is connected to more than 3 nodes.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>.
