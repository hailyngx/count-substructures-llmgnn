Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 
The central nodes are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
1. Central node 0: No 3-stars as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
2. Central node 1: One 3-star <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. Central node 4: Two 3-stars <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>
4. Central node 6: Two 3-stars <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
5. Central node 7: Two 3-stars <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
6. Central node 8: No 3-stars as it is connected to only 1 other node.
7. Central node 9: One 3-star <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>.
