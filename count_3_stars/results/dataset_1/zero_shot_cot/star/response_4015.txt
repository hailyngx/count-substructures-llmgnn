Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the nodes that form 3-stars based on the definition provided.

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the possible 3-stars based on the given edges:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, _)>
<8, (5, 9, _)> 

Here the last two 3-stars have incomplete details due to the absence of 9 in the given edges.

Since we are only considering complete 3-stars, we have 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (1, 4, 6)> and <2, (3, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
