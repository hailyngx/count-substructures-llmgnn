Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
    
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
