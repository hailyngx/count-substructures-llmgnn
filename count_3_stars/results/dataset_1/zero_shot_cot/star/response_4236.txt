Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node of each 3-star in the graph:
- Node 0 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 2 has 1 edge connected.
- Node 3 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 5 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 6 has 6 edges connected.
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 8 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 9 has 1 edge connected.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: (1, 5, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 6, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 6, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 1, 4)
- Node 7: (7, 4, 5)
- Node 8: (8, 4, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 6, 7)

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (5, 7, 1)>
<4, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
