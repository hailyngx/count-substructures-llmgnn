Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each other:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
Node 8 is connected to node 4.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. From node 0: (0, 3, 7), (0, 6, 2), (0, 7, 5) => <0, (3, 6, 7)> 
2. From node 2: (2, 6, 0), (2, 9, 3) => <2, (6, 0, 9)> 
3. From node 3: (3, 0, 7), (3, 7, 5), (3, 9, 2), (3, 9, 7) => <3, (0, 7, 9)>
4. From node 4: None
5. From node 5: None
6. From node 6: None
7. From node 7: (7, 0, 3), (7, 3, 9), (7, 5, 0), (7, 9, 3) => <7, (0, 3, 9)>
8. From node 8: None
9. From node 9: None

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 0, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, and <7, (0, 3, 9)>.
