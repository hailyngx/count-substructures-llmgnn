Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Let's start with the central nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 3), (0, 4), and (0, 9).
2. Node 3 has 5 edges: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 9), and (0, 3).
3. Node 4 has 1 edge: (0, 4).
4. Node 5 has 1 edge: (3, 5).
5. Node 6 has 1 edge: (6, 7).
6. Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 6), (7, 9), and (9, 7).
7. Node 9 has 5 edges: (0, 9), (3, 9), (7, 9), (9, 0), and (9, 7).

Now, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 3, 9)>
<7, (6, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 0, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
