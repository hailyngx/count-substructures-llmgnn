Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 3 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7. <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
2. Node 1 is the central node connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. <1, (3, 7, 9)>.
3. Node 2 is the central node connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8. <2, (3, 7, 8)>.
4. Node 5 is the central node connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9. <5, (0, 3, 9)>.
5. Node 7 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6. <7, (1, 2, 6)>.
6. Node 6 is the central node connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. <6, (3, 7, 9)>.
7. Node 9 is the central node connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. <9, (1, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
