Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 9)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 9, 5)>
5. Node 4: <4, (2, 7, 5)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 4)>
7. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
8. Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
9. Node 8: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
10. Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
