Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (6, 8), (1, 6)>  
<1, (4, 6), (0, 4)>  
<2, (5, 7), (3, 5)>  
<3, (5, 7), (2, 9)>  
<4, (1, 5), (8, 6)>  
<5, (2, 3), (4, 7)>  
<6, (0, 1), (5, 8)>  
<7, (2, 9), (3, 5)>  
<8, (4, 6), (5, 9)>  
<9, (3, 7), (5, 8)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
