Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
