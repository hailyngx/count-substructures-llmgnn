Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 9)>
3. <1, (2, 6, 7)>
4. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
6. <3, (0, 4, 7)>
7. <5, (2, 6, 7)>
8. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
9. <6, (1, 3, 8)>
10. <7, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
