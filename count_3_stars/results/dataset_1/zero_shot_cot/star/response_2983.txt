Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.  
From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are:  
Node 1 (edges: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9))  
Node 3 (edges: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9))  
Node 5 (edges: (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8))  
Node 6 (edges: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 9))  

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their connected nodes.  
Starting with Node 1:  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.  
Among these connected nodes, only nodes 3 and 6 are connected to each other.  
So, the 3-star with Node 1 as the center is <1, (3, 6, 9)>.  

Moving on to Node 3:  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  
Among these connected nodes, only nodes 1, 6, and 9 are connected to each other.  
So, the 3-stars with Node 3 as the center are <3, (1, 6, 9)>.  

Now for Node 5:  
Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.  
Among these connected nodes, only node 3 and 6 are connected to each other.  
So, the 3-star with Node 5 as the center is <5, (3, 6, 8)>.  

Finally, for Node 6:  
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9.  
Among these connected nodes, only nodes 1 and 3 are connected to each other.  
So, the 3-star with Node 6 as the center is <6, (1, 3, 9)>.  

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.  
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>.  
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
