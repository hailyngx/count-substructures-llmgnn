Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in this graph by identifying the central node and the three leaves associated with each 3-star.

<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
