Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify 3-stars by finding nodes with 3 adjacent edges.

By examining the provided edges, we can find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (4, 8, 2)>
2. <1, (2, 6, 0)>
3. <2, (8, 4, 1)>
4. <3, (4, 5, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <5, (3, 6, -)>
7. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (6, 8, -)>
9. <8, (2, 0, 3)>
10. <9, (4, 6, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
