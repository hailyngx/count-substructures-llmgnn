Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: <0, (3, 8, 9)>
2. Node 2: <2, (3, 6, 9)>
3. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
4. Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
5. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 2)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
