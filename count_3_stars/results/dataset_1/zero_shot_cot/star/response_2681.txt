Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph. 

We need to find nodes with exactly three neighbors, which means identifying central nodes that are connected to exactly three leaves.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
