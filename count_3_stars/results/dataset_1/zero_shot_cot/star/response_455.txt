Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. Let's go step by step:

1. Begin by identifying the nodes that are connected to each other:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.

2. Now, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided:
   - A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
   The 3-stars in the given graph are:
   <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   <0, (4, 5, 6)>
   <2, (0, 4, 9)>
   <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   <9, (2, 3, 8)>
   
3. Therefore, counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get:
   - Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Thus, the final answer inside brackets is [5].
