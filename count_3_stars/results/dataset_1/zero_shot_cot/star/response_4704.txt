Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 9, x)> (Note: x is unknown as its connection is not provided)
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>

Thus, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
