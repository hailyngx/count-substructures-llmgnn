Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 4), (1, 6, 2)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 1, 4), (2, 7, 4)
4. Node 6: (6, 0, 3), (6, 1, 3), (6, 3, 9)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
