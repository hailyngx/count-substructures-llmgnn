Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 have degrees equal to 3, which means they can potentially be central nodes of 3-star graphs. 

Let's analyze each potential central node:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9. <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 7. <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 3: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6 itself. <6, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
