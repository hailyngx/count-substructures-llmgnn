Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to node 0.  
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.

Step 2: Check for 3-stars with the center at node 0.  
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <0, (4, 9, 1)>
- <0, (4, 9, 6)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
