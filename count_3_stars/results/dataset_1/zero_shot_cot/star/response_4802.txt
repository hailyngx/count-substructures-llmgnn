Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three connected nodes, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
