Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

The central node of the 3-stars must have exactly three edges connected to it. Let's identify these central nodes:

- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9) total 3 edges
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8) total 3 edges
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 7) total 3 edges
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3) total 3 edges

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Hence, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].
