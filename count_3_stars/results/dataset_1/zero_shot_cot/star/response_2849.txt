Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 4. These will be the leaves of the 3-stars where node 4 is the center. 
Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars centered at node 4.
1. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
2. <4, (0, 7, 9)>

Next, let's check if there are any other 3-stars in the graph.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
