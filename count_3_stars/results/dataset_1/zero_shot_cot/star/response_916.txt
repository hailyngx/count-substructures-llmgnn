Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all nodes with exactly three incident edges. These nodes will be the center nodes of the 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
   Therefore, <0, (2, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
   There are no 3-stars with node 1 as the central node since it only has 2 incident edges.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
   There are no 3-stars with node 2 as the central node since it only has 2 incident edges.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
   Therefore, <3, (0, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
   There are no 3-stars with node 4 as the central node since it only has 2 incident edges.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
   There are no 3-stars with node 5 as the central node since it only has 2 incident edges.

7. Node 6 is connected to node 1.
   There are no 3-stars with node 6 as the central node since it only has 1 incident edge.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
   There are no 3-stars with node 7 as the central node since it only has 2 incident edges.

9. Node 8 is connected to node 3.
   There are no 3-stars with node 8 as the central node since it only has 1 incident edge.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
   Therefore, <9, (1, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>.
