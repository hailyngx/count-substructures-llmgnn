Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which will be the centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes that satisfy this condition are: 0, 2, 4, 6.

Next, let's find all 3-stars with the identified center nodes. 

1. For node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   <0, (3, 4, 2)>

2. For node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
   <2, (3, 4, 8)>

3. For node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
   <4, (0, 2, 7)>
   <4, (0, 2, 8)>

4. For node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
   <6, (3, 5, 7)>
   <6, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
