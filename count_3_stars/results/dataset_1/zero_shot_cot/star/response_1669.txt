Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node by exactly two edges. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars. 
For each central node, the nodes connected to it by exactly two edges will be the leaves. Then we find the possible 3-stars in the graph. 

For central node 0:
Leaves: 1, 4, 5, 8
Possible 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>

For central node 1:
Leaves: 0, 9
Possible 3-star:
<1, (0, 9, *)> (No other node connected to 1 by exactly two edges)

For central node 2:
Leaves: 5, 9
Possible 3-star:
<2, (5, 9, *)> (No other node connected to 2 by exactly two edges)

For central node 3:
Leaves: 5
Possible 3-star:
<3, (5, *, *)> (No other node connected to 3 by exactly two edges)

For central node 4:
Leaves: 0, 5, 9
Possible 3-stars:
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 0, 9)>

For central node 5:
Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
Possible 3-stars:
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (4, 0, 6)>
<5, (4, 3, 6)>

For central node 6:
Leaves: 5
Possible 3-star:
<6, (5, *, *)> (No other node connected to 6 by exactly two edges)

For central node 8:
Leaves: 0, 9
Possible 3-star:
<8, (0, 9, *)> (No other node connected to 8 by exactly two edges)

For central node 9:
Leaves: 1, 2, 4, 8
Possible 3-stars:
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].    
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 9, *)>, <2, (5, 9, *)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 0, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (4, 0, 6)>, <5, (4, 3, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>.
