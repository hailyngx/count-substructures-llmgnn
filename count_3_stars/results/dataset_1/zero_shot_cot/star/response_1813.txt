Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with the number of their connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 1+1+1+1 = 4 connections
- Node 1: 1+2+1 = 4 connections
- Node 2: 1+2+1 = 4 connections
- Node 3: 1+1+1 = 3 connections
- Node 4: 1+1 = 2 connections
- Node 5: 1+3+1 = 5 connections
- Node 6: 1+2+1 = 4 connections
- Node 7: 1+1 = 2 connections
- Node 8: 1+1 = 2 connections
- Node 9: 1+3 = 2 connections

From the connections above, we see that there are <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)> and <5, (0, 1, 2)>.

Count of 3-stars: [3]
