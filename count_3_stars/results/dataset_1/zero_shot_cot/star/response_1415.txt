Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 4, 8), (0, 4, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 6, 3)
3. Node 3: (3, 5, 7), (3, 6, 8)
4. Node 4: (4, 0, 6), (4, 6, 7)
5. Node 5: (5, 2, 6), (5, 3, 7)
6. Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 4, 5), (6, 3, 8), (6, 7, 8), (6, 8, 9)
7. Node 8: (8, 0, 3), (8, 6, 9)
8. Node 9: (9, 0, 6), (9, 6, 8)

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [12]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 3, 5)>, <3, (5, 7, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 6, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 8, 6)>, <6, (8, 9, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (6, 9, 8)>
