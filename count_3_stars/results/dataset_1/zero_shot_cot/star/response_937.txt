Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (7, 9, -)>
<9, (8, - , -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
