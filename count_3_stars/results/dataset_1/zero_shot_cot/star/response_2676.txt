Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the given edges to find all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

Now, let's calculate the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
