Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

From the given edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
