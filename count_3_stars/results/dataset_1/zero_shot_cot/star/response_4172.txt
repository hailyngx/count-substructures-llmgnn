Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
3. <3, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (5, 8, 9)>
5. <5, (1, 4, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 3, 8)>
7. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
8. <8, (4, 6, -)>
9. <9, (1, 4, 5)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [9].
