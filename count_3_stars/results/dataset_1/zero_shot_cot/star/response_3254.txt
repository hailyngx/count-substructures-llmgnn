Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 3)>
2. 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 7)>
3. 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
4. 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
