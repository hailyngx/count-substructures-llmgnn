Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the unique set of nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 

After examining the edges provided, we can count the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <0, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (0, 9, 3)>
    - <3, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <6, (0, 8, 9)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <9, (0, 2, 6)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
