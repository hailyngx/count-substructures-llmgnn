Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 4: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
3. Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
4. Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
5. Node 8: <8, (4, 6, 7)>
6. Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 7)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
