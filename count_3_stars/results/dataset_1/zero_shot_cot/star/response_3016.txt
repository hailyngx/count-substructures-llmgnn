Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations of nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we can count the number of 3-stars by finding all the valid combinations. Let's go step-by-step:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it has exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes can potentially be central nodes of 3-stars.

2. For each node with 3 neighbors, check if the neighbors form a valid 3-star configuration.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9. So, it can potentially be a central node in a 3-star. Let's check its neighbors:
    <4, (3, 5, 7)>
    <4, (3, 5, 8)>
    <4, (3, 5, 9)>
    
2. Node 5 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. So, it can potentially be a central node in a 3-star. Let's check its neighbors:
    <5, (1, 3, 6)>
    <5, (1, 4, 6)>
    <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    <5, (2, 4, 6)>
    
3. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9. Since it doesn't have exactly 3 neighbors, it cannot be a central node in a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
