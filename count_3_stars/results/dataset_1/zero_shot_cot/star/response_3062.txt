Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their adjacent nodes:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 5

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (1, 5, 9) --> <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 4: (5, 6, 8) --> <4, (5, 6, 8)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
