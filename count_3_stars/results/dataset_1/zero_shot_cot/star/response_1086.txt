Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by finding all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Before proceeding, we can note that based on the given information, there are no self-loops and parallel edges in the graph.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 6, 0)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<5, (7, 6, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [9].
