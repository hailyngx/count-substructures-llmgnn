Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's start by identifying the possible 3-stars based on the definition provided.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, and 9. So, <0, (2, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 8, which are not connected. Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
3. Node 2 has only 1 neighbor, which is node 0. So, there are no 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 8. So, <3, (1, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has only 1 neighbor, which is node 8. So, there are no 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
6. Node 5 has only 1 neighbor, which is node 3. So, there are no 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
7. Node 7 has only 1 neighbor, which is node 9. So, there are no 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, and 4. So, <8, (0, 1, 3)> and <8, (0, 3, 4)> are 3-stars.
9. Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 7, which are not connected. Therefore, there are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Count of 3-stars: [3].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
