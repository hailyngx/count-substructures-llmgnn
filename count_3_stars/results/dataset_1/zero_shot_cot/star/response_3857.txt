Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them since those nodes can be the centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0 (connected to 4, 5, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to 4, 5, 6)

Now, let's find all possible 3-stars with the identified nodes as centers and count them. 

1. From node 0:
   - <0, (4, 5, 8)>
  
2. From node 2:
   - <2, (4, 5, 6)>

Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars:
