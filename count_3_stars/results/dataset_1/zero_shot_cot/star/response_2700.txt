Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9. (<0, (6, 7, 9)>)
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7 and 8. (<1, (7, 8)>)
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with node 3. (<2, (3)>)
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5 and 8. (<4, (5, 8)>)
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with node 9. (<6, (9)>)
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with node 1. (<7, (1)>)
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with node 4. (<8, (4)>)
8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0 and 6. (<9, (0, 6)>)

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
