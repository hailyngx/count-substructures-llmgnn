Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Central nodes are nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Based on the given edges, the central nodes are nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6. 

Now, let's find the leaves for each central node:
- Central node 0: Leaves are nodes 5, 6, and 9
- Central node 4: Leaves are nodes 5, 6, and 8
- Central node 5: Leaves are nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Central node 6: Leaves are nodes 0, 1, and 3

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph: 

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
