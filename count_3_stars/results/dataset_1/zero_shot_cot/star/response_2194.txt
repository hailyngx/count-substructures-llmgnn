Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

- Central node 0: Leaves connected to 0 are 2, 8, 9. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 0 are <0, (2, 8, 9)>.
- Central node 1: Leaves connected to 1 are 2, 8. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 1 are <1, (2, 8)>.
- Central node 2: Leaves connected to 2 are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 2 are <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Central node 3: Leaves connected to 3 are 7, 8, 9. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 3 are <3, (7, 8, 9)>.
- Central node 4: Leaves connected to 4 are 2. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 4 is <4, (2)>.
- Central node 5: Leaves connected to 5 are 2. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 5 is <5, (2)>.
- Central node 6: Leaves connected to 6 are 2, 7, 9. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 6 are <6, (2, 7, 9)>.
- Central node 7: Leaves connected to 7 are 3, 6, 8. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 7 are <7, (3, 6, 8)>.
- Central node 8: Leaves connected to 8 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 7. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 8 are <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
- Central node 9: Leaves connected to 9 are 0, 3, 6. Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 9 are <9, (0, 3, 6)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2)>, <5, (2)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>
