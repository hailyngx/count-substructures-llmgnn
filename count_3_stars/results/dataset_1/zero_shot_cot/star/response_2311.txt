Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <4, (1, 8, -)>
5. <8, (1, 4, -)>
