Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
