Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
