Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node and its three connected nodes. 

Given the edges provided, the 3-stars in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 5, 7)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 9 unique 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
