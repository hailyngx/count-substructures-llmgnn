Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the subgraphs where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can find the 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify them:

1. 3-star with central node 0: <0, (3, 4, 8)>
2. 3-star with central node 1: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
3. 3-star with central node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)>
4. 3-star with central node 7: <7, (3, 5, 6)>
5. 3-star with central node 8: <8, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
