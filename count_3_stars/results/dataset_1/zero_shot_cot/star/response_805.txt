Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
3. <7, (1, 4, 5)>
4. <9, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <9, (6, 8, 1)>

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
