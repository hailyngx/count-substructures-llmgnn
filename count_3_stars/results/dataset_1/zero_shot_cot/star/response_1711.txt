Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. 3-star with node 0 as the central node and nodes 2, 3, 5 as the leaves
2. 3-star with node 1 as the central node and nodes 3, 5, 6 as the leaves
3. 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 0, 5, 6 as the leaves
4. 3-star with node 3 as the central node and nodes 0, 1, 7 as the leaves
5. 3-star with node 5 as the central node and nodes 0, 1, 2 as the leaves
6. 3-star with node 6 as the central node and nodes 1, 2, 8 as the leaves
7. 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 4, 6, 9 as the leaves

Therefore, there are a total of 7 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
