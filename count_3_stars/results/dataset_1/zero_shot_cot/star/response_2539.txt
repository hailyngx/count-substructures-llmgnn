Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's examine each node to see if it fits the definition of a central node in a 3-star configuration.

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3 and 8.

From the connections above, we can identify the following 3-stars:

- <0, (3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

In summary: 
[4]
