Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Given edges:
(0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Now we will find all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (6, 1, 8)>
2. <1, (6, 7, 2)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 9)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 4)>
5. <4, (2, 5, 8)>
6. <5, (3, 4, 2)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 8)>
8. <7, (1, 8, 9)>
9. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
10. <9, (2, 7, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
