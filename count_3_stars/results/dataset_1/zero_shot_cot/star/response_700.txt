Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, which is a characteristic of the center node in a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes with three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has edges (0, 4), (0, 5), and (0, 7).
- Node 4 has edges (4, 0), (4, 3), and (4, 6).
- Node 5 has edges (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 9).
- Node 7 has edges (7, 0), (7, 4), and (7, -).

2. Identify the 3-stars based on the central node and its leaves:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, -)>.
