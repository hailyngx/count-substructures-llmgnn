Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars.
2. For each of these central nodes, check if they have three other nodes connected to them forming a 3-star shape.
3. Identify and list the unique 3-stars found.
4. Finally, count the total number of 3-stars.

Let's start with step 1: Identify central nodes. The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5

Now, let's move on to step 2: Identify and list the unique 3-stars. 
The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, let's move to step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
