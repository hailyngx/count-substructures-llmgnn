Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph by checking which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The possible central nodes are: 
- Node 0: connected to 1, 7, and 8
- Node 1: connected to 0, 3, and 4
- Node 2: connected to 4, 5, and 6
- Node 3: connected to 1, 6, and does not have a third connection
- Node 4: connected to 1, 2, and does not have a third connection
- Node 5: connected to 2, 6, and does not have a third connection
- Node 6: connected to 2, 3, 5, and 8
- Node 7: connected to 0 and does not have two other connections
- Node 8: connected to 0, 6, and does not have a third connection

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
