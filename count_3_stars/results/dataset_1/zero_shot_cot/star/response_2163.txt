Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can check each node in the graph to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-star patterns.

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
