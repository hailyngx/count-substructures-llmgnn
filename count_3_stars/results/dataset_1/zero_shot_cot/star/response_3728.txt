Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations of a central node with exactly three leaves connected to it. Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to three other nodes.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9, so it fits the criteria.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7, so it fits the criteria.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9, so it fits the criteria.
   
2. For each of the identified nodes, find all unique combinations of three leaves connected to them.
   - For node 4: (0, 2, 3), (0, 3, 5), (0, 5, 6), (0, 6, 9), (2, 3, 5), (2, 5, 6), (2, 6, 9), (3, 5, 6), (3, 6, 9), (5, 6, 9) 
   - For node 5: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 7), (3, 4, 7)
   - For node 6: (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 8), (1, 8, 9), (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 9), (4, 8, 9)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
   
Categorizing the 3-stars:

- For node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- For node 5: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- For node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
<4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>.
