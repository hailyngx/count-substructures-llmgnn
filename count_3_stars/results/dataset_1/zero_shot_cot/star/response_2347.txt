Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <1, (6, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
