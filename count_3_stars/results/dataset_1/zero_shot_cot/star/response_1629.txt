Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars step by step:
1. Central node 0: 
    - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. Central node 1:
    - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
3. Central node 2:
    - No 3-star as node 2 has only 2 connections.
4. Central node 3:
    - No 3-star as node 3 has only 1 connection.
5. Central node 4:
    - <4, (0, 7, 9)>
6. Central node 5:
    - No 3-star as node 5 has only 1 connection.
7. Central node 6:
    - <6, (0, 1, 5)>
8. Central node 7:
    - <7, (2, 4, 8)> and <7, (8, 9, 4)>
9. Central node 8:
    - <8, (1, 2, 3)> and <8, (7, 9, 1)>
10. Central node 9:
    - No 3-star as node 9 has only 2 connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (8, 9, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (7, 9, 1)>.
