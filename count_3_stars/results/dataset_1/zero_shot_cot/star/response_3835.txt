Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 4, 9
- Node 2: 3, 8
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs:
- Node 0: No 3-star because it has only one neighbor.
- Node 1: No 3-star because it has two neighbors.
- Node 2: No 3-star because it has two neighbors.
- Node 3: No 3-star because it has two neighbors.
- Node 4: No 3-star because it has only one neighbor.
- Node 5: <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: No 3-star because it has two neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star because it has two neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star because it has three neighbors.
- Node 9: No 3-star because it has three neighbors.

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
