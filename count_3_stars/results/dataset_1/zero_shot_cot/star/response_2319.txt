Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (0, -, -)>
<3, (0, 9, -)>
<4, (8, -, -)>
<5, (0, 6, -)>
<6, (5, -, -)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars present in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
