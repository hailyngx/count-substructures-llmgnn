Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
    - Nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 9 are the center nodes.

Step 2: List out the 3-stars with the center nodes and their connected nodes.
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
