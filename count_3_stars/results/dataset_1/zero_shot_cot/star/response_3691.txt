Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we need to find nodes with 3 edges connected to them. 

The nodes that satisfy this condition are: Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9. 

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

- For Node 0: (1, 7, 8)
- For Node 1: (0, 4, 5, 8)
- For Node 3: (2, 4, 9)
- For Node 4: (1, 3, 7)
- For Node 9: (1, 2, 3)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
