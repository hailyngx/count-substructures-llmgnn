Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list all 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 3)>
<2, (6, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 0, 3)>
<6, (2, 8, 0)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[9]
