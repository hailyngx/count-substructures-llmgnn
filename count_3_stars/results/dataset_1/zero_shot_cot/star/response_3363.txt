Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 4, 5)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2, 5)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 5, 8)
4. Node 3: (3, 4, 6, 7)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 3, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 1, 6)
7. Node 6: (6, 3, 5, 7)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 3, 6)
9. Node 8: (8, 2, 4)
10. Node 9: (9, 1)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>. 

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [8].
