Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph must have exactly three neighbors. Let's identify the central nodes in the given graph and then determine if they have exactly three neighbors.  

Central nodes with exactly three neighbors:  
1. Node 0  
2. Node 3  
3. Node 4  
4. Node 5  

Unique 3-stars in the graph:  
<0, (2, 5, 6)>  
<3, (1, 2, 4)>  
<4, (1, 3, 6)>  
<5, (0, 3, 6)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
