Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. (0, 3, 6)
2. (1, 4, 7)
3. (2, 4, 9)
4. (3, 0, 1)
5. (4, 1, 2)
6. (4, 6, 9)
7. (4, 8, 5)
8. (5, 4, 8)
9. (6, 0, 4)
10. (6, 4, 9)
11. (7, 1, 8)
12. (7, 8, 9)
13. (8, 3, 4)
14. (8, 4, 5)
15. (8, 7, 9)
16. (9, 2, 4)
17. (9, 4, 6)
18. (9, 6, 7)

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in this graph.
