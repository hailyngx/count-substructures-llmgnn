Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected directly to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to the central node. 

Counting the number of 3-stars visually might be confusing given the number of edges, so let's calculate it methodically:

1. Identify all possible 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 9, -)>
- <4, (0, 3, -)>
- <5, (1, 6, -)>
- <6, (0, 5, -)>
- <7, (0, 1, 8)> and <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, -)>

Each unique 3-star is listed above, and the count is [9].
