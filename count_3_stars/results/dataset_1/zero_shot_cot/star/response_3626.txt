Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
