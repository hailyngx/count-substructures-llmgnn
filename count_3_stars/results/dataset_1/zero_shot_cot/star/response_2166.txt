Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-star patterns we find:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
