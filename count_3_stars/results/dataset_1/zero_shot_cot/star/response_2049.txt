Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 6, -)>
5. <4, (0, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (2, 8, -)>
7. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (2, 4, 6)>
9. <8, (4, 5, 7)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
