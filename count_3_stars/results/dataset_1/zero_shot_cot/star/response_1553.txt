Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, any node with degree 3 can potentially be a center. Let's list these nodes:
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 4, 8

Next, let's examine each potential center and see which connections form 3-stars. We will use the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> for each 3-star we find.

For node 1:
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 4:
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 8:
- <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- <8, (6, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>.
