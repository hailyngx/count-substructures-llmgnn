Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaf nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can find the 3-star structures as follows:
1. Central Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8
2. Central Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
