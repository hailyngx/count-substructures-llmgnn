Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, -)>
<1, (7, -, -)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, -)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars we have identified: [4].
