Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
Based on the given edges, the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, identify the three nodes that are connected to them by edges to form a 3-star.
Let's identify the 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 0: <0, (2, 4, 1)>
- For node 1: <1, (4, 6, 5)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 9, 5)>
- For node 3: No 3-star as it does not have exactly 3 edges connected.
- For node 6: <6, (1, 9, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 1)>, <1, (4, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 9, 5)>, and <6, (1, 9, 5)>.

Output: The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
