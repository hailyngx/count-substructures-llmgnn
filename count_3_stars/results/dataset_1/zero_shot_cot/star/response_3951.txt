Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph using the definition provided earlier.

In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's look at each node and identify if it serves as the center of a 3-star.

Node 0: Not the center of a 3-star.
Node 1: Forms a 3-star <1, (3, 5, 6)>.
Node 2: Forms a 3-star <2, (0, 6, 1)>.
Node 3: Forms two 3-stars <3, (1, 6, 8)> and <3, (1, 6, 9)>.
Node 4: Not the center of a 3-star.
Node 5: Forms a 3-star <5, (1, 6, 9)>.
Node 6: Forms four 3-stars <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, and <6, (2, 3, 5)>.
Node 7: Forms a 3-star <7, (1, 5, 8)>.
Node 8: Not the center of a 3-star.
Node 9: Forms two 3-stars <9, (3, 5, 8)> and <9, (3, 5, 9)>.

Count of 3-stars: 9
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 1)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
