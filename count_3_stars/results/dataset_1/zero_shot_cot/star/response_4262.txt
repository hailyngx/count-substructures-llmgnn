Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 8)>
<0, (7, 2, 8)>
<0, (8, 9, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (7, 3, 9)>
<6, (9, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 9, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
