Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Central node: 0
- Leaves: 1, 5, 6
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>

- Central node: 1
- Leaves: 0, 8, (none connected)
- <1, (0, 8, none)>

- Central node: 2
- Leaves: 4, 6, 7
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>

- Central node: 6
- Leaves: 0, 2, 3
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>

There are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
