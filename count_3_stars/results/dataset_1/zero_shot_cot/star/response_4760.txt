Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by identifying all possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: The neighbors of node 0 are 5 and 6. Thus, we have two possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center: 
   - <0, (5, 6)>
   - <0, (6, 5)>

2. Node 1: The neighbors of node 1 are 2 and 6. Thus, we have one possible 3-star with node 1 as the center:
   - <1, (2, 6)>

3. Node 2: The neighbors of node 2 are 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We can form two 3-stars with node 2 as the center: 
   - <2, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (5, 1, 6)>

4. Node 3: The neighbors of node 3 are 4, 8, and 9. We have no 3-stars centered at node 3 because it does not have exactly three neighbors.

5. Node 4: The neighbors of node 4 are 3 and 6. We have one possible 3-star with node 4 as the center:
   - <4, (3, 6)>

6. Node 5: The neighbors of node 5 are 0, 2, and 8. We do not have any 3-stars centered at node 5 since it has more or less than three neighbors.

7. Node 6: The neighbors of node 6 are 0, 1, 2, and 4. We can form one 3-star with node 6 as the center:
   - <6, (0, 1, 2)>

8. Node 7: The neighbors of node 7 are 2, 8, and 9. We do not have any 3-stars centered at node 7 since it does not have exactly three neighbors.

9. Node 8: The neighbors of node 8 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We have one possible 3-star with node 8 as the center:
   - <8, (3, 5, 7)>

10. Node 9: The neighbors of node 9 are 2, 3, and 7. We do not have any 3-stars centered at node 9 because it does not have exactly three neighbors.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 6)>
<0, (6, 5)>
<1, (2, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<4, (3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph = [8]
