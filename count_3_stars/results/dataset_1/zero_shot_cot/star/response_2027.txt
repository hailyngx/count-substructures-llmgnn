Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Given the edges in the graph, we can determine the central nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to 2 other nodes (4 and 6).
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes (3, 5, and 6).
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes (3, 4, and 5).
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 2, and 6).
- Node 4 is connected to 5 other nodes (0, 2, 5, 6, and 7).
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes (1, 2, 4, and 9).
- Node 6 is connected to 5 other nodes (0, 1, 3, 4, and 8).
- Node 7 is connected to 2 other nodes (4 and 8).
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes (6 and 7).
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes (4, 5, and 6).

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 7 central nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
We will go through each central node and find the adjacent nodes to form unique 3-stars.

For node 0:
0 -> (4, 6)
<0, (4, 6)>

For node 1:
1 -> (3, 5, 6)
<1, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 2:
2 -> (3, 4, 5)
<2, (3, 4, 5)>

For node 3:
3 -> (1, 2, 6)
<3, (1, 2, 6)>

For node 5:
5 -> (1, 2, 4)
<5, (1, 2, 4)>

For node 6:
6 -> (0, 1, 3)
6 -> (4, 8, 9)
<6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
9 -> (4, 5, 6)
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
