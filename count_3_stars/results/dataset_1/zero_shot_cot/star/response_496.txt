Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Two 3-stars are centered at node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)> and <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. There are no 3-stars centered at node 1.
3. There is one 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (4, 9, 4)>
4. There is one 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 4, 6)>
5. There is one 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>
6. There is one 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (4, 6, 8)>
7. There is one 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (3, 5, 9)>
8. One 3-star is centered at node 7: <7, (1, 9, 9)>
9. Two 3-stars are centered at node 8: <8, (0, 5, 0)> and <8, (0, 5, 0)>
10. Three 3-stars are centered at node 9: <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, and <9, (1, 6, 2)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [11].
