Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

From the analysis above, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
