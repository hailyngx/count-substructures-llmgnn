Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with degree 3 in the given graph.  

The nodes with degree 3 are 3 and 7. 

Next, we need to check the neighbors of these central nodes to see if they form 3-stars. 

For node 3:
- (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2) -> Form a 3-star <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- (3, 4), (3, 7) -> Form a 3-star <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- (3, 9) -> Form a 3-star <3, (0, 4, 7)>

For node 7:
- (7, 0), (7, 1) -> Form a 3-star <7, (0, 1, 3)>
- (7, 3) -> Form a 3-star <7, (0, 1, 9)>
- (7, 9) -> Form a 3-star <7, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and they are:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>
