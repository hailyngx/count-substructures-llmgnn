Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 0 since it will be the center of the 3-star.
Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.

Now, let's form all possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center and the nodes connected to it as leaves.
1. <0, (5, 7)>
2. <0, (7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 7)> and <0, (7, 5)>.
