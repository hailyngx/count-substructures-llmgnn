Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6: 1, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 2

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars. 

There is 1 three stars with center 2:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>

There is 1 three stars with center 3:
<3, (2, 4, 7)>

There is 1 three stars with center 4:
<4, (3, 7, 8)>

There is 1 three stars with center 5:
<5, (0, 1, 6)>

There is 1 three stars with center 6:
<6, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
