Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are directly connected to node 0:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 (0, 5) and node 5 is connected to nodes 0 (5, 0).
So, there is a potential 3-star centered at node 0. Let's check if it fulfills the conditions for a 3-star:

The edges connected to node 0 are (0, 5) and (5, 0). These form a triangle, which means there is a 3-star at node 0.
Thus, we have found one 3-star: <0, (5)>.

Next, let's see if there are any other potential 3-stars in the graph:

We can observe that nodes 1 and 8 each have one edge connected to them, which means they cannot form 3-stars.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 (2, 1) and 8 (2, 8). This does not form a 3-star.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 (3, 4), 5 (3, 5), 6 (3, 6), and 7 (3, 7). Let's check if it forms a 3-star.
Node 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 each have edges connected to them, so they cannot form 3-stars.

After checking all possibilities, we find that there is only one 3-star in the given graph, which is centered at node 0: <0, (5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
