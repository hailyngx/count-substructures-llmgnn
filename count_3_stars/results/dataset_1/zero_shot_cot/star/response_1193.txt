Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star <0, (1, 6, 8)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 8, forming a 3-star <1, (0, 8)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8, forming a 3-star <2, (3, 5, 8)>.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8, forming a 3-star <3, (8)>.
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star as it only has two edges.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8, forming a 3-star <5, (2, 4, 8)>.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it only has two edges.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4, forming a 3-star <7, (2, 4)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9, forming two 3-stars: <8, (0, 1, 9)> and <8, (2, 3, 5)>.
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star as it only has two edges.

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
