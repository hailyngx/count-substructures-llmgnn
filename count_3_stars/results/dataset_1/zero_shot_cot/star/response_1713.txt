Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 3 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
