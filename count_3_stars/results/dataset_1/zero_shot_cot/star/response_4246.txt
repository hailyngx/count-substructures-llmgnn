Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
