Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then form a 3-star with that node as the center and the three connected nodes as leaves.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7. Node 1 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to four nodes.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 6. Node 2 is not part of any 3-star since it is not connected to at least three other nodes.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6. Node 3 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to more than three nodes.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9. Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 6)>.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 8. Node 5 is not part of any 3-star since it is not connected to at least three other nodes.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4. Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 4)>.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1. Node 7 is not part of any 3-star since it is not connected to at least three other nodes.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. Node 8 is not part of any 3-star since it is not connected to at least three other nodes.
9. Node 9 is connected to node 4. Node 9 is not part of any 3-star since it is not connected to at least three other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
