Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. These nodes are: 2, 6, 8, and 9.

Next, let's find the 3-stars by checking each potential center node:

For center node 2:
- (2, 3, 5)
- (2, 6, 8)

For center node 6:
- (6, 2, 8)
- (6, 8, 9)

For center node 8:
- (8, 2, 4)
- (8, 4, 6)

For center node 9:
- (9, 3, 4)
- (9, 4, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<2, (3, 5), (6, 8)>
<6, (2, 8), (8, 9)>
<8, (2, 4), (4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4), (4, 6)>
