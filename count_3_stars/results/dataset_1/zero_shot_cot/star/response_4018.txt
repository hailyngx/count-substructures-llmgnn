Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 4, 6: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, 8: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, 4: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 0, 2, 4: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, 5: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
