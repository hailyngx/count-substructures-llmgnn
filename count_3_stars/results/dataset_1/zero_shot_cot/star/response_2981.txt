Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph by locating the central nodes connected to exactly three leaves.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars one by one:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 4)>
<2, (3, 7, 0)>
<3, (2, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 0)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
