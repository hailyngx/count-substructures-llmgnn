Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 4)>
7. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
9. <8, (3, 6, 9)>
10. <9, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
