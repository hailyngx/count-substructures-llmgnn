Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (8, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (5, 8, 4)>
4. <3, (6, 9, 2)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 0)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 6)>
7. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
8. <7, (8, 0, 9)>
9. <8, (1, 7, 5)>
10. <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Hence, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
