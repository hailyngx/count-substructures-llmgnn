Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would be the centers of the 3-stars. Looking at the edges, we find that nodes 0, 1, 2, and 8 fit this criterion. 

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each of these center nodes to form 3-stars. 
- For node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 6)
- For node 1: (1, 0, 3)
- For node 2: (2, 1, 8), (2, 6, 7), (2, 7, 8)
- For node 8: (8, 1, 2), (8, 2, 3), (8, 6, 9)

Now, counting the unique 3-stars we found: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 2)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
