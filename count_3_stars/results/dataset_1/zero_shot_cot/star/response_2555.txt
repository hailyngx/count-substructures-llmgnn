Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can start by listing all possible 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, _)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, _)>
<9, (6, 7, _)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
