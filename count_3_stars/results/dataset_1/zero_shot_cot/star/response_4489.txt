Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly three edges.

By examining the edges given, we find two central nodes: Node 0 and Node 1. 

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

For central Node 0:
- Leaves: Nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

For central Node 1:
- Leaves: Nodes 4, 5, 8

Now, let's enumerate all possible 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
