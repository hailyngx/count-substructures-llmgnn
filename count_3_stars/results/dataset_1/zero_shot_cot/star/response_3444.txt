Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2: <2, (3, 5, 9)>
2. Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
3. Node 8: <8, (1, 5, 6)>
4. Node 9: <9, (2, 7, -)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
