Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 8)>
3. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
4. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <7, (1, 2, 9)>
6. <8, (0, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
