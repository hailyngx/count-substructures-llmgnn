Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by locating the central node and its three connected nodes in each case. 

Let's write out the 3-stars one by one:

<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
