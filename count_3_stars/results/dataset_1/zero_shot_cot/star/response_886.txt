Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Look for all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of potential 3-stars.
2. For each central node found, identify the three nodes connected to it. These three nodes will form a 3-star with the central node.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go through the given graph step by step:

Central Node: 1
Connected Nodes: 2, 4, 6, 8
Potential 3-star: (1, 2, 4, 6)
Potential 3-star: (1, 2, 4, 8)
Potential 3-star: (1, 4, 6, 8)
Total 3-stars for central node 1: 3

Central Node: 2
Connected Nodes: 1, 6, 7, 8
Potential 3-star: (2, 1, 6, 7)
Potential 3-star: (2, 1, 6, 8)
Potential 3-star: (2, 1, 7, 8)
Total 3-stars for central node 2: 3

Central Node: 3
Connected Nodes: 0, 6, 7, 9
Potential 3-star: (3, 0, 6, 7)
Potential 3-star: (3, 0, 7, 9)
Total 3-stars for central node 3: 2

Central Node: 4
Connected Nodes: 1, 5, 8, 9
Potential 3-star: (4, 1, 5, 8)
Potential 3-star: (4, 1, 8, 9)
Potential 3-star: (4, 5, 8, 9)
Total 3-stars for central node 4: 3

Central Node: 6
Connected Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 7
Potential 3-star: (6, 1, 2, 3)
Potential 3-star: (6, 1, 2, 7)
Potential 3-star: (6, 1, 3, 7)
Total 3-stars for central node 6: 3

Central Node: 8
Connected Nodes: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9
Potential 3-star: (8, 1, 4, 5)
Potential 3-star: (8, 1, 4, 9)
Potential 3-star: (8, 4, 5, 9)
Total 3-stars for central node 8: 3

Central Node: 9
Connected Nodes: 3, 4, 8
Potential 3-star: (9, 3, 4, 8)
Total 3-stars for central node 9: 1

Count of 3-stars in the graph: 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>.
