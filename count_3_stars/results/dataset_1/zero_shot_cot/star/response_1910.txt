Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (3, 4, 6)
2. Node 2: (4, 6, 8)
3. Node 3: (1, 6, 7)
4. Node 4: (1, 2, 9)
5. Node 5: (7, 8, 9)
6. Node 6: (1, 2, 3)
7. Node 7: (3, 5, 9)
8. Node 8: (2, 5, 9)
9. Node 9: (4, 5, 6)

Count of 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
