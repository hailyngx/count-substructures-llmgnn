Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's determine the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 9, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
