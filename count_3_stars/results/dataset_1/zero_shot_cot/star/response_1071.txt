Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

In the provided graph, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
