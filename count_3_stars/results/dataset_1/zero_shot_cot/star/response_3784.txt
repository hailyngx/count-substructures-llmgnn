Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each set of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 3 is the center, connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6. <3, (4, 5, 6)>
2. Node 4 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7. <4, (1, 3, 7)>
3. Node 6 is the center, connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9. <6, (2, 3, 9)>
4. Node 9 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8. <9, (1, 3, 8)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.]
