Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

    1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3.
    2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7.
    3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
    4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
    5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
    6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
    7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
    8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
    9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
    
    <0, (3, 8, 6)>
    <1, (7, 4, 5)>
    <2, (5, 6, 7)>
    <3, (0, 8, 6)>
    <4, (6, 7, 5)>
    <5, (2, 7, 6)>
    <6, (2, 4, 8)>
    <7, (1, 4, 5)>
    <8, (3, 6, 0)>
    
Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9].
