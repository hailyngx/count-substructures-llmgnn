Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8, which makes it a potential center for 3-stars.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 9.

2. For each potential center node (nodes 4 and 8), check if it forms a 3-star structure.
   - For Node 4:
     - Node 1, Node 5, Node 7 can form a 3-star with Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
     - Node 2, Node 3, Node 8 can form a 3-star with Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 8)>
   - For Node 8:
     - Node 2, Node 4, Node 9 can form a 3-star with Node 8: <8, (2, 4, 9)>
     - However, this 3-star was already counted when considering Node 4 as the center.
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are <4, (1, 5, 7)> and <4, (2, 3, 8)>.
