Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a star-like structure with the node as the center. 

From the given edge list, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 6: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 8: <5, (1, 2, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8: <6, (0, 3, 8)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9: <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
