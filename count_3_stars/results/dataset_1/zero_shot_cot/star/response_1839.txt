Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the two nodes are not directly connected. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can check each node to see if it is part of a 3-star.

Let's go through the nodes one by one to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. It forms a 3-star <0, (2, 3)>.

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. It forms two 3-stars: <1, (4, 6)> and <1, (4, 9)>.

3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9. It forms three 3-stars: <2, (0, 5)>, <2, (0, 6)>, and <2, (0, 9)>.

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to node 0. It does not form a 3-star on its own.

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 6. It forms a 3-star <4, (1, 6)>.

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7. It does not form a 3-star on its own.

7. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4. It forms one 3-star: <6, (1, 4)>.

8. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. It does not form a 3-star on its own.

9. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to node 7. It does not form a 3-star on its own.

10. Node 9:
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. It forms a 3-star <9, (1, 2)>.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3)>, <1, (4, 6)>, <1, (4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5)>, <2, (0, 6)>, <2, (0, 9)>, <4, (1, 6)>, <6, (1, 4)>, <9, (1, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
