Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present based on the given edges. 

Let's start by identifying each 3-star in the graph:

1. Node 8 as the center:
   - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <8, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <8, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <8, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <8, (7, 9, 2)>

2. Node 6 as the center:
   - <6, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <6, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <6, (5, 6, 1)>

3. Node 3 as the center:
   - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <3, (7, 9, 2)>
   - <3, (9, 2, 6)>
   - <3, (2, 6, 5)>
   
We have found a total of 15 unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 2)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 2)>, <3, (9, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
