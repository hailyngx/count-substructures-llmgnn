Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes based on the given edges:

- Central node 0 with adjacent nodes 3 and 8.
- Central node 1 with adjacent nodes 7 and 9.
- Central node 2 with adjacent nodes 3 and 4.
- Central node 3 with adjacent nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6.
- Central node 4 with adjacent nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Central node 5 with adjacent node 8.
- Central node 6 with adjacent node 3.
- Central node 7 with adjacent nodes 1 and 4.
- Central node 8 with adjacent nodes 0 and 5.
- Central node 9 with adjacent nodes 1 and 4.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Central node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 2 can form 0 3-stars.
- Central node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 4 can form 2 3-stars.
- Central node 5 can form 0 3-stars.
- Central node 6 can form 0 3-stars.
- Central node 7 can form 0 3-stars.
- Central node 8 can form 0 3-stars.
- Central node 9 can form 0 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8)>
<1, (7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
