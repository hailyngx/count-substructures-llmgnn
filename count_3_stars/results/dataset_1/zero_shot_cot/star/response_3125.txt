Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
