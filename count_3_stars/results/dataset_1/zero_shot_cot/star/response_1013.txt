Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 9)>
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 9)>
4. Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 4)> <3, (2, 5, 7)> <3, (4, 8, 9)>
5. Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)> <4, (2, 8, 9)>
6. Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 8)>
7. Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 5)>

So, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
