Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 3, 6.
- Node 5 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 2, 6.
- Node 6 is the center of the 3-stars with leaves 1, 4, 5.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6)>
<5, (2, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
