Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting with node 1: 
    - Node 1 is connected to node 8. Possible 3-stars:
        - <1, (8, 9, 0)>

2. Moving on to node 2: 
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7. Possible 3-stars:
        - <2, (5, 6, 7)>

3. Exploring node 3:  
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. Possible 3-stars:
        - <3, (5, 7, 0)>

4. Focusing on node 5: 
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6. Possible 3-stars:
        - <5, (2, 3, 6)>

5. Looking at node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5. Possible 3-stars:
        - <6, (2, 5, 0)>

6. Finally, node 8:
    - Node 8 is connected to node 1. Possible 3-stars:
        - <8, (1, 9, 0)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
 
Here are the unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 0)>, <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 5, 0)>, <8, (1, 9, 0)>
