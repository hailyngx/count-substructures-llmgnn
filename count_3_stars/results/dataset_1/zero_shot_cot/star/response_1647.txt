Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves to form 3-stars. 

The central nodes are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 5)>
<5, (4, 9, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (7, 9, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
