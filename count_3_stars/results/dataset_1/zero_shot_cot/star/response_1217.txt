Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Identify Central Node:** Look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

2. **Identify Adjacent Nodes:** For each central node found in step 1, find the nodes that are directly connected to it.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

1. Central Node: 1, Adjacent Nodes: 2, 4, 7
2. Central Node: 2, Adjacent Nodes: 1, 4, 7
3. Central Node: 4, Adjacent Nodes: 1, 2, 5
4. Central Node: 6, Adjacent Nodes: 1, 4, 5
5. Central Node: 7, Adjacent Nodes: 1, 2, 4

Finally, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:

- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
