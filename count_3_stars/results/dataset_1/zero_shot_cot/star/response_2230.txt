Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Given the edges provided, we will search for nodes that form 3-stars and count them. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has three edges, but none of them form a 3-star pattern.
2. Node 1 has two edges, which is not sufficient for a 3-star.
3. Node 2 has five edges: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 4), (2, 5), and (2, 8). 
    - From these edges, we can identify two 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 5)> and <2, (1, 4, 5)>.
4. Node 3 has three edges but does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 is part of the 3-star with node 2.
6. Node 5 is part of the 3-star with node 2.
7. Node 6 only has one edge, which is not enough for a 3-star.
8. Node 8 has four edges: (2, 8), (3, 8), (5, 8), and (6, 8).
    - From these edges, we can identify one 3-star: <8, (2, 3, 5)>.
9. Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Combining the identified 3-stars, we have the following unique instances:
<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
