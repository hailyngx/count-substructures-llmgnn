Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes. Central nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them.  
Step 2: For each central node, identify the unique 3-stars formed by the central node and its connected nodes.  
Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.  

Let's go through the steps:  

Step 1:  
The central nodes in this graph are node 1 and node 3.  

Step 2:  
For node 1:  
<1, (2, 4, 5)>  
<1, (2, 5, 6)>  

For node 3:  
<3, (2, 7, 9)>  
<3, (7, 9, 8)>  

Step 3:  
Total unique 3-stars: 4  

Therefore, the answer is [4].  
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 8)>.
