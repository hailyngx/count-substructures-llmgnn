Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 9, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
