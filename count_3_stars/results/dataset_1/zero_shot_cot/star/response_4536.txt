Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes in the graph that satisfy this criterion.

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.

2. Form the 3-stars based on the identified central nodes:
   - Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 7)>
   - Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 6)>
   - Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
   - Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>
   - Node 8: <8, (5, 6, 8)>

Now, we have identified the unique 3-stars in the given graph. Let's count them and put the final answer inside brackets:
