Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible combinations of 3-stars.

Let's list the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (5, 7, 6)>
2. <1, (5, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (5, 1, 4)>
4. <4, (5, 3, 1)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
6. <6, (5, 7, 0)>
7. <7, (0, 6, 5)>

After identifying all the unique 3-stars, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [7].
