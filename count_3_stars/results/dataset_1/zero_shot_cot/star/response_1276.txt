Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 5), (0, 5, 6), (0, 6, 2)
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 4, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 7, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 2)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 8)
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 8), (6, 1, 8)
8. Node 7: (7, 3, 9)
9. Node 8: (8, 5, 6), (8, 6, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 7), (9, 7, 8)

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, _)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, _)>, <4, (1, 2, _)>, <5, (0, 8, _)>, <6, (0, 8, _)>, <7, (3, 9, _)>, <8, (5, 6, _)>, <9, (2, 7, _)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
