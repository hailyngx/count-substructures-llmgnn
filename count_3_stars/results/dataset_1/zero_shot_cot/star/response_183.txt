Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will form the central node of a 3-star. Let's list the 3-stars below:

<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 0, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 1, 0)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

[There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.]
