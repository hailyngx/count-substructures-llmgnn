Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges attached to them. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars.  
Nodes with 3 edges: 0, 3, 4, 9

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if the nodes connected to it by edges form a 3-star pattern (center node + 3 other nodes).  
Starting with node 0:  
- (0, 6), (0, 9) -> <0, (6, 9)>  

Moving to node 3:  
- (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3) -> No 3-star  

Moving to node 4:  
- (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 9) -> <4, (3, 6, 9)>  

Moving to node 9:  
- (9, 0), (9, 4) -> <9, (0, 4)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
[2]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
Unique 3-stars found:  
<0, (6, 9)>  
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
