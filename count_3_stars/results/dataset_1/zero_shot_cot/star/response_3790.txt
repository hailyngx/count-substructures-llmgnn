Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for every node that has exactly 3 adjacent nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 has 3 adjacent nodes: 3, 6, 7
   - <0, (3, 6, 7)>

2. Node 1 has 3 adjacent nodes: 2, 5, 6
   - <1, (2, 5, 6)>

3. Node 2 has 3 adjacent nodes: 1, 5, 7
   - <2, (1, 5, 7)>

4. Node 3 has 2 adjacent nodes, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

5. Node 5 has 3 adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 9
   - <5, (1, 2, 9)>

6. Node 6 has 3 adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 3
   - <6, (0, 1, 3)>

7. Node 7 has 2 adjacent nodes, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

8. Nodes 8 and 9 both have 1 adjacent node each, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, and <5, (1, 2, 9)>.
