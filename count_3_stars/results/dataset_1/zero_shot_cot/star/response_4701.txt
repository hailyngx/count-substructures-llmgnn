Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. Let's analyze the given graph:

The central node should be connected by exactly three edges to form a 3-star. Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
