Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 1)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 1)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
5. <5, (1, 4, -)>
6. <6, (7, -, -)>
7. <7, (2, 8, 9)>
8. <8, (4, 7, -)>
9. <9, (7, -, -)>

Therefore, there are 9 3-star structures in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
