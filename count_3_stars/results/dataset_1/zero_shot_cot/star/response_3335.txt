Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. These are the nodes with exactly three incident edges. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 2, 4, 6, and 9 are the central nodes.

Now, let's look at each central node and identify the 3-stars that can be formed around them. 

For node 2:
- <2, (4, 3, 6)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (6, 5, 7)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 6:
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <6, (4, 3, 6)>
- <6, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 9:
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (6, 5, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
