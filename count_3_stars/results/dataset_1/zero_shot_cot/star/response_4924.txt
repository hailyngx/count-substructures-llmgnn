Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in this graph. 

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated using the formula: Total 3-stars = Number of nodes - Total nodes not in 3-stars - Central nodes. 

1. Let's first identify the nodes that are not part of any 3-star configuration:
- Nodes with only 1 neighbor are not part of any 3-star configuration as a 3-star requires at least 2 connections.
   In this case, nodes 8 and 5 are not part of any 3-star configuration.

2. Next, we identify the central nodes for 3-stars:
- Nodes with degree 3 can be central nodes of 3-star configurations.
   In this case, nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 can act as central nodes.

3. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars configurations:

<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>

4. Finally, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Total 3-stars = 10 - 2 - 6 = 2 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
