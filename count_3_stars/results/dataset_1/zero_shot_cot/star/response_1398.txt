Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star. We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify a few potential 3-star structures:
- Node 0 connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4
- Node 2 connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7
- Node 3 connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7
- Node 4 connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8
- Node 6 connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2
- Node 8 connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars from these potential structures: 

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>

There are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
