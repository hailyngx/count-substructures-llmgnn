Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star structures:
- Node 0 has connections to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 has connections to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 has connections to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 has connections to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 8 has connections to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 9 has connections to nodes 0 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
