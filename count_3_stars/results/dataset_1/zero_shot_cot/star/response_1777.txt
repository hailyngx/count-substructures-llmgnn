Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A central node in a 3-star graph is any node that has exactly three edges connected to it. In this case, nodes 0 and 4 are central nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars with central nodes 0 and 4:

For central node 0:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 1, 8)>

For central node 4:
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <4, (6, 3, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we have: [4].
