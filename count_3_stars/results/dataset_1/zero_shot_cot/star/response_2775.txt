Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 7. Hence, a 3-star is formed with node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 6, and 7 as the leaves. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 6. Hence, a 3-star is formed with node 2 as the center and nodes 1, 5, and 6 as the leaves. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 8. Hence, a 3-star is formed with node 4 as the center and nodes 0, 5, and 8 as the leaves. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
4. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 7. Hence, a 3-star is formed with node 6 as the center and nodes 1, 2, and 7 as the leaves. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
5. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 9. Hence, a 3-star is formed with node 7 as the center and nodes 1, 3, and 9 as the leaves. <7, (1, 3, 9)>
6. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 9. Hence, a 3-star is formed with node 8 as the center and nodes 0, 5, and 9 as the leaves. <8, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
