Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., a central node connected to three leaves). 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 6.
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 4.
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7.
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4.
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 9.
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 7.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (8, 9, 6)>
<1, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
