Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.

To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6)>
<3, (7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 6)>
<6, (2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
[9]
