Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify the central nodes of each 3-star. A central node is a node with exactly 3 incident edges. 

Central Nodes:
- 0 (degree: 4)
- 1 (degree: 6)
- 4 (degree: 4)
- 5 (degree: 4)
- 7 (degree: 3)
- 8 (degree: 3)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Central Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Central Node 1: 1 3-star [(1, 5, 6)]
- Central Node 4: 1 3-star [(4, 1, 8)]
- Central Node 5: 1 3-star [(5, 0, 9)]
- Central Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Central Node 8: 1 3-star [(8, 4, 9)]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

<1, (5, 6, -1)>, <4, (1, 8, -1)>, <5, (0, 9, -1)>
