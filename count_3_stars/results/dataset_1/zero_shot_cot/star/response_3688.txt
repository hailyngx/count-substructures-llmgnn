Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify nodes with their connections.  

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

We can find three-star patterns by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
These are:
- Node 0 with nodes 1, 4, 8
- Node 0 with nodes 1, 4, 9
- Node 0 with nodes 4, 7, 8
- Node 0 with nodes 4, 7, 9
- Node 1 with nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 4 with nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 4 with nodes 0, 6, 8
- Node 4 with nodes 1, 6, 10
- Node 4 with nodes 6, 8, 9
- Node 7 with nodes 0, 3, 5
- Node 9 with nodes 0, 2, 6
- Node 9 with nodes 0, 6, 7

Finally, counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the graph.  

Thus, the 10 unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 10)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
