Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
