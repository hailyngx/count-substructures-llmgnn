Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

Nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[5]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
