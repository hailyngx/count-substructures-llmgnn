Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the central node in a 3-star. A central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given graph, the nodes with degree 3 are: 4, 5, and 7.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3].
