Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
