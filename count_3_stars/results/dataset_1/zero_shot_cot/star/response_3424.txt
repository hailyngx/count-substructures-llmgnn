Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9: <0, (2, 3, 9)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7: <1, (6, 7)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7: <3, (0, 2, 7)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7: <6, (1, 5, 7)>
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 6: <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
