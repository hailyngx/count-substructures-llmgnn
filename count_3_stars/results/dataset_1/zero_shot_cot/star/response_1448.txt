Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the graph.
    - Node 1, Node 4, and Node 7 have degree 3, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars. 
    
Step 2: For each potential central node, identify the adjacent nodes that form a 3-star.
    For Node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to Node 4, Node 5, and Node 8. Hence, <1, (4, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.
    
    For Node 4:
    - Node 4 is connected to Node 1, Node 3, and Node 9. Hence, <4, (1, 3, 9)> is a 3-star.
    
    For Node 7:
    - Node 7 is connected to Node 2, Node 5, and Node 9. Hence, <7, (2, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.
    
Step 3: Determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
    There are 3 unique 3-stars found in the graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Final Answer: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>
