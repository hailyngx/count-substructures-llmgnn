Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step to find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. So, the 3-star with node 0 as the center is <0, (2, 5, 8)>.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. However, since it only has two connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 6. However, it doesn't have a 3rd connection to form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. However, it doesn't have a 3rd connection to form a 3-star.

5. Node 4 is connected to node 8. Since it only has one connection, it cannot form a 3-star.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, and 7. It has 5 connections, forming multiple 3-stars.  
    <5, (0, 1, 3)>  
    <5, (0, 6, 7)>  

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. It has 4 connections, forming a 3-star.
    <6, (2, 5, 7)>  

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. However, it doesn't have a 3rd connection to form a 3-star.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4. It forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center <8, (0, 1, 4)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
