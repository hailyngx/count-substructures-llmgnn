Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors connected by edges. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, and 8.
2. Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 8.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, and 6.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 8.
5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 7.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, and 8.
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, and 8.
8. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 6.
9. Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
10. Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 8.

From the analysis above, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
