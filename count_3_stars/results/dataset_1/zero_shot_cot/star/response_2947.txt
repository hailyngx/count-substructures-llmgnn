Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
