Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are endpoints of edges connected to node 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 respectively.

Node 0: 3
Node 1: None
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 0, 4, 6
Node 4: 3, 5, 6
Node 5: 2, 4, 7
Node 6: 3, 4, 8
Node 7: 5, 9
Node 8: 6, 9
Node 9: 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
As per the definition of a 3-star graph, a 3-star is formed with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph and then count them:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, None)>
<8, (6, 9)>
<9, (7, 8)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
