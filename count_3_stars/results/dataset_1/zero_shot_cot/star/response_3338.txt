Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: (1, 3, 6) [1]
- Node 1: (0, 7, 9) [2]
- Node 2: (7, 9, 5) [3]
- Node 3: (0)
- Node 4: (7)
- Node 5: (9)
- Node 6: (0, 9)
- Node 7: (1, 2, 4) [4]
- Node 8: (9)
- Node 9: (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8) [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 9, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, and <9, (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8)>.
