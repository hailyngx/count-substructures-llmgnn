Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes with 3 connections:
   - Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)
   - Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)
   - Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 7)
   - Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 9)
   - Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 4)

2. Total number of 3-star configurations:
   - Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
   - Node 2: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
   - Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (7, 1, 0)>, <4, (5, 4, 0)>
   - Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 9)>
   - Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 2)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (7, 1, 0)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
