Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9. Thus, <1, (2, 3, 8)> and <1, (2, 3, 9)> are two 3-stars.
2. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9. Thus, <8, (0, 1, 7)> and <8, (0, 1, 9)> are two 3-stars.

Count of 3-stars: [4]  
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>
