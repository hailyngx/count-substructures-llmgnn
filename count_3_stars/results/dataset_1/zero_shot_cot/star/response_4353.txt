Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

There are a total of 5 nodes connected to node 0:
- Connected nodes: 2, 6, 7, 8

So, there are 4 possible 3-stars with center node 0:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 2)>

Similarly, there are 2 possible 3-stars with center node 2:
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>

And there is 1 possible 3-star with center node 5:
<5, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
