Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each identified node, check if it forms a 3-star configuration.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, let's check for 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 3, 4)> - 3-star with node 0 as the central node and nodes 1, 3, and 4 as leaves.
<0, (1, 3, 8)> - 3-star with node 0 as the central node and nodes 1, 3, and 8 as leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (1, 3, 4)>  
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
