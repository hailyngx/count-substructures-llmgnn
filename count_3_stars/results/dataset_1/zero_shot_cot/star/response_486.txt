Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>  
<1, (0, 6, 9)>  
<2, (4, 5, 6)>  
<3, (0, 5, 8)>  
<4, (2, 9, 5)>  
<5, (2, 3, 9)>  
<6, (1, 2, 9)>  
<7, (6, 8, 1)>  
<8, (3, 7, 9)>  
<9, (1, 6, 4)>  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [9].
