Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node and its three connected nodes. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (1)>
<4, (0, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (6)>
<8, (2)>
<9, (2)>

Since there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [9].
