Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Central node 0:
   - Leaves: Node 3, Node 9
   - <0, (3, 9)>

2. Central node 1:
   - Leaves: Node 9
   - <1, (9)>

3. Central node 2: 
   - Leaves: Node 3, Node 6
   - <2, (3, 6)>

4. Central node 3:
   - Leaves: Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9
   - <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)> 

5. Central node 4:
   - Leaves: Node 3, Node 9
   - <4, (3, 9)>

6. Central node 5:
   - Leaves: Node 6, Node 7
   - <5, (6, 7)>

7. Central node 6:
   - Leaves: Node 2, Node 3, Node 5
   - <6, (2, 3, 5)>

8. Central node 7:
   - Leaves: Node 5
   - <7, (5)>

9. Central node 8:
   - Leaves: Node 3, Node 9
   - <8, (3, 9)>

10. Central node 9:
    - Leaves: Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 8
    - <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 8, 3)>, <9, (1, 9, 3)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [15]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 9)>, <1, (9)>, <2, (3, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 9)>, <5, (6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (5)>, <8, (3, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 9, 3)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>
