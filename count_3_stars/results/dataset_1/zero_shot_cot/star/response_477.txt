Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes (making it the center of a 3-star). 

Looking at the edges given:
- Node 0 is connected to {3, 5, 7}
- Node 1 is connected to {6, 8}
- Node 2 is connected to {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3 is connected to {0, 2}
- Node 4 is connected to {6}
- Node 5 is connected to {0, 9}
- Node 6 is connected to {1, 2, 4}
- Node 7 is connected to {0, 2}
- Node 8 is connected to {1}
- Node 9 is connected to {2, 5}

From the connections above, we can see the following 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 5, 9)>

Hence, there are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
