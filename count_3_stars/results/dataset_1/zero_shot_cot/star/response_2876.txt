Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) and their adjacent nodes.

First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 7
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
- <0, (4, 5, 1)>
- <1, (4, 8, 0)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 5, 5)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
