Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Count the number of 3-stars in the graph [ ].

2. List the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (7, 9, 5)>
<3, (5)>
<4, (6)>
<8, (7)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
