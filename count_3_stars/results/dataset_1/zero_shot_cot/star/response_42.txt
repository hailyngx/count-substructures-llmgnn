Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 7, 1)>
2. <3, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (1, 3, 9)>
4. <7, (0, 8, 9)>
5. <9, (2, 5, 7)>
