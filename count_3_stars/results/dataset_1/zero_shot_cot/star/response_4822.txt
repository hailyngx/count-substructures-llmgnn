Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes that are adjacent to exactly three other nodes. 
From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with their adjacent nodes:
- Node 1 is adjacent to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 2 is adjacent to node 1.
- Node 3 is adjacent to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 4 is adjacent to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 5 is adjacent to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is adjacent to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is adjacent to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is adjacent to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is adjacent to nodes 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 7)>
<3, (5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6)>
<8, (3, 4)>
<9, (6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
