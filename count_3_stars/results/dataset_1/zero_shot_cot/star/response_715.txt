Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to search for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

By examining the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, -)>
<4, (0, 2, -)>
<5, (1, 3, -)>
<6, (7, 8, -)>
<7, (2, 6, -)>
<8, (6, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
