Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected by exactly three edges, forming a 3-star with that node as the center. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Node 2:
   - 3-star: <2, (4, 6, 7)>

2. Node 3:
   - 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 0)>

3. Node 4:
   - 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 7)>
   - 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 2)>

4. Node 5:
   - 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 7)>
   - 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 3)>

5. Node 7:
   - 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 2)>
   - 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 0)>

6. Node 8:
   - 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 9)>
   - 3-star: <8, (1, 9, 0)>

7. Node 9:
   - 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 7)>
   - 3-star: <9, (3, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>.
