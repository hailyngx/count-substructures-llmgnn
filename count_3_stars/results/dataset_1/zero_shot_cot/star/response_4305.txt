Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are directly connected to the center node in the 3-star motif. The center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, node 0 is the only node connected to three other nodes (5, 7, and 8). 

Now, let's form the 3-stars using node 0 as the center node and the nodes connected to it as the leaves. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars. 

The final answer is [1].
