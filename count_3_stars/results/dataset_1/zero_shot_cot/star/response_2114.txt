Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-star configurations. 

Looking at the graph, we can see that the nodes with the potential to be the center of 3-star configurations are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Let's list the 3-stars:  
<0, (1, 8, 9)>  
<(1), (0, 3, 4)>  
<(2), (4, 5, 8)>  
<3, (1, 9, NA)>  
<(4), (1, 2, 9)>  
<(5), (1, 2, 8)>  
<(6), (2, NA, NA)>  
<(8), (0, 2, 5)>  
<9, (1, 3, 4)>  

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 
[9]
