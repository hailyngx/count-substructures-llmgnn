Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
In this graph, nodes 2 and 6 have exactly 3 neighbors. 

Step 2: For each central node, find the connected nodes.
For node 2: Nodes 3, 4, and 5 are connected.
For node 6: Node 3, 5, and 8 are connected.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>

Step 4: Count the number of 3-stars.
