Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node in each potential 3-star. Then we check if the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's analyze the graph step by step.

The 3-star structures can be formed with central nodes: 0, 1, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. Since it is connected to exactly 2 nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. Since it is connected to exactly 2 nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For node 8:
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9. Since it is connected to exactly 2 nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

For node 9:
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8. Since it is connected to more than 3 nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are no unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [0]
