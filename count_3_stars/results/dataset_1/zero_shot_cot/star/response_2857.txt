Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a 3-star. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, -)>
<5, (2, 7, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, -)>
<9, (7, -, -)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
