Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to the center node (degree 3).

Nodes with degree 3: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9

Now, we can find the 3-stars in the graph by checking all possible combinations of connections between the center node and the nodes with degree 3.

Let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (7, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
