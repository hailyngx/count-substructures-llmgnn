Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one to see if they form any 3-stars.

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8)
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 3, 8)>

2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
    - <1, (0, 2, 6)>
    - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (0, 7, 9)>

3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7)
    - No 3-star centered at node 2.

4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9)
    - <3, (0, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (0, 8, 9)>

5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2)
    - No 3-star centered at node 4.

6. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 8)
    - <5, (3, 6, 8)>

7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7)
    - <6, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <6, (1, 5, 7)>

8. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 8)
    - No 3-star centered at node 7.

9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
    - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <8, (0, 7, 9)>

10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 8)
    - No 3-star centered at node 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [14].
