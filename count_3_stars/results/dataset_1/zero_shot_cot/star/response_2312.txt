Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 8
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 5, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: {4, 6, 8}, {4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 5}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 0}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 0}

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 5)>, and <3, (5, 9, 0)>.
