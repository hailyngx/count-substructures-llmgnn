Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

The central nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9

The 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, X)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, X)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 5 in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
