Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The center of the 3-star can be any node in the graph. We will check each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the graph, we find that there are four 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them:
    
    <0, (1, 2, 8)>
    <1, (0, 3, 6)>
    <3, (1, 4, 7)>
    <8, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
