Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
