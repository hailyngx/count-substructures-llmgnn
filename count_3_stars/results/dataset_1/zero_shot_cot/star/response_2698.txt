Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all the nodes connected to each node:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 9
Node 2: 3, 4, 5
Node 3: 2, 5, 8
Node 4: 2, 5
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 6: 7
Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 3, 7, 9
Node 9: 1, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
