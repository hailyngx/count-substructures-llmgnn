Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Starting with node 0 as the center, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
