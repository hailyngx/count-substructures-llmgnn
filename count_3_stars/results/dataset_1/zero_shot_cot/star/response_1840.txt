Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph using the given edges: 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, hence the final answer is [4].
