Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- From node 1: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- From node 3: <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- From node 4: <4, (5, 9, -)>
- From node 5: <5, (4, -, -)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 1, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
- From node 9: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, we have identified 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
