Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have a degree of 3.

From the given graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, and 5 have degrees of 6, 4, 4, 6, and 4 respectively. None of these nodes have a degree of 3, so none of them can be central nodes of 3-stars. 

Next, let's identify the leaves of the 3-stars. For each node in the graph, we need to check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

- Node 3 is not connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and another node.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and another node.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and another node.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.

So, the only possible 3-stars in the graph are:

<4, (0, 9, x)>
<7, (0, 2, x)>
<8, (0, 6, x)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Since there are 4 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [4].
