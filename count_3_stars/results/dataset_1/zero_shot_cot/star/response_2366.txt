Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 5, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 6, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 2, 8), (5, 2, 9), (5, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 4, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 1, 3), (7, 0, 5), (7, 1, 8), (7, 1, 9), (7, 3, 6), (7, 6, 8), (7, 6, 9), (7, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 1, 7), (8, 5, 2), (8, 5, 7), (8, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 1, 7), (9, 2, 5), (9, 2, 7), (9, 5, 8), (9, 7, 8)

There are a total of 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [19].
