Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, form a 3-star with the current node as the center and the three connected nodes as leaves.

2. Based on the provided edges, we find the following 3-stars:
    - <0, (3, 4, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
    - <2, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <3, (0, 7, 'Not a 3-star')>
    - <4, (0, 'Not a 3-star', 'Not a 3-star')>
    - <5, (1, 'Not a 3-star', 'Not a 3-star')>
    - <6, (2, 7, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <8, (7, 'Not a 3-star', 'Not a 3-star')>
    - <9, (6, 'Not a 3-star', 'Not a 3-star')>

3. The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
