Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node and organize the information:

Node 0: 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 1: 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 0, 4, 6
Node 3: 4, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 5: 4, 7
Node 6: 1, 2
Node 7: 1, 4, 5
Node 8: 0, 3, 4
Node 9: 0, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
We will look for each node with exactly three neighbors and check if they form a 3-star.

- Checking node 0: (0, 2, 4, 8), (0, 2, 4, 9), (0, 4, 8, 9) -> 3 possible 3-stars
- Checking node 1: does not have exactly 3 neighbors
- Checking node 2: (2, 0, 4, 6) -> 1 3-star
- Checking node 3: does not have exactly 3 neighbors
- Checking node 4: (4, 0, 2, 9) -> 1 3-star
- Checking node 5: does not have exactly 3 neighbors
- Checking node 6: (6, 1, 2, 0) -> 1 3-star
- Checking node 7: does not have exactly 3 neighbors
- Checking node 8: does not have exactly 3 neighbors
- Checking node 9: does not have exactly 3 neighbors

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
