Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars.

1. Since the graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges, let's start by listing the neighbors of each node:
   - Node 0: 1, 7, 8
   - Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 9
   - Node 2: 4, 5, 8, 9
   - Node 3: 1, 5
   - Node 4: 2
   - Node 5: 2, 3, 6, 7
   - Node 6: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
   - Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8
   - Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
   - Node 9: 1, 2, 6

2. Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - From the neighbors listed above, it's clear that not all nodes can form a 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars by checking each node:
     - Node 0: Cannot form a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.
     - Node 1: Forms a 3-star <1, (0, 6, 9)>.
     - Node 2: Cannot form a 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
     - Node 3: Cannot form a 3-star since it has 2 neighbors.
     - Node 4: Cannot form a 3-star since it has only 1 neighbor.
     - Node 5: Forms a 3-star <5, (2, 6, 7)>.
     - Node 6: Forms a 3-star <6, (1, 5, 7)>.
     - Node 7: Cannot form a 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
     - Node 8: Cannot form a 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.
     - Node 9: Cannot form a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

3. Count of 3-stars: [2]
   
4. List of 3-stars:
   - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 6, 7)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
