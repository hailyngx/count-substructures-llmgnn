Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The count of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<0, (8, 9, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 5)>
<2, (9, 0, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 9, 1)>
