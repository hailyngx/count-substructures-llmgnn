Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
    - Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5
    - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
    - Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 8
    - Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
    - Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
    - Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 8

Step 2: Count the number of 3-star graphs.
    - There are 2 possible 3-star graphs with the center as node 0.
    - There are 3 possible 3-star graphs with the center as node 2.
    - There are 5 possible 3-star graphs with the center as node 3.
    - There are 3 possible 3-star graphs with the center as node 5.
    - There are 5 possible 3-star graphs with the center as node 8.
    - There are 3 possible 3-star graphs with the center as node 9.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
    <0, (2, 3, 5)>
    <2, (0, 5, 9)>
    <3, (0, 1, 6)>
    <3, (0, 7, 8)>
    <5, (0, 2, 9)>
    <8, (3, 4, 6)>
    <8, (3, 7, 9)>
    <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
