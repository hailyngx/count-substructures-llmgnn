Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
    
1. Nodes (4, 3, 6)
2. Nodes (5, 6, 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].

<4, (3, 6, -)>  
<5, (6, 8, -)>
