Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 1: Forms one 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 2: Forms zero 3-stars
- Node 3: Forms zero 3-stars
- Node 4: Forms one 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: Forms zero 3-stars
- Node 6: Forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 7)> and <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: Forms two 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 6)> and <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 8: Forms zero 3-stars
- Node 9: Forms zero 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
