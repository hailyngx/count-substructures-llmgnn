Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 1, Leaves: 0, 2, 7
2. Central node: 2, Leaves: 1, 3, 5
3. Central node: 4, Leaves: 3, 7, 9
4. Central node: 7, Leaves: 0, 1, 4

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
