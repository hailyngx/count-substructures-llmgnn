Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 2, 4, and 7. This forms a 3-star with the center node 0 and the leaves 2, 4, and 7.
2. Node 1 has edges with nodes 3 and 9. However, this does not form a 3-star since there are only two leaves connected to the center node.
3. Node 2 has edges with nodes 0, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star with the center node 2 and the leaves 0, 3, and 4.
4. Node 6 has edges with nodes 4, 5, and 9. This forms a 3-star with the center node 6 and the leaves 4, 5, and 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
