Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 7)>
3. <3, (6, 8, 8)>
4. <5, (1, 6, 6)>
5. <6, (3, 5, 6)>
6. <8, (2, 3, 4)>
7. <9, (0, 0, 0)>

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the output is [7].
