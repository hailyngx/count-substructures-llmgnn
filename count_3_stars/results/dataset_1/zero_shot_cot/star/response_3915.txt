Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges incident on them. These nodes will be the central nodes in our 3-stars. From the given edges, nodes 3, 5, and 9 satisfy this condition.

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <9, (6, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
