Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [12]. 
So, the final answer is [12].
