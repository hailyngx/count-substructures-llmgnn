Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the graph.
