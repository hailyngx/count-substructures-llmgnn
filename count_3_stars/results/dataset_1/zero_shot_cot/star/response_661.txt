Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (8, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [7].
