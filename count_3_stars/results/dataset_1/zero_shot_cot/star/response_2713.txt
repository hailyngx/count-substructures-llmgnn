Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<4, (2, 0, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (1, 0, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

Now, we count these 3-stars:
