Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors). 

Central nodes: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now let's list the 3-stars in the graph. 

<2, (3, 7, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
