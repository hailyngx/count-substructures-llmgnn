Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[6]
