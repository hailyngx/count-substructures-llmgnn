Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list and count these 3-stars step by step.

Given the edges:
(0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 7), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 8), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)
   <4, (1, 3, 5)>

2. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4)
   <5, (0, 3, 4)>

3. Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)
   <8, (4, 5, 6)>

4. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4)
   <9, (1, 3, 4)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is given by the count of unique 3-stars, which is [4]. 

Therefore, the answer is [4].
