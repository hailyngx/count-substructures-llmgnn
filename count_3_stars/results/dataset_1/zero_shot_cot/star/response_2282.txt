Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will look for all possible 3-star configurations in the given graph.

1. Node 0:
    - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
    
2. Node 1:
    - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
    
3. Node 2:
    - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
    
4. Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 9)>
    
5. Node 4:
    - <4, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 7)>
    
6. Node 5:
    - <5, (1, 2, 7)>
    
7. Node 6:
    - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
    
8. Node 7:
    - <7, (4, 5, 6)>
    
9. Node 8:
    - <8, (2, 9, 8)>
    
10. Node 9:
    - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
    - <9, (3, 6, 8)>
    
Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
