Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's analyze the graph based on the provided edges:

- Nodes 0, 2, 3 form a 3-star. <0, (2, 3)>
- Nodes 1, 4, 9 form a 3-star. <1, (4, 9)>
- Nodes 2, 8, 7 form a 3-star. <2, (8, 7)>
- Nodes 2, 5, 8 do not form a 3-star as there are 4 edges connected to node 2.
- Nodes 8, 6, 2 form a 3-star. <8, (6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
<List of 3-stars: <0, (2, 3)>, <1, (4, 9)>, <2, (8, 7)>]
