Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center node in each potential 3-star.  
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we need to identify nodes which have exactly three edges connected to them.
- Nodes 0, 5, and 7 have 2 edges each.
- Nodes 1, 2, and 3 have 4 edges each.
- Nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 5 edges each.

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars.  
We can see that nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 4 or 5 edges, which means they could potentially be the center nodes of 3-stars.

- For node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8)
    <1, (0, 4, 6)>
    <1, (0, 4, 8)>
    <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9)
    <4, (0, 1, 6)>
    <4, (0, 1, 8)>
    <4, (1, 6, 8)>
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 9)
    <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- For node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 9)
    <8, (1, 2, 4)>
    <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- For node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)
    <9, (2, 3, 4)>
    <9, (2, 4, 6)>
    <9, (2, 4, 8)>
    <9, (4, 5, 6)>
    <9, (4, 6, 8)>
    <9, (4, 6, 9)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.  
Counting all the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of 13 3-stars.
