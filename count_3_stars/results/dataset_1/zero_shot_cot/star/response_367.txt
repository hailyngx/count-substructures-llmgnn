Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The possible 3-stars in this graph can be formed with the following nodes as the center node: 0, 1, 2, 8. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each of the potential center nodes:
- For node 0: <0, (2, 6, 8)> 
- For node 1: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- For node 8: <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
