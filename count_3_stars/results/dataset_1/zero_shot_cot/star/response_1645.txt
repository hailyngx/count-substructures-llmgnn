Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 9, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 2)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<9, (8, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars. Each unique 3-star is counted only once:
