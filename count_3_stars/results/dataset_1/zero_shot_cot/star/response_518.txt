Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

From the given edges, we can list the possible 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 8, 1)>
- <1, (6, 8, 0)>
- <2, (9, 3, 9)>
- <3, (9, 2, 9)>
- <4, (6, 6, 1)>
- <6, (1, 4, 1)>
- <7, (0, 8, 8)>
- <8, (7, 1, 0)>
- <9, (2, 3, 2)>

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
