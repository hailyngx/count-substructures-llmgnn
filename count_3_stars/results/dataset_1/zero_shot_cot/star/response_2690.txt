Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for every node that has exactly three edges connected to it. These nodes will be the center of the 3-stars.

Looking at the provided edges, we see that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8 each have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list the 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
Total 3-stars for node 0: [1]

For node 1:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
Total 3-stars for node 1: [1]

For node 3:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
Total 3-stars for node 3: [1]

For node 8:
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
Total 3-stars for node 8: [1]

Adding up the 3-stars from all the nodes, we get a total of [4].
