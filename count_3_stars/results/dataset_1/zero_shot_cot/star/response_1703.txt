Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars from the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 9, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 7, 8)>
7. <6, (2, 7, 9)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
9. <8, (2, 5, 7)>
10. <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
