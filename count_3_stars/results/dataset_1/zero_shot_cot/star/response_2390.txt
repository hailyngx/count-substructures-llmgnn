Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with three edges (leaves) connected to it.  
    Node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5)  
    Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8)  
    Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 9)  
    Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8)  
    Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 7)  
    Node 5 has 2 edges: (5, 0), (5, 8)  
    Node 6 has 4 edges: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)  
    Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6)  
    Node 8 has 5 edges: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)  
    Node 9 has 2 edges: (9, 2), (9, 6)  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
    Since a 3-star has a center node and three leaves, we need to count the number of unique combinations of center node and leaves that form a 3-star.  

Step 3: Count the 3-stars for each center node.
    For each center node:
    - Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 5) -> <0, (2, 4, 5)>
    - Node 1: (1, 3, 4, 6), (1, 4, 6, 8) -> <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>
    - Node 2: (2, 0, 7, 9) -> <2, (0, 7, 9)>
    - Node 3: (3, 1, 7, 8) -> <3, (1, 7, 8)>
    - Node 4: (4, 0, 1, 7) -> <4, (0, 1, 7)>
    - Node 6: (6, 1, 7, 8), (6, 7, 8, 9) -> <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
    - Node 7: (7, 2, 3, 6), (7, 3, 4, 6), (7, 4, 6, 8) -> <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
    - Node 8: (8, 1, 3, 4), (8, 1, 4, 6), (8, 1, 6, 8), (8, 4, 5, 6) -> <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>
    - Node 9: (9, 2, 6, 7) -> <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Step 4: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
    Summing up the unique 3-stars found:
    [9]
