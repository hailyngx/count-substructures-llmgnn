Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

First, let's list all the nodes that have exactly three connections:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.

Next, we construct the 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
- <1, (7, 7, 4)>
- <2, (6, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 7, 7)>
- <6, (2, 8, 8)>
- <7, (1, 4, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
