Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

First, let's list all the possible 3-stars based on the given edges:
<0, (3, 1, 4)>
<1, (3, 0, -)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)> <3, (1, 0, 4)> <3, (4, 0, 7)> <3, (9, -, -)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)> <4, (3, 2, 7)> <4, (7, 2, 8)>
<6, (8, -, -)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 6)>
<9, (3, -, -)>

Now, we count the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 1, 4)>
<1, (3, 0, -)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)> 
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (8, -, -)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 6)>
<9, (3, -, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
