Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a 3-star. 

We can observe that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4 have 4 edges connected to them, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 2: (2, 7, 9)
2. Node 5: (5, 4, 6)
3. Node 6: (6, 1, 9)
4. Node 7: (7, 1, 5)
5. Node 8: (8, 3, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<2, (7, 9, -)>
<5, (4, 6, -)>
<6, (1, 9, -)>
<7, (1, 5, -)>
<8, (3, 6, -)>
