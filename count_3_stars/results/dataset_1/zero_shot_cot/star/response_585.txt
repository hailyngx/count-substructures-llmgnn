Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with 3 connections: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1: (0, 1, 7), (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 8), (1, 4, 9), (1, 8, 9)
- For node 2: (1, 2, 4), (2, 4, 7)
- For node 3: (3, 4, 8), (3, 4, 9), (3, 8, 9)
- For node 4: (1, 2, 4), (3, 4, 8), (3, 4, 9), (4, 7, 8), (4, 7, 9), (4, 8, 9)
- For node 8: (1, 4, 8), (3, 4, 8), (8, 9, 1), (8, 9, 3)
- For node 9: (1, 4, 9), (3, 4, 9), (8, 9, 1), (8, 9, 3)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 0)>
<1, (0, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 1)>
<1, (4, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 9, 1)>
<2, (1, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 9, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<4, (7, 9, 4)>
<4, (8, 9, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (8, 1, 9)>
<9, (8, 3, 9)>
