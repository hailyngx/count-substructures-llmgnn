Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided edges, we can see that the nodes with the following degrees are potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 8
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 5
- Node 9 has degree 5

Therefore, the potential central nodes for 3-stars are nodes 1, 5, and 6. Let's now identify the 3-stars centered at these nodes.

At node 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>

At node 5:
- <5, (2, 8, 9)>

At node 6:
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
