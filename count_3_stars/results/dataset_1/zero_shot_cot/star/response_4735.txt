Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0:
    <0, (2, 5, 7)>

2. Node 1:
    No 3-star as the node 1 is not connected to exactly three nodes.

3. Node 2:
    <2, (0, 3, 4)>

4. Node 3:
    No 3-star as the node 3 is not connected to exactly three nodes.

5. Node 4:
    No 3-star as the node 4 is not connected to exactly three nodes.

6. Node 5:
    <5, (0, 4, 9)>

7. Node 6:
    No 3-star as the node 6 is not connected to exactly three nodes.

8. Node 7:
    No 3-star as the node 7 is not connected to exactly three nodes.

9. Node 8:
    No 3-star as the node 8 is not connected to exactly three nodes.

10. Node 9:
    <9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, and <5, (0, 4, 9)>.
