Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's identify and count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. 3-star with node 0 as the center: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3) [<0, (1, 2, 3)>]
2. 3-star with node 1 as the center: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 7), (1, 0, 8), (1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 5) [<1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>]
3. 3-star with node 2 as the center: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 5) [<2, (0, 1, 5)>]
4. 3-star with node 3 as the center: (3, 0, 7) [<3, (0, 7, 1)>]
5. 3-star with node 4 as the center: (4, 8, 9) [<4, (8, 9, 7)>]
6. 3-star with node 5 as the center: (5, 1, 2), (5, 1, 6), (5, 1, 8), (5, 2, 0), (5, 2, 1), (5, 2, 6), (5, 2, 8), (5, 6, 1), (5, 6, 2), (5, 6, 8), (5, 8, 1), (5, 8, 2) [<5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>]
7. 3-star with node 6 as the center: (6, 1, 5) [<6, (1, 5, 2)>]
8. 3-star with node 7 as the center: (7, 1, 3), (7, 1, 9) [<7, (1, 3, 0)>]
9. 3-star with node 8 as the center: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 5), (8, 4, 9) [<8, (1, 4, 5)>]
10. 3-star with node 9 as the center: (9, 4, 7) [<9, (4, 7, 8)>]

Count of 3-stars: [13]
