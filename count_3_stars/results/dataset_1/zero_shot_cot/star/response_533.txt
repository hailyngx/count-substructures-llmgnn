Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify all the 3-stars present in the graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. So, we need to find all possible combinations of center nodes and their connected leaves.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 2)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 1, 4)>
<8, (6, 7, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph inside brackets [].
