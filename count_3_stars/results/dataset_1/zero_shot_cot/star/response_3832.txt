Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
From the list of edges given, we can identify the following nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 3 has edges (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7)
- Node 4 has edges (4, 3), (4, 7)
- Node 5 has edges (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9)
- Node 9 has edges (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for combinations of edges that form a 3-star structure around a central node. Let's list them out.

<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (5, 7, 1)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
From the list above, we can see that there are 5 unique 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
