Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are potential central nodes for a 3-star.

The nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 8), (2, 0), (8, 0) [Degree: 4]
- Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 1), (7, 1) [Degree: 4]
- Node 2: (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 9), (8, 2), (9, 2) [Degree: 8]
- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (6, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3) [Degree: 6]
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (5, 4), (7, 4) [Degree: 4]
- Node 5: (4, 5), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 5) [Degree: 4]
- Node 6: (3, 6), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6) [Degree: 6]
- Node 7: (1, 7), (4, 7), (6, 7), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (9, 7) [Degree: 8]
- Node 8: (0, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 3) [Degree: 6]
- Node 9: (2, 9), (3, 9), (7, 9), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7) [Degree: 6]

Based on the degrees of the nodes, nodes 2, 7, and 8 are central nodes as they each have exactly 3 neighbors.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars centered at nodes 2, 7, and 8.

For node 2, the 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 7, the 3-stars are:
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 8, the 3-star is:
- <8, (0, 3, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.  
So, the final answer is [5].
