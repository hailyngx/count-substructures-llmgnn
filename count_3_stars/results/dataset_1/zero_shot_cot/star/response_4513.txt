Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of possible 3-stars in the graph, which are nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. We have two central nodes in this graph: node 0 and node 1. 

For node 0:
- (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 6)

For node 1:
- (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 9)

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0, we have one 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- For node 1, we have one 3-star: <1, (0, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 6)> and <1, (0, 8, 9)>.
