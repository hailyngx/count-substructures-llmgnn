Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0  
   Leaves: 3, 4
   
2. Central node: 1  
   Leaves: 3, 4
   
3. Central node: 2  
   Leaves: 3, 4, 5
   
4. Central node: 3  
   Leaves: 0, 1, 2
   
5. Central node: 4  
   Leaves: 0, 1, 2
   
6. Central node: 5  
   Leaves: 2, 6
   
7. Central node: 6  
   Leaves: 2, 4, 5
   
8. Central node: 7  
   Leaves: 5, 6
   
9. Central node: 8  
   Leaves: 5, 6, 7
   
10. Central node: 9  
    Leaves: 3, 4, 6, 7

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 6, 7)>
