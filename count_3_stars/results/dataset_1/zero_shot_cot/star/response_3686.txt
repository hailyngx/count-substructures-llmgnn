Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the list of nodes and their neighbors to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 1) (1, 0) - No 3-stars
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 5), (5, 1) - <1, (0, 5)>
3. Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 8), (6, 2), (8, 2) - <2, (6, 8)>
4. Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 9), (6, 3), (9, 3) - No 3-stars
5. Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (6, 4), (7, 4), (9, 4) - <4, (6, 7, 9)>
6. Node 5: (5, 1), (1, 5) - No 3-stars
7. Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (8, 6) - <6, (2, 3, 4, 8)>
8. Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 9), (4, 7), (9, 7) - No 3-stars
9. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 9), (2, 8), (6, 8), (9, 8) - <8, (2, 6, 9)>
10. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9) - <9, (3, 4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 5)>, <2, (6, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
