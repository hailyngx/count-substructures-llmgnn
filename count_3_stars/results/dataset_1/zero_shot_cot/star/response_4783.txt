Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are nodes with exactly three incident edges. 

From the given graph:
- Node 0 has 3 incident edges
- Node 3 has 4 incident edges
- Node 6 has 4 incident edges
- Node 8 has 3 incident edges

So, the central nodes are 0, 3, 6, and 8.

Next, we will look at each central node and find the 3-stars connected to them:

For central node 0:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>

For central node 3:
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>

For central node 6:
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 0, 4)>

For central node 8:
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>>]
