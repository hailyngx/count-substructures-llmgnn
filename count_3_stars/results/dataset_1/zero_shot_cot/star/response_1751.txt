Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that have exactly three edges. These nodes will act as the center nodes of the potential 3-stars. 

The nodes with three edges are: 
- Node 0 (connected to 2, 6, 7)
- Node 2 (connected to 0, 1, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to 6, 8, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to 0, 3, 4, 5)

Now, let's check the neighbors of these center nodes to see if they form 3-stars. 

For Node 0:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
  
For Node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>

For Node 5:
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
  
For Node 6:
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (0, 5, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>.
