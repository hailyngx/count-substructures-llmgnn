Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the two latter nodes are not directly connected to each other. These sets represent the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (7, 8)>
<1, (4, 8)>
<2, (3, 7)>
<3, (2, 5)>
<4, (1, 6)>
<5, (3)>
<6, (4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
