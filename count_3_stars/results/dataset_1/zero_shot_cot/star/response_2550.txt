Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 9, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
