Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes that can act as centers for 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with at least three edges connected to them.

By examining the edges provided, we can identify the following nodes with at least three edges connected to them:
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8)

Now, we can construct the 3-stars using these center nodes:
1. Node 2 as the center:
     <2, (3, 7, 8)>
2. Node 7 as the center:
     <7, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 7, 8)> and <7, (2, 5, 8)>.
