Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, we identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

Letâ€™s list the 3-stars we have found:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 9, _)>
<5, (7, _, _)>
<6, (1, 2, _)>
<7, (5, _, _)>
<8, (3, _, _)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph:

[9]
