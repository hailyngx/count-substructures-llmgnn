Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
