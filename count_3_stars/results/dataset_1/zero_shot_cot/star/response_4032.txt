Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance of a 3-star. 

Looking at the given edges, let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>  
2. <2, (0, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
5. <5, (2, 4, 8)>
6. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <8, (2, 4, 5)>
8. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
