Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. This creates the 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (3, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. This creates the 3-star:
   - <1, (5, 8, 0)>

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 9. This creates the 3-star:
   - <4, (6, 9, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
