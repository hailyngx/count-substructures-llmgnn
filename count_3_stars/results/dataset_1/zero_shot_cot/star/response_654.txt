Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
   <0, (2, 4, 7)>
   <0, (2, 4, 8)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
   <2, (0, 3, 4)>
   <2, (0, 4, 7)>
   <2, (0, 4, 9)>
   <2, (3, 4, 9)>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
   <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   <3, (2, 4, 8)>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
   <4, (0, 2, 9)>
   <4, (0, 3, 9)>
   <4, (2, 3, 9)>

5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
   <8, (0, 3, 5)>
   <8, (0, 3, 9)>

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
   <9, (2, 4, 6)>
   <9, (2, 4, 8)>

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
