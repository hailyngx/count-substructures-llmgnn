Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in a 3-star pattern. Since each 3-star has exactly one center node and three leaf nodes, we need to look for nodes with exactly three neighbors.

In this case, node 2, node 3, node 4, and node 5 have exactly three neighbors each. So, these nodes can potentially be the center nodes of 3-stars.

Next, we need to check if the neighbors of each potential center node form 3-stars. We will list them in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

1. Potential 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
2. Potential 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
3. Potential 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 5, 8)>
4. Potential 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
