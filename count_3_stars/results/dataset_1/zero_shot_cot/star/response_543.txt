Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For Node 0:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
Total: 2

2. For Node 1:
<1, (0, 9, 7)>
Total: 1

3. For Node 2:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
Total: 1

4. For Node 3:
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
Total: 1

5. For Node 4:
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
Total: 1

6. For Node 5:
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
Total: 1

7. For Node 6:
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
Total: 1

8. For Node 7:
<7, (0, 6, 9)>
Total: 1

9. For Node 8:
<8, (4, 9, 6)>
Total: 1

10. For Node 9:
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
Total: 1

Count of 3-stars: [11]
