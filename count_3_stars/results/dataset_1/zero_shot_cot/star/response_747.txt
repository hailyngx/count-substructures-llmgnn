Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 7)>
<3, (1, 9, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
