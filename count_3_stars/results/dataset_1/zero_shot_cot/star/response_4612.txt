Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Examining the edges, we find the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 7, -)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph.  
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
