Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming 3-star patterns).

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
