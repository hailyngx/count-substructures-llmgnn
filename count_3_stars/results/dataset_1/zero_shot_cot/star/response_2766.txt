Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be our three-star centers. 
Based on the given edges, we have the following nodes with their respective degrees: 

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 5

The nodes with degree 3 are node 5 and node 9. These will be our potential three-star centers. 

Next, let's list all the possible 3-stars in this graph:

1. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
2. <5, (0, 1, 9)>
3. <5, (1, 0, 6)>
4. <5, (1, 0, 9)>
5. <5, (6, 0, 1)>
6. <5, (6, 0, 9)>
7. <5, (9, 0, 1)>
8. <5, (9, 1, 0)>
9. <9, (0, 1, 4)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 8)>
11. <9, (0, 4, 1)>
12. <9, (0, 4, 8)>
13. <9, (1, 0, 4)>
14. <9, (1, 0, 8)>
15. <9, (1, 4, 0)>
16. <9, (1, 4, 8)>
17. <9, (4, 0, 1)>
18. <9, (4, 1, 0)>
19. <9, (4, 1, 8)>
20. <9, (4, 0, 8)>
21. <9, (8, 0, 1)>
22. <9, (8, 1, 0)>
23. <9, (8, 1, 4)>
24. <9, (8, 0, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [24].
