Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.

2. Form the 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
   - <0, (2, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (5, 8)>
   - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <8, (1, 7, 9)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
