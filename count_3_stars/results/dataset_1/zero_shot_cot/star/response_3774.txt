Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first list all the nodes in the graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: {(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 8)} -> <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. Node 1: {(1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8)} -> <1, (0, 7, 8)>
3. Node 3: {(3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 9)} -> <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>
4. Node 4: {(4, 2), (4, 3)} -> No 3-star
5. Node 5: {(5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9)} -> <5, (3, 8, 9)>
6. Node 7: {(7, 1), (7, 2)} -> No 3-star
7. Node 8: {(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5)} -> <8, (0, 1, 5)>
8. Node 9: {(9, 3), (9, 5)} -> No 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>.
