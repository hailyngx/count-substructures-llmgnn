Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 has neighbors 3 and 9 - (0, 3, 9)
2. Node 1 has neighbors 5, 6, and 9 - (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 9), (1, 6, 9)
3. Node 3 has only one neighbor 0, so it cannot form a 3-star.
4. Node 4 has neighbors 6 and 9 - (4, 6, 9)
5. Node 5 has neighbors 1, 7, and 9 - (5, 1, 7), (5, 1, 9), (5, 7, 9)
6. Node 6 has neighbors 1, 4, and 7 - (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 7), (6, 4, 7)
7. Node 7 has neighbors 5, 6, and 9 - (7, 5, 6), (7, 5, 9), (7, 6, 9)
8. Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, 5, and 7 - (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 4), (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 7), (9, 1, 4), (9, 1, 5), (9, 1, 7), (9, 4, 5), (9, 4, 7), (9, 5, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 9)>
<6, (1, 7)>
<6, (4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
