Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from each node, identify the neighbors of the node.
2. Check if the neighbors form a 3-star with the node as the center.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, -)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
