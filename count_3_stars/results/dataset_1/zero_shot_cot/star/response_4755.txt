Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

We will list down all possible 3-stars using each node as the central node:
- <0, (5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 3)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars to get the final answer:
[9]
