Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9.
2. We will iterate through each node to check if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes.
3. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to it.

Let's start calculating:

- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two edges: (0, 6) and (0, 9).
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two edges: (1, 7) and (1, 8).
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two edges: (2, 3) and (2, 7).
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 8)>.
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two edges: (4, 5) and (4, 9).
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (4, 6, 7)>.
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 5)> and <6, (5, 7, 9)>.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 5)>.
- Node 8 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two edges: (8, 1) and (8, 3).
- Node 9 is not part of any 3-star because it has only two edges: (9, 0) and (9, 4).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

<3, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>.
