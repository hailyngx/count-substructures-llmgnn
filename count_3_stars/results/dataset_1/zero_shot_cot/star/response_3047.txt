Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in the 3-stars. From the given edges, we can see that node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7. But for a 3-star, the center node should only have three edges, so we can exclude node 7. 

So, the possible 3-stars in this graph with node 2 as the center node are:
- <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <2, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>

Now, we can count how many of these 3-stars are present in the graph:
