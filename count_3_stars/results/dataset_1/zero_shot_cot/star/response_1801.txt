Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 8, 3)>
<1, (7, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 0)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
