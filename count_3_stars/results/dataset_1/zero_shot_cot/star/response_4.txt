Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 9, 2)>
3. <2, (3, 9, 1)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 9)>
6. <5, (6, 7, _)>
7. <6, (0, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (0, 6, 3)>
9. <8, (6, _, _)>
10.<9, (1, 2, 4)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
