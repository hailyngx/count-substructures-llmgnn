Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-star configurations. In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

1. <0, (5, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (6, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 9, 1)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 2)>
5. <4, (6, 8, 9)>
6. <5, (2, 3, 6)>
7. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
8. <7, (0, 5, 9)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The final answer is [10].
