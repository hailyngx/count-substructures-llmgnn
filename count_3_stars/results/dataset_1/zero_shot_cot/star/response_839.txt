Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6. It forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6. (0, 1, 4, 6)
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7. (1, 0, 5, 7)
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 8. (2, 0, 3, 8)

Therefore, the count of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>.
