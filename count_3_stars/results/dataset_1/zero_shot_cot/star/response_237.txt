Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, to count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we look at the number of unique 3-stars we found. As there are 8 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [8].
