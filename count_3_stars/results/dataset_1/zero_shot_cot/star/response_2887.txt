Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 8), (8, 1), (8, 0) - <0, (8, 1, 0)>
2. Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 8), (7, 1) - <1, (7, 8, 1)>
3. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 3) - <3, (4, 9, 3)>
4. Node 4: (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2) - <4, (2, 3, 4)>
5. Node 6: (6, 9), (9, 3), (9, 6) - <6, (9, 3, 6)>
6. Node 7: (1, 7), (7, 1), (1, 8) - <7, (1, 8, 7)>
7. Node 8: (0, 8), (1, 8), (8, 0) - <8, (0, 1, 8)>
8. Node 9: (3, 9), (4, 9), (9, 3) - <9, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
