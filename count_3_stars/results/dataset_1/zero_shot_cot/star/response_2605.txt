Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the 3-stars. We can see that the node degrees are as follows: 
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2

Since a 3-star graph has exactly 4 nodes where one has degree 3 and the other three have degree 1, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- 3-star 1: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- 3-star 2: <4, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (4, 7, 8)> and <4, (2, 5, 7)>.
