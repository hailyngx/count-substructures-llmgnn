Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the central node in each potential 3-star. The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's examine each node to see if they are the central node of a 3-star:
- Node 0 is not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 1 is not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 2 can form a 3-star <2, (0, 8, 9)>.
- Node 3 is not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 4 is not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 5 is not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 6 can form a 3-star <6, (1, 3, 4)>.
- Node 7 is not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 8 is not a central node of a 3-star.
- Node 9 is not a central node of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 8, 9)> and <6, (1, 3, 4)>.
