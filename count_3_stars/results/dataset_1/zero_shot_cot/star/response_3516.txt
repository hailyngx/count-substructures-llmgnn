Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to determine if there are any 3-star configurations centered at node 0. 
- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- There is a 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (6, -, -)>.

Next, let's analyze the remaining nodes and their connections to see if there are any more 3-stars in the graph. 

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to node 1.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.

Based on the connections, we have the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (6, -, -)>
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
