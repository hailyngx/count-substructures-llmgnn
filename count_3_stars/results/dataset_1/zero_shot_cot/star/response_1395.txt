Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

The possible 3-stars can be formed using the following central nodes: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 as they have exactly 3 adjacent nodes each. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (5, 7, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 9, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 4)>
<9, (8, 6, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
