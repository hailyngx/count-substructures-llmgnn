Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
