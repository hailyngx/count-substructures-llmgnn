Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [4].
