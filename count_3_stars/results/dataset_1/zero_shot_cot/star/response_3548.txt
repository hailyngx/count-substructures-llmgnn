Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star has exactly 4 nodes (1 central node and 3 leaf nodes), we need to find all nodes with exactly 3 incident edges in the graph. 

From the given edges, the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges are:  
Node 7 (connected to 0, 1, 4)  
Node 8 (connected to 0, 1, 5)   
Node 9 (connected to 3, 4, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

<7, (0, 1, 4)>  
<8, (0, 1, 5)>  
<9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
