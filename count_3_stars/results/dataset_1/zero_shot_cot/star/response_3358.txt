Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [14].
