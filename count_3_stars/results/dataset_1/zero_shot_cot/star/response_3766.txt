Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 1

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [6]

​<1, (4, 7, 9)> <3, (0, 4, 5)> <4, (1, 3, 5)> <5, (2, 3, 4)> <7, (1, 2, 8)> <8, (3, 4, 7)>​
