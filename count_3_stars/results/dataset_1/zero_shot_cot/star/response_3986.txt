Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Since the graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges, there are multiple potential 3-stars that we need to examine. 

Let's list all the potential 3-stars (represented as <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>):

1. <0, (4, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 3, _)> (Only two leaves attached to node 1. The 3-star is incomplete)
3. <2, (1, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 2, _)> (Only two leaves attached to node 4. The 3-star is incomplete)
6. <5, (0, 9, _)> (Only two leaves attached to node 5. The 3-star is incomplete)
7. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (3, 6, _)>
9. <8, (0, 2, _)>
10. <9, (5, _, _)>

Therefore, the number of complete 3-stars in this graph is [5]. 

The 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (3, 6, _)>
