Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at each node:
- Node 0: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 5)> is a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 4, and 5 as leaves.
- Node 2: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 3: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 4: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 5: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 6: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 7: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 8: Not part of any 3-stars.
- Node 9: Not part of any 3-stars.

So, there is 1 unique 3-star in the given graph: <1, (2, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
