Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (7, 2, 5)>  
<1, (5, 8, 2)>  
<2, (7, 8, 9)>  
<3, (6, 8, 7)>
