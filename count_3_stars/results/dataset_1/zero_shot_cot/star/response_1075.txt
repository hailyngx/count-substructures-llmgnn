Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

After analyzing the given edges, we can see that the 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
