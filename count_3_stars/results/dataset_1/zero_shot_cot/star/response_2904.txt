Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
We will identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

[There are 29 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
