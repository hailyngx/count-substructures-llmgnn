Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - There are 4 unique 3-stars based on the analysis above.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   - <2, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 6)>

4. Output the final answer inside brackets:
   - [4]
