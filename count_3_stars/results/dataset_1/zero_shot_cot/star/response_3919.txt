Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are [9] such structures in the graph.
