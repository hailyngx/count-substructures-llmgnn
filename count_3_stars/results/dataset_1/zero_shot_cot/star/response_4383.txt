Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
