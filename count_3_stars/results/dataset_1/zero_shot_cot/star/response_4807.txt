Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 6), <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (9, 6, 8)>
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 7), (1, 5, 6), <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 1, 7)>, <1, (5, 1, 6)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 7), <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 3)>
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 7), <3, (1, 7, 2)>
5. Node 5: (5, 1, 6)
6. Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 5, 1), (6, 8, 0), (6, 9, 0), <6, (0, 8, 1)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (5, 1, 6)>, <6, (8, 6, 9)>, <6, (9, 6, 8)>
7. Node 7: (7, 1, 3), (7, 1, 2), (7, 2, 3), <7, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 1, 7)>, <7, (3, 7, 1)>
8. Node 8: (8, 0, 6), <8, (0, 6, 9)>
9. Node 9: (9, 0, 6)

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 1, 7)>, <1, (5, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 3)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (0, 8, 1)>, <6, (1, 5, 6)>, <6, (5, 1, 6)>, <6, (8, 6, 9)>, <6, (9, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 1, 7)>, <7, (3, 7, 1)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
