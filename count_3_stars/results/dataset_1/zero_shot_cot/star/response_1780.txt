Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8) -> <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3) -> <2, (0, 1, 3)>
3. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 9) -> <3, (2, 7, 9)>
4. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 6) -> <8, (0, 2, 6)>
5. Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3) -> <9, (2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]  
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 3)>
