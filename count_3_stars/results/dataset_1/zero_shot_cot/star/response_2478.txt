Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8. Therefore, <4, (6, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.

2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. Therefore, <5, (1, 6, 7)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. Therefore, <6, (0, 2, 5)> is a 3-star.

4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9. Therefore, <7, (4, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.

5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6. Therefore, <8, (2, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, <9, (4, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6]. 
So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)> [6].
