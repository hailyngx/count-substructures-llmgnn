Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Since it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes, it forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9. Since it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes, it forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 9)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Since it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes, it forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 5, 9)>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9. Since it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes, it forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9. Since it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes, it forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 7, 9)>.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 6. Since it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes, it forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 4, 6)>.
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6. Since it has exactly 3 adjacent nodes, it forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
