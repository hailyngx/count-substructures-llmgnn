Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first find all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

1. (0, 3, 6)
2. (0, 3, 9)
3. (3, 4, 6)
4. (3, 4, 8)
5. (4, 6, 8)
6. (0, 6, 9)
7. (7, 8, 9)
8. (3, 6, 9)
9. (4, 6, 9)
10. (8, 9, 4)
11. (9, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 6>
<0, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 6>
<3, 4, 8>
<4, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<7, 8, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<8, 9, 4>
<9, 7, 8>
