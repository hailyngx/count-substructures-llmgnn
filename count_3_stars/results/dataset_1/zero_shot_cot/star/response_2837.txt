Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are potential central nodes for 3-stars. Let's list the potential central nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, 9

Now, let's count the 3-stars by considering each potential central node:
- For Node 1:
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>
  
- For Node 3:
  - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
  
- For Node 4:
  - <4, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 7, 9)>
  
- For Node 5:
  - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
  - <5, (6, 3, 4)>
  - <5, (2, 4, 6)>
  
- For Node 7:
  - <7, (1, 4, 8)>
  - <7, (1, 4, 9)>
  
Count of 3-stars: [7]  
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
