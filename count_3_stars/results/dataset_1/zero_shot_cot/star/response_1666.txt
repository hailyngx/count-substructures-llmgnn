Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (0):
- (0, 2)
- (0, 4)
- (0, 6)

<0, (2, 4, 6)>

2. Repeat the same process for other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
- 2 unique 3-stars
