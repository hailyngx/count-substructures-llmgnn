Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. These are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can find the following central nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 10.

Now, let's form the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (5, 6, 2)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (7, 8, 0)>
- <7, (3, 6, 5)>
- <8, (1, 5, 10)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
