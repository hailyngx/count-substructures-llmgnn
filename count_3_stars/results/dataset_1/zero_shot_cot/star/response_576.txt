Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the answer is [5].
