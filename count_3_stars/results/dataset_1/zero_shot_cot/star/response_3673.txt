Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (7, 8, X)> (This one is missing one leaf node. Let's find it.)

From the given edges, I can deduce that the missing leaf node for the 3-star around node 2 is 6. 

Thus, the complete list of unique 3-stars in this graph is:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (7, 8, 6)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
