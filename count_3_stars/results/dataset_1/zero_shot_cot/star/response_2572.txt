Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, as it will be the center of the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars by considering node 0 as the central node:

1. Node 0 with nodes 2 and 9:
<0, (2, 9)>

Therefore, there is 1 unique 3-star in the given graph.
