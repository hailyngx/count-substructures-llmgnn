Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in the given graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 0:
    <0, (3, 8, 9)>
    
2. For node 1:
    <1, (3, 7, 4)>
    
3. For node 2:
    <2, (5, 3, 6)>
    
4. For node 3:
    <3, (0, 1, 8)>
    <3, (1, 7, 4)>
    <3, (5, 2, 6)>
    
5. For node 4:
    <4, (3, 7, 6)>
    
6. For node 5:
    <5, (2, 3, 6)>
    
7. For node 6:
    <6, (5, 2, 7)>
    
8. For node 7:
    <7, (1, 4, 6)>
    
9. For node 8:
    <8, (0, 3, 6)>
    
10. For node 9:
    <9, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
