Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 6), (0, 6, 8) 
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 6), (1, 6, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 4, 7)
4. Node 4: (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 8), (4, 2, 5), (4, 2, 8), (4, 5, 8)
5. Node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 7), (6, 0, 8), (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 8), (6, 7, 8)
6. Node 7: (7, 2, 6), (7, 2, 8), (7, 6, 8), (7, 6, 9)
7. Node 8: (8, 0, 4), (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 6), (8, 0, 7), (8, 4, 5), (8, 4, 6), (8, 4, 7), (8, 5, 6), (8, 5, 7)
8. Node 9: (9, 1, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].  

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>
