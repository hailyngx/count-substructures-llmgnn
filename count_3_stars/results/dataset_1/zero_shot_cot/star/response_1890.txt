Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, -)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 8, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 9, -)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
[9]
