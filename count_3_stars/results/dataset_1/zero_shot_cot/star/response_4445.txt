Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 8, 9
   - Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 7
   - Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7
   - Node 3 has neighbors: 6, 7
   - Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 8
   - Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9
   - Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3
   - Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 5
   - Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 6

2. Check for 3-stars:
   - For each node identified above, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
