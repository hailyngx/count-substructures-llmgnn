Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 4: 7
Node 5: 6, 8
Node 6: 0, 3, 5
Node 7: 3, 4
Node 8: 0, 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 0, 3, 8

Now we can find the 3-stars based on the definition provided. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 4, 8)>
<3, (7, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

So there are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
