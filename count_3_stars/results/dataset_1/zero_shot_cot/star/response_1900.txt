Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's consider all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then, we can count how many of these combinations form a 3-star pattern.

Let's start by identifying all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, -)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, -)>
<8, (3, 5, -)>
<9, (2, 4, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
