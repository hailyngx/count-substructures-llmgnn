Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Starting from node 0:  
  - <0, (1, 6, 9)>   

2. Moving on to node 1:  
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)>  
  - <1, (5, 6, 7)>  

3. Now for node 2:
  - <2, (1, 3, 5)>  
  - <2, (4, 5, 8)>  

4. For node 3:
  - <3, (1, 2, 5)>  
  - <3, (6, 7, 8)>  

5. Node 4:
  - <4, (2, 6, 8)>  

6. Node 5:
  - <5, (1, 2, 3)>  

7. Node 6:
  - <6, (0, 1, 3)>  
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>  
  - <6, (9, 7, 8)>  

8. Node 7:
  - <7, (1, 3, 6)>  
  - <7, (6, 8, 9)>  

9. Node 8:
  - <8, (2, 4, 6)>  
  - <8, (3, 6, 7)>  
  - <8, (7, 9, 6)>  

10. Node 9:
  - <9, (0, 6, 7)>  
  - <9, (6, 8, 7)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
