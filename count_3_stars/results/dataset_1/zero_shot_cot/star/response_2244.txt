Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes and their neighbor nodes to determine the 3-stars in the graph.

The central nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 9)>]
