Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- Nodes 0, 2, 4 form a 3-star centered at node 0.
- Nodes 1, 4, 5 form a 3-star centered at node 1.
- Nodes 2, 7, 0 form a 3-star centered at node 2.
- Nodes 4, 8, 0 form a 3-star centered at node 4.
- Nodes 5, 7, 1 form a 3-star centered at node 5.
- Nodes 7, 8, 0 form a 3-star centered at node 7.
- Nodes 7, 9, 3 form a 3-star centered at node 7.
- Nodes 8, 7, 9 form a 3-star centered at node 8.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] (since there are 8 unique 3-stars). 

<0, (2, 4, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 1)>, <2, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 4)>, <5, (7, 1, 5)>, <7, (8, 0, 7)>, <7, (9, 3, 7)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>
