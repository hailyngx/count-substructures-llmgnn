Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
