Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9

2. List down all unique 3-stars in the graph:
   - <1, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <8, (5, 7, 9)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
