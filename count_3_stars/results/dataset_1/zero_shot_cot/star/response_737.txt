Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in a 3-star pattern. Since a 3-star consists of the center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

Nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:  
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 5)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 7)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 6, 9)

Now, let's construct the 3-stars by selecting these nodes as the center nodes and forming stars with their connected nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 7)>
<8, (6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 7)>, and <8, (6, 9)>.
