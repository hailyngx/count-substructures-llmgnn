Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- There are no 3-stars with node 0 as the center because it has only 2 edges (to nodes 4 and 5).
- There is 1 possible 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (3, 5, 7)>.
- There are 2 possible 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 5, 7)> and <4, (5, 7, 8)>.
- There are no 3-stars with node 5 as the center because it is connected to node 9 which is not involved in any other 3-star.
- There is 1 possible 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (4, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, and <8, (4, 5, 6)>.
