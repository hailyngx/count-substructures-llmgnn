Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
