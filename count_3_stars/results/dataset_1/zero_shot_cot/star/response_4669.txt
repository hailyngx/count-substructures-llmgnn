Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the 3-star combinations in the given graph:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (7)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 3, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Now, we need to count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. The answer is the number of unique 3-star combinations, which is 9. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
