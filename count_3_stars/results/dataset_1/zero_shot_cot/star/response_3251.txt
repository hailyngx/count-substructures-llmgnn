Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
