Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 7)  
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 5, 8)  
3. Node 4: (4, 0, 5), (4, 2, 3), (4, 3, 6), (4, 3, 7), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 7)  
4. Node 5: (5, 0, 1), (5, 0, 8), (5, 1, 8), (5, 4, 8), (5, 9, 6)  
5. Node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 4, 8), (7, 4, 9)  
6. Node 8: (8, 1, 3), (8, 1, 5), (8, 3, 7), (8, 5, 9), (8, 7, 9)  
7. Node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 6, 7)  

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:  
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 7)>, <1, (0, 5)>, <1, (5, 8)>, <4, (2, 3)>, <4, (3, 6)>, <4, (3, 7)>, <4, (5, 6)>, <4, (5, 7)>, <5, (0, 1)>, <5, (0, 8)>, <5, (4, 8)>, <5, (9, 6)>, <7, (0, 4)>, <7, (4, 8)>, <7, (4, 9)>, <8, (1, 3)>, <8, (3, 7)>, <8, (5, 9)>, <8, (7, 9)>, <9, (5, 6)>, <9, (6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
