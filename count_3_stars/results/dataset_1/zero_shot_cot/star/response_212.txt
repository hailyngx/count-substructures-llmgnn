Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes.
From the given list of edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 7, 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Step 2: Find the 3-stars.
For each central node, we need to find the 3-stars by identifying the connected nodes for each central node.

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <0, (2, 7, 9)>

For Node 2:
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
  
For Node 9:
- <9, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
There are a total of 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Output: [15]
