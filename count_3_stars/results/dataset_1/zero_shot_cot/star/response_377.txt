Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes. In this case, the central node will be the node with degree 3, as it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's list all 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
