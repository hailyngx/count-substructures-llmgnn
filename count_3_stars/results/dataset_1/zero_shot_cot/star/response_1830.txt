Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-star 1: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- 3-star 2: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- 3-star 3: <1, (6, 2, 4)>
- 3-star 4: <1, (6, 3, 9)>
- 3-star 5: <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- 3-star 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- 3-star 7: <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- 3-star 8: <6, (2, 3, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
