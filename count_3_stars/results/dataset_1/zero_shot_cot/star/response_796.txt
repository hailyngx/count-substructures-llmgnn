Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-star graphs:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 3, 8
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 5, 7
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 4, 7
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 3, 9

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
