Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph by considering each of these nodes as the center.

For node 0:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 0, 5)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>
<0, (7, 5, 8)>

For node 2:
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 3)>
<2, (4, 2, 6)>
<2, (6, 0, 2)>

For node 4:
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 4)>
<4, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (7, 0, 4)>

For node 5:
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (7, 0, 5)>
<5, (7, 4, 5)>
<5, (7, 5, 8)>

For node 6:
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 7:
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 0, 7)>
<7, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 0, 7)>
<7, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (8, 0, 7)>
<7, (8, 5, 7)>
<7, (9, 0, 7)>

For node 8:
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (3, 8, 5)>
<8, (5, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (7, 0, 8)>
<8, (7, 5, 8)>

There are [22] 3-stars in the given graph.
