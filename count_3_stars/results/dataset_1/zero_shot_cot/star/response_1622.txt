Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the unique 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.
