Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are involved in the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Next, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Node 4 is the center, connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5:
<4, (0, 3, 5)>

2. Node 6 is the center, connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5:
<6, (1, 3, 5)>

3. Node 5 is the center, connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7:
<5, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<4, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>
