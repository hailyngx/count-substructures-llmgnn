Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique configurations where a node acts as the center connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (2)>
<4, (8)>
<5, (7)>
<6, (2)>
<8, (4)>
<9, (0, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [8].
