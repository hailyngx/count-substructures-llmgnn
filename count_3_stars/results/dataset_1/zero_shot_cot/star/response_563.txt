Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 5), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 3), (2, 0, 4)
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 7), (3, 2, 8)
5. Node 5: (5, 1, 7), (5, 1, 6)
6. Node 6: (6, 0, 5), (6, 0, 7), (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 7)
7. Node 7: (7, 3, 5), (7, 3, 6)
8. Node 8: (8, 1, 3)
9. Node 9: (9, 0, 1)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 9)>
