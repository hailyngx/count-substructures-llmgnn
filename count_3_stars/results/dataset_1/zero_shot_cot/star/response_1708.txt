Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
