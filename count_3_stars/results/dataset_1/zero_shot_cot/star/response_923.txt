Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {2, 6}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: There are 3 possible 3-stars <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 1, 2)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>
- Node 1: There are 0 possible 3-stars
- Node 2: There are 0 possible 3-stars
- Node 3: There are 0 possible 3-stars
- Node 4: There are 0 possible 3-stars
- Node 5: There is 1 possible 3-star <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6: There are 0 possible 3-stars
- Node 7: There are 0 possible 3-stars
- Node 8: There are 0 possible 3-stars
- Node 9: There are 0 possible 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4, and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (4, 1, 2)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>.

So, the final answer is [4].
