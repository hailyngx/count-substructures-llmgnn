Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph by identifying the central node and its connected leaves.

First, let's list the nodes for each edge to make it easier to analyze:  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 3
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph by identifying the central node and its connected leaves:
- From the connections:
  - Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 8, and 9
  - Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, and 9

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (4, 8, 9)> and <3, (2, 5, 9)>.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
