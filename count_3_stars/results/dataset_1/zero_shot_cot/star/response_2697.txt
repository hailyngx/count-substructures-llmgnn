Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Nodes 2, 3, 5: <2, (3, 5, 7)>
2. Nodes 7, 1, 9: <7, (1, 9, 4)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 2]
