Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The total number of 3-stars in the graph will be equal to the total number of nodes.

2. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to check each node to see if it has three neighbors.

3. Let's go through each node in the graph:
    - Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
    - Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
    - Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
    - Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
    - Node 4 has 5 neighbors.
    - Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
    - Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
    - Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
    - Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

4. We can see that only Node 9 has exactly three neighbors (0, 8, and 4), forming a 3-star with Node 9 as the central node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is: <9, (0, 8, 4)>.
