Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-star configurations. We are looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Nodes with three edges: 
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 5, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 6, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 6)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 2, 4)

Now, we can list the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
