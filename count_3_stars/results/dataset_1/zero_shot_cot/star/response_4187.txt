Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes with their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to 2, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 5 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to 5 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to 7.
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to 1, 3.
- Node 7 is connected to 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 0 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We will list them as well.

There are 5 unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
