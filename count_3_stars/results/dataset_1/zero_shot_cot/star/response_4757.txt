Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list the unique 3-stars, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's start by identifying the central node and the leaf nodes for each 3-star in the graph:

1. (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7)
   <0, (2, 3, 4)>
   <0, (2, 3, 5)>
   <0, (2, 4, 5)>
   <0, (3, 4, 5)>
   <0, (2, 4, 7)>
   <0, (3, 5, 7)>

2. (1, 7) (1, 8)
   <1, (7, 8, 0)>
   
3. (2, 6) (2, 8) (6, 8)
   <2, (6, 8, 3)>
   <2, (6, 8, 7)>
   
4. (4, 6)
   <4, (6, 5, 9)>
   
5. (5, 6) (5, 7)
   <5, (6, 7, 0)>
   <5, (6, 7, 2)>
   <5, (6, 7, 9)>
   
6. (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9)
   <6, (4, 7, 0)>
   <6, (4, 7, 9)>
   <6, (7, 8, 2)>
   <6, (8, 9, 5)>

7. (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9)
   <7, (1, 5, 8)>
   <7, (5, 6, 0)>
   <7, (6, 9, 2)>
   <7, (6, 9, 8)>

8. (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6)
   <8, (6, 1, 9)>
   <8, (6, 2, 7)>
   
9. (9, 6) (9, 7)
   <9, (6, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
