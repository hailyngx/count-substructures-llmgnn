Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which will be our central nodes. Then we check if each of those nodes forms a 3-star structure.

Given the edges provided in the graph, we see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are 0, 1, 6, 7.

Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 5, 7), <0, (1, 5, 7)> (Forms a 3-star)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 6), <1, (0, 5, 6)> (Forms a 3-star)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 5), (6, 5, 7), <6, (1, 5, 7)> (Forms a 3-star)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 3), (7, 3, 6), <7, (0, 3, 6)> (Forms a 3-star)

So, there are 4 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. 
The answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
