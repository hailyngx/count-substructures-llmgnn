Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 0. These nodes will form 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. So, the 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
<0, (1, 3, _)>
Note: The third node in each 3-star with 0 as the center is not yet known.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 1. These nodes will form 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. So, the 3-stars with node 1 as the center are:
<1, (0, 3, _)>
<1, (5, 7, _)>
<1, (8, 9, _)>
Note: The third node in each 3-star with 1 as the center is not yet known.

Now, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 3. These nodes will form 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7. So, the 3-stars with node 3 as the center are:
<3, (0, 1, _)>
<3, (2, 5, _)>
<3, (7, _, _)>
Note: The third node in the third discovered 3-star with 3 as the center is not yet known.

There are no other nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, _)>
<1, (0, 3, _)>
<1, (5, 7, _)>
<1, (8, 9, _)>
<3, (0, 1, _)>
<3, (2, 5, _)>
