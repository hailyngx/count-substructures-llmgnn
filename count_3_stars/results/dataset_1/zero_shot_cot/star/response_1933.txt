Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's look at the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to node 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (4, 9)>
<2, (5, 3)>
<4, (1, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
