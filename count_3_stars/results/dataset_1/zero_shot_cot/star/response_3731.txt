Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We'll start by identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7)
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Next, we'll list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

Since we have listed all the unique 3-stars, the final answer is [3].
