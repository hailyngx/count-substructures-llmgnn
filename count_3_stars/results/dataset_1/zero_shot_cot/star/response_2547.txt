Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-star graphs within this graph:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 9, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [9].
