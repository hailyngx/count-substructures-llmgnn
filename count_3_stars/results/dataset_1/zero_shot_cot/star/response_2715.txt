Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
   
   1. Central node 0: Leaves 5, 6, 8
   2. Central node 1: Leaves 2, 4, 8
   3. Central node 3: Leaves 4, 6, 7
   4. Central node 4: Leaves 1, 3, 7
   5. Central node 5: Leaves 0, 8, 9
   6. Central node 6: Leaves 0, 3, 7
   7. Central node 7: Leaves 2, 3, 4
   8. Central node 8: Leaves 0, 4, 5
   
   Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
   
   <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>
