Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, x)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 9, x)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, x)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [6].
