Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central node should have exactly three edges connected. Let's list the possible central nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 edges connected (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 9)
- Node 3 has 3 edges connected (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7)
- Node 4 has 3 edges connected (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 9)

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph by looking at each central node:
- For Node 0: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- For Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- For Node 4: <4, (1, 3, 5)>
- For Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 9)>

Thus, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].
