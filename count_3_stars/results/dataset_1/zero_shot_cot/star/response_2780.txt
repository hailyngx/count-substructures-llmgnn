Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can start by looking at each node and its neighbors. If a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we have found a 3-star with that node as the center.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, -)>
<2, (3, 5, -)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, -)>
<6, (1, 9, -)>
<7, (5, -, -)>
<8, (4, -, -)>
<9, (6, -, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
