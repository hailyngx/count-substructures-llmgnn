Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the degree of each node in the graph.

- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2

Step 2: Find the 3-stars in the graph, which are centered at nodes with degree 3 or more.

From the degrees identified, nodes 0 and 7 have a degree of 4, making them potential center nodes for 3-stars.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars around each center node.

- For node 0: (0, 2, 5) and (0, 5, 8) are the two 3-stars.
- For node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 6, 8), and (7, 8, 9) are the three 3-stars.

Step 4: Final answer.

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
