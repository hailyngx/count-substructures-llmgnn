Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3). These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.
The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are: 1, 8

Now, let's enumerate the 3-stars:
- For node 1: (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 9), (1, 3, 8), (1, 5, 8), (1, 8, 9)
- For node 8: (8, 0, 7), (8, 0, 1), (8, 1, 7), (8, 7, 9), (8, 1, 9)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get: <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 5)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 1)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5].
