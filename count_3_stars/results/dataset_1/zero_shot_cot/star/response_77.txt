Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can see that the following nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's construct the 3-stars using each of these nodes as the center. 

After examining the graph, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
