Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node in each potential 3-star configuration. We will label them as follows: 

Node 0: (0, 3, 7, 8)  
Node 1: (1, 2)  
Node 2: (1, 2)  
Node 3: (0, 3, 8)  
Node 4: (4, 6, 8)  
Node 5: (5, 8)  
Node 6: (4, 6, 7, 8)  
Node 7: (0, 6, 7, 8)  
Node 8: (0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)  
Node 9: (8)  

Now we will count the number of 3-stars for each central node:  

- Node 0: 1  
- Node 1: 0  
- Node 2: 0  
- Node 3: 1  
- Node 4: 1  
- Node 5: 0  
- Node 6: 1  
- Node 7: 1  
- Node 8: 1  
- Node 9: 0  

Finally, calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:  
<0, (3, 7, 8)>  
<3, (0, 7, 8)>  
<4, (6, 8, 8)>  
<6, (4, 7, 8)>  
<7, (0, 6, 8)>  
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
