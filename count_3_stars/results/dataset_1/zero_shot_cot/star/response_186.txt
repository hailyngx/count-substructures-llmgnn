Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6)>
<8, (0, 6)>
<9, (2)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
