Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3.  
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 2, 3, 5

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, check if it forms a 3-star.  
For node 1: (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9) -> forms a 3-star with center 1  
For node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5) -> forms a 3-star with center 2  
For node 3: (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6) -> forms a 3-star with center 3  
For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) -> forms a 3-star with center 5  

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.  
<1, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>
