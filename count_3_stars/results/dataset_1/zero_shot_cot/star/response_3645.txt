Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars based on the information provided.

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for central nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to distinct nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has edges to nodes 2, 4, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 2, 4, and 8 as the leaves. <0, (2, 4, 8)>

2. Node 2 has edges to nodes 0 and 3. Since it does not have a third distinct edge, it does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 3 has edges to nodes 2 and 8. Since it does not have a third distinct edge, it does not form a 3-star.

4. Node 4 has edges to nodes 0 and 1. Since it does not have a third distinct edge, it does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 8 has edges to nodes 0, 3, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 0, 3, and 9 as the leaves. <8, (0, 3, 9)>

6. Node 1 has an edge to node 4. Since it does not have two more distinct edges, it does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 6 has an edge to node 9. Since it does not have two more distinct edges, it does not form a 3-star.

8. Node 9 has edges to nodes 6 and 8. Since it does not have a third distinct edge, it does not form a 3-star.

Combining all the identified 3-stars, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
