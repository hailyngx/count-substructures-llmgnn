Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-star configurations within the graph.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes:
- Central Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 7
- Central Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3
- Central Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 8
- Central Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 6
- Central Node 4: Connected to node 8
- Central Node 5: Connected to node 0
- Central Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 9
- Central Node 7: Connected to node 0
- Central Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 4
- Central Node 9: Connected to node 6

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3)>
- <2, (1, 8)>
- <3, (1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

In unique representation:
[<0, (5, 7)>, <1, (2, 3)>, <2, (1, 8)>, <3, (1, 6)>]
