Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Thus, <0, (7, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 7, but it doesn't have any other connections that form a 3-star.

Next, looking at node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Thus, <2, (1, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8, but it doesn't form a 3-star.

Checking node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to node 2 only.

Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Therefore, <5, (3, 9, 0)> is a 3-star.

Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to node 8 only.

Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- So, <7, (0, 1, 8)> is a 3-star.

Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Hence, <8, (0, 3, 6)> and <8, (0, 7, 9)> are 3-stars.

Finally, with node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
- Thus, <9, (0, 4, 5)> is a 3-star.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 9, 0)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, and <9, (0, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
