Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to the central node.

1. The central nodes in this graph are: 1, 2, 6
2. The adjacent nodes for each central node are:
    - Central node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    - Central node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
    - Central node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9

Now we can count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 1: 3-stars = 5 (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 9), (1, 5, 2), (1, 6, 3)
- For node 2: 3-stars = 5 (2, 1, 5), (2, 5, 1), (2, 6, 7), (2, 7, 6), (2, 8, 6)
- For node 6: 3-stars = 5 (6, 1, 2), (6, 2, 1), (6, 3, 7), (6, 7, 3), (6, 9, 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
