Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 1 is connected to Node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to Node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 0, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 6.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 3, 6, 7, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 5, 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

From the connections listed above, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
