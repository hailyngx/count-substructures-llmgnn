Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8.

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 3-stars are formed by the central node and three leaf nodes connected to it.

Thus, the 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
- <0, (6, 3, 9)>
- <3, (6, 9, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)> 
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, [6].
