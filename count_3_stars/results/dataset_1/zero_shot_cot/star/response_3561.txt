Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each other:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[<0, (6, 7, 1)>, <0, (6, 7, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 1)>, <3, (2, 6, 0)>, <3, (2, 6, 1)>, <5, (8, 6, 1)>, <5, (8, 6, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 5)>, <6, (1, 8, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 6)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 1)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 1, 5)>, <6, (8, 1, 6)>]

[<0, (6, 7, 1)>, <0, (6, 7, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 1)>, <3, (2, 6, 0)>, <3, (2, 6, 1)>, <5, (8, 6, 1)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
