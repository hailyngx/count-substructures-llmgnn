Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Given the edges provided, we can see that only nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5 have exactly three edges incident to them. These nodes act as potential centers for 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
3. <4, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
