Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges, which will form the leaves of the 3-star. Then, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9) => <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6) => <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- For node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5) => <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- For node 3: (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 9) => <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3) => <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- For node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2) => <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 4) => <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- For node 7: No 3-star as it doesn't have 3 edges connected to it.
- For node 8: No 3-star as it doesn't have 3 edges connected to it.
- For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 5) => <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]

So, the unique 3-stars in the graph are <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, and <9, (0, 3, 5)>. [8]
