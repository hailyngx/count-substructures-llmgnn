Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected exactly to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (3, 1, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 0, 6)>
3. <2, (7, 8, 9)>
4. <7, (2, 8, 9)>
5. <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
