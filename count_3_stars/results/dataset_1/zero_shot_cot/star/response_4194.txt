Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers of 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 8, 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7)

Next, let's check the neighbors of these potential centers to form 3-stars. We need to ensure that each potential center has exactly three neighbors.

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>

For Node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>

For Node 3:
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (2, 8, 7)>

For Node 4:
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- No valid 3-stars since Node 4 is connected to only 3 other nodes.

For Node 8:
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [10].  
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<0, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<2, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 8, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 7)>.
