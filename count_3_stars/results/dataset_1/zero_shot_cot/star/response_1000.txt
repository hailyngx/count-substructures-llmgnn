Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
3. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <0, (3, 6, 8)>
5. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
6. <0, (6, 8, 9)>
7. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
8. <2, (0, 7, 9)>
9. <2, (6, 7, 8)>
10. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
11. <6, (0, 4, 5)>
12. <6, (1, 3, 7)>
13. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
14. <6, (3, 4, 5)>
15. <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
