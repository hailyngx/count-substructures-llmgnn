Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Let's go step by step:

1. **Identify Central Nodes**: Nodes with exactly three edges are good candidates for being the central node of a 3-star. Let's list them:
   - Node 1 is connected to 4 different nodes (2, 6, 8, 9)
   - Node 2 is connected to 5 different nodes (1, 4, 5, 7, 9)
   - Node 8 is connected to 4 different nodes (1, 3, 7, 9)
   - Node 9 is connected to 4 different nodes (1, 2, 5, 8)

2. **Identify 3-stars**: A 3-star is formed when the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's look at the central nodes found above and identify the 3-stars:
   - Central node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
     - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
     - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
     - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
   - Central node 2 does not form any 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
   - Central node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
     - <8, (1, 3, 7)>
     - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
     - <8, (3, 7, 9)>
   - Central node 9 does not form any 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.

3. **Count the Total**: There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars identified in the given graph.

4. **Final Answer**: The final count of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
   - The unique 3-stars found are:
     - <1, (2, 6, 8)>
     - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
     - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
     - <8, (1, 3, 7)>
     - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
     - <8, (3, 7, 9)>
