Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8. This forms a 3-star centered at node 0 with leaves 1, 7, and 8. (<0, (1, 7, 8)>)

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star centered at node 1 with leaves 0, 3, and 4. (<1, (0, 3, 4)>)

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star centered at node 3 with leaves 1, 4, and 9. (<3, (1, 4, 9)>)

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. This forms a 3-star centered at node 4 with leaves 1, 2, and 3. (<4, (1, 2, 3)>)

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. This forms a 3-star centered at node 7 with leaves 0, 2, and 4. (<7, (0, 2, 4)>)

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7. This forms a 3-star centered at node 9 with leaves 3, 6, and 7. (<9, (3, 6, 7)>)

7. There are no other 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
