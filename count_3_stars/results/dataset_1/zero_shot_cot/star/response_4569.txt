Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

1. 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 5, 6)>
3. 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
