Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 4 and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 3)>
<4, (7, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 7, 7)>
<8, (7, 2, 7)>
<8, (7, 7, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find: [7]
