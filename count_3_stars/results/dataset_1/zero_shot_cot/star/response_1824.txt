Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of 3 nodes that form a 3-star structure around a central node.

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes: 1, 5, 8, 9

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their neighbors:
   - Node 5: (0, 4, 6), (3, 4, 7)
   - Node 4: (1, 5, 8), (1, 5, 9)

Now list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
