Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the shape of a star.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 8: <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 4: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 8: <8, (0, 2, 8)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which can also be counted as [5].
