Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars.

Potential central nodes: 1, 2, 9

Step 2: For each potential central node, identify the nodes that are connected to it. These will be the leaves of the 3-stars.

For node 1:
Leaves: 3, 4, 5, 8

For node 2:
Leaves: 3, 5

For node 9:
Leaves: 3, 7

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Number of 3-stars: [1]

<1, (3, 4, 5, 8)>
