Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be in the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has the center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have a degree of 3.

The nodes with a degree of 3 in this graph are: 1, 3, 7, and 8.

Next, let's consider each of these nodes as potential centers for 3-stars and check which combinations of nodes would form a 3-star with them.

For node 1:
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <1, (7, 8, 0)>

For node 3:
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (5, 4, 8)>
- <3, (8, 4, 5)>
- <3, (8, 5, 4)>

For node 7:
- <7, (1, 8, 0)>
- <7, (8, 1, 0)>

For node 8:
- <8, (3, 7, 0)>
- <8, (7, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 0)>, <8, (3, 7, 0)>.
