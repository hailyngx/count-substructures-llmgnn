Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars where one node is the center and the other three nodes are connected to this center node. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 3
- Node 5: Connected to node 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 6
- Node 8: Connected to node 3
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
For each node, check if it has exactly three connected nodes. If so, it forms a 3-star.

- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
