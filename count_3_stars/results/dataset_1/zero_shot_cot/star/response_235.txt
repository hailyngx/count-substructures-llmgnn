Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars present. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges coming out from them:
   - Node 0 has edges to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
   - Node 6 has edges to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9.
   
2. Once we identify nodes with exactly three edges, we need to check if they form a 3-star:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5. <6, (1, 3, 5)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified:
   - We found two unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)> and <6, (1, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
