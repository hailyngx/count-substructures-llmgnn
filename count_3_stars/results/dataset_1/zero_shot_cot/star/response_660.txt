Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <3, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
