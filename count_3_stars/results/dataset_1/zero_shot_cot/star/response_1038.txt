Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star centered at node 1. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star centered at node 4. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8. This forms a 3-star centered at node 5. <5, (1, 4, 8)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star centered at node 6. <6, (1, 3, 4)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star centered at node 8. <8, (2, 4, 5)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. This forms a 3-star centered at node 9. <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
