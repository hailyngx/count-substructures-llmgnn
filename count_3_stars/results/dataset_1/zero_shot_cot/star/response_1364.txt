Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 9)>
2. <1, (5, 9)>
3. <2, (5, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 9)>
5. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (4, 5)>
8. <7, (3, 8)>
9. <8, (4, 7)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph.
