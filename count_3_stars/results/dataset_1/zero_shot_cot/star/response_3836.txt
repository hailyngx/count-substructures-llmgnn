Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes in the graph: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Next, let's determine the degrees of each node:
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 1
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
