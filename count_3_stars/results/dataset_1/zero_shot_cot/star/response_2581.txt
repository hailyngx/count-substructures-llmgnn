Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can examine the neighbors of each node in the graph and identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Given information:
- 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- 20 edges: {(0, 9), (1, 5), (2, 6), (3, 9), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8)}

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: (0, 9) -> No 3-star
- Node 1: (1, 5) -> No 3-star
- Node 2: (2, 6) -> No 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 9) -> No 3-star
- Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8) -> <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9) -> <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 6) -> No 3-star
- Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9) -> No 3-star
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8) -> <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
[9]
