Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2
- The remaining nodes have degree 1

Since we are interested in 3-stars, we will only focus on the nodes with degree 3, which are nodes 0 and 2.

Now let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8) -> <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 8), (2, 9) -> <2, (0, 8, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>].
