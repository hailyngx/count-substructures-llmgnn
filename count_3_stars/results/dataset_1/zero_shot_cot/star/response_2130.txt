Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify which nodes are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
