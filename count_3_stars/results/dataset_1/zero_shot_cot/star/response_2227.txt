Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 6: 0, 1
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 0: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- From node 4: <4, (0, 3, -)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 1, -)>

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph.  
The answer is [3].
