Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes: 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes: 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to 4 nodes: 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)> (4 in total)
- For node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)> (10 in total)
- For node 7: <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)> (4 in total)
- For node 8: <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)> (4 in total)
- For node 9: <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)> (4 in total)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 7, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 4, 8)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
