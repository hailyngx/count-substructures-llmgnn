Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.

2. Form 3-stars centered at each identified node:
   - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <9, (2, 4, 6)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
