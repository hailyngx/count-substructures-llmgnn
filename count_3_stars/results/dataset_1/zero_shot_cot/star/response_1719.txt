Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, node 1, and node 2 respectively to form 3-stars.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
  
Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: Since it is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8, we have one 3-star <0, (1, 7, 8)>.
- For node 1: Since it is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8, we have three 3-stars <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, and <1, (0, 4, 8)>.
- For node 2: Since it is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9, we have five 3-stars <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, and <2, (5, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, and <2, (5, 6, 9)>.
