Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 6)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 8, 9)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [5].
