Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with the identified node as the center.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, -)>
<4, (0, 3, -)>
<5, (0, 2, -)>
<6, (1, 2, -)>
<9, (0, 8, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
