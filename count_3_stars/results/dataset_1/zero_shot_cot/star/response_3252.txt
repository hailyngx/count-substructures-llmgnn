Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances will represent the 3-stars in the graph. 

In the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars. 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[6]

Identified 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
