Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., form a 3-star).

Let's go step by step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, nodes 0, 8, and 9 are the three neighbors of node 1.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 9. Therefore, nodes 4, 6, and 7 are the three neighbors of node 2.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. Node 3 doesn't have three neighbors, so it cannot be a part of any 3-star.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 9. Therefore, nodes 2, 5, and 6 are the three neighbors of node 4.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6. Therefore, nodes 1, 3, and 4 are the three neighbors of node 5.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7. Therefore, nodes 2, 4, and 7 are the three neighbors of node 6.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6. Therefore, nodes 1, 2, and 6 are the three neighbors of node 7.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9. Therefore, nodes 0, 1, and 9 are the three neighbors of node 8.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8. Therefore, nodes 1, 2, and 4 are the three neighbors of node 9.

2. Count the 3-stars formed by the identified central nodes and their neighbors:

   - The 3-stars are as follows:
     - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
     - <2, (4, 6, 7)>
     - <4, (2, 5, 6)>
     - <5, (1, 3, 4)>
     - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
     - <7, (1, 2, 6)>
     - <8, (0, 1, 9)>
     - <9, (1, 2, 4)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars found: [8]

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
