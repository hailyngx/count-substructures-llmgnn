Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 9, 2)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 3)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 0, 2)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9]
