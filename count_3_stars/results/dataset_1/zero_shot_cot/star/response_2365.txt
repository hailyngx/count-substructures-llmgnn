Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (7, 8, _)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, _)>
<4, (5, 8, _)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 5, _)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, _)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9]
