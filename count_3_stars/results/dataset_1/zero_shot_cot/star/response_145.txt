Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 4)>
5. <7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
