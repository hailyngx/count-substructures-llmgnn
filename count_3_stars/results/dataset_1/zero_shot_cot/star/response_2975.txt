Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node in the graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 0, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 1)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 8, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (6, 3, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Upon counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
