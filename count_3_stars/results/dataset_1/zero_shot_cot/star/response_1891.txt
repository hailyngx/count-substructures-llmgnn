Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with their adjacent nodes.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8.

Step 2: Count the 3-stars.
- Count the number of 3-stars by observing the neighbors of each node.

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars.

[<0, (1, 9, -)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 8, -)>, <8, (2, 9, -)>]
