Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
   
Node 0: 3, 5, 7  
Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 2: 8  
Node 3: 0, 1, 5  
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9  
Node 6: 1, 9  
Node 7: 0  
Node 8: 1, 2, 5  
Node 9: 1, 5, 6  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to 3 other nodes. Let's find all the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>  
<1, (3, 5, 6)>  
<1, (3, 5, 8)>  
<1, (3, 5, 9)>  
<5, (0, 1, 8)>  
<5, (0, 1, 9)>  
<8, (1, 2, 5)>  
<9, (1, 5, 6)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
