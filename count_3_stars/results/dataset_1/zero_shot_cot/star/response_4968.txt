Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of 3-stars.

The 3-star pattern consists of one central node and three leaves connected to the central node. In this case, we are looking for patterns where the center is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
