Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 0: (0, 1, 3, 5)
2. From node 1: (1, 0, 4, 8)
3. From node 3: (3, 0, 4, 5)
4. From node 4: (4, 1, 2, 3)
5. From node 5: (5, 0, 3)

Therefore, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
