Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are [<0, (3, 8, 1)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>] 3-stars in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [2].
