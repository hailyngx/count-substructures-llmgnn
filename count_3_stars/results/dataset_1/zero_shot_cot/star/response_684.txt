Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Record all nodes that are directly connected to each node:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8.
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
    - Node 7 is connected to node 2.
    - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9.
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8.

2. Identify unique 3-star patterns:
    <0, (8, 9)>  
    <1, (4, 8, 9)>
    <2, (4, 5, 8)>
    <4, (1, 2, 3)>
    <8, (0, 1, 2, 3, 9)>
    
3. As the above patterns are unique, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
