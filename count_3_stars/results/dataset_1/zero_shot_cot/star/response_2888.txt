Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to the central node in each 3-star configuration. To do this, we will look for nodes that share edges with the same node which we will consider as the center node for the corresponding 3-star. 

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars can be formed as:
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 8, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
  
[<0, (5, 9, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 3)>, <3, (4, 8, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 8, 8)>]
