Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9, forming a 3-star <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7, forming two 3-stars <1, (0, 3, 4)> and <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9, forming three 3-stars <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, and <7, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>
