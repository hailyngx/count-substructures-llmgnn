Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the vertices that are part of 3-stars. A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
