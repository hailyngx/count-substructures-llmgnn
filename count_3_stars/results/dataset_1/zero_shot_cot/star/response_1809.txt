Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 48 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0 is connected to 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to 0, and 1.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- We can see that nodes 0, 3, 6, 8 form 3-stars in the graph. Hence, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
