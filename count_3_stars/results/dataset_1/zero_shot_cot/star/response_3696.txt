Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central nodes and their neighboring nodes that form the 3-star structure.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7) => <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. Central node 1: (1, 2), (1, 7), (1, 8) => <1, (2, 7, 8)>
3. Central node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9) => <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, and <4, (5, 8, 9)> inside brackets [].
