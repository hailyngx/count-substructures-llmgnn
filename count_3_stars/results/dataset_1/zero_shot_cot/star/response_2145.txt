Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we can find the leaves (nodes connected to the center) for each 3-star and count the total number of 3-stars.

From the given graph:
- Nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes: potential centers.
- For each potential center:
  - Node 2: (2, 4, 5)
  - Node 4: (4, 2, 5)
  - Node 5: (5, 2, 4)
  - Node 6: (6, 0, 3)
  - Node 7: (7, 3, 4)
  - Node 9: (9, 4, 5)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: 
- <2, (4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5)>
- <5, (2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 3)>
- <7, (3, 4)>
- <9, (4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
