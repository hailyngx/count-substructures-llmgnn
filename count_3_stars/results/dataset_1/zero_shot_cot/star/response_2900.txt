Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's find all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1: neighbors 3, 7, 9
- Node 3: neighbors 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors 4, 5, 7
- Node 8: neighbors 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: neighbors 1, 3, 8

Next, let's count the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
