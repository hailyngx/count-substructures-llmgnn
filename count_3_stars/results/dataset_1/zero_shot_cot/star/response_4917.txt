Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

We can see that node 3 has 5 edges, making it the center of several potential 3-stars.

Starting with node 3 as the center, we find the following 3-stars:
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>

Since there are two unique 3-stars found up until now, let's continue searching:

We move to node 5 and find the following additional 3-stars:
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
