Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
Upon examining the given edges, we find that the nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9 are connected to three other nodes each. 

Next, let's form 3-stars with these nodes as the center. 
Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (2, 9, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of 6. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
