Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 8, )>
<3, (0, 1, )>
<4, (1, 9, )>
<5, (6, , )>
<6, (5, , )>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
