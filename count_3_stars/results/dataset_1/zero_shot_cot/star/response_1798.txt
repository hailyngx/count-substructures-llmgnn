Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The possible 3-star structures can be represented as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 1)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
