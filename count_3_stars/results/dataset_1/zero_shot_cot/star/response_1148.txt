Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8. Therefore, the 3-star is <0, (4, 6, 8)>.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9. Therefore, the 3-star is <1, (5, 6, 9)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 8. However, it doesn't form a 3-star as it only has two neighbors.

No more 3-stars can be formed in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 6, 8)> and <1, (5, 6, 9)>.
