Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
