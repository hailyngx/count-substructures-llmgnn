Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
3. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
4. <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
