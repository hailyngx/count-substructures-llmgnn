Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star by examining each node and its neighbors. 

Here, we have to consider only those nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and check if they form a 3-star.

Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 7.
  - <0, (3, 4, 7)>

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it is not part of a 3-star.

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it is not part of a 3-star.

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, and 7.
  - <3, (0, 1, 4)>
  - <3, (0, 4, 5)>
  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9.
  - <4, (0, 2, 9)>

- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it is not part of a 3-star.

- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it is not part of a 3-star.

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it is not part of a 3-star.

- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it is not part of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, and <4, (0, 2, 9)>.
