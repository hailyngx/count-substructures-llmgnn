Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances of a central node connected to exactly three leaves. 

1. Let's list all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3 and 4

2. Now, for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, we'll construct the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 6, -)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>

3. Counting the unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (2, 6, -)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
