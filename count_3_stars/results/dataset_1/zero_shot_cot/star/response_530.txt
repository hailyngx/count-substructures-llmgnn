Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Nodes with degree 3: Nodes 0, 6, and 1 have degree 4, so they can be centers of 3-stars.

2. For each node with degree 3, we will identify the 3 other nodes it is connected to. 
   - For node 0: (3, 4, 5)
   - For node 6: (1, 5, 9)
   - For node 1: (4, 6, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, therefore the final answer is [3].
