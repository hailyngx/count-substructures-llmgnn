Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

- For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 9)
  <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- For node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8)
  <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- For node 2: (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8)
- For node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5)
- For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)
  <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- For node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 6)
- For node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9)
  <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- For node 7: (7, 4)
- For node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9)
  <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- For node 9: (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 8)

From the above results, we found 3 unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>.
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
