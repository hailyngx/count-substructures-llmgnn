Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to node 9.

Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, node 0 cannot form a 3-star since it only has 1 connection.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to node 7.

Again, node 1 cannot form a 3-star as it only has 1 connection.

Moving on, let's identify the nodes connected to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.

Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and one more node.

Let's continue this process for the remaining nodes to find all the possible 3-stars.
