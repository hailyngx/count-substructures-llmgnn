Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph.

In this graph:
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to 4 nodes: 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes: 1, 2, 3, and 6.

There are no other nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
