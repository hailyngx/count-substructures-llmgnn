Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
We'll look for 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
