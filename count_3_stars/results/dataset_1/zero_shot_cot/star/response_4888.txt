Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 1: 2, 3, 4  
Node 2: 1, 5, 9  
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9  
Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6  
Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8  
Node 6: 4, 5, 8  
Node 7: 3, 8, 9  
Node 8: 5, 6, 7  
Node 9: 2, 3, 7  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <2, (1, 5, 9)>
3. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
4. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (2, 3, 4)>
6. <6, (4, 5, 8)>
7. <7, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
