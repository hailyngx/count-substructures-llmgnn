Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes.
    - Node 0 has degree 3
    - Node 3 has degree 5
    - Node 7 has degree 6
    - Node 9 has degree 4

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars
    - For each central node, count the number of connected triples of nodes to form 3-stars.

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

Step 3: Output the final answer
