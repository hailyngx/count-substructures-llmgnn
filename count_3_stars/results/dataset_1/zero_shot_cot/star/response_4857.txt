Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. 
    - Node 2 has edges to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
    - Node 3 has edges to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
    - Node 5 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
    - Node 6 has edges to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
    
Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars. 
    - Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes (4, 5, 8).
    - Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes (4, 6, 9).
    - Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes (0, 2, 7).
    - Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes (3, 8, 9).
    
Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars. 
    - 4 unique 3-stars are found.
    
Output: [4]   
Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>
