Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's analyze the graph to find all 3-stars:

- Node 0 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7. This creates two 3-stars:
    - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. This creates one 3-star:
    - <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8. This creates two 3-stars:
    - <4, (0, 5, 7)>
    - <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6. This creates one 3-star:
    - <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5. This creates one 3-star:
    - <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 4. This creates one 3-star:
    - <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4. This creates one 3-star:
    - <8, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].


Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
