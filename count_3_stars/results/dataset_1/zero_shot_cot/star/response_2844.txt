Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's break this down step by step:

1. We first need to identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes are potential central nodes in 3-stars.

2. For each potential central node, we need to find all possible unique combinations of nodes that are connected to it.

Let's go through the steps and find the 3-stars in the given graph:

### Step 1: Nodes with three edges connected to them
- Node 0 has 2 edges
- Node 1 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 2 edges
- Node 3 has 4 edges
- Node 4 has 3 edges
- Node 5 has 2 edges
- Node 6 has 5 edges
- Node 7 has 3 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 9 has 6 edges

### Step 2: Unique 3-stars
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (4, 6, 7)>
- <6, (6, 7, 8)>
- <6, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
