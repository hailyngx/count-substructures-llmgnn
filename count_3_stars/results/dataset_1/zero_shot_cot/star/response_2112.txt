Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Analyzing the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <1, (6, 8, 0)>
2. <4, (7, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
