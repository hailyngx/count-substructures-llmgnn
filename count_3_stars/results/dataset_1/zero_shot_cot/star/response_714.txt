Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes for 3-stars based on the given graph.  
The central nodes for potential 3-stars are nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. 
  
Central nodes:  
- Node 0 has 2 incident edges.  
- Node 1 has 3 incident edges.  
- Node 2 has 4 incident edges.  
- Node 3 has 2 incident edges.  
- Node 4 has 6 incident edges.  
- Node 5 has 4 incident edges.  
- Node 6 has 5 incident edges.  
- Node 7 has 1 incident edge.  
- Node 8 has 3 incident edges.  
- Node 9 has 2 incident edges.  
  
Potential central nodes: 1, 8  

Step 2: For each potential central node identified, check if the adjacent nodes form a 3-star.  
For node 1:  
- Incident edges: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6).  
- 3-star found: <1, (4, 5, 6)>  

For node 8:  
- Incident edges: (8, 2), (8, 7), (2, 8).  
- No 3-star found.  
  
Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.  
Number of unique 3-stars: 1  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].   

Unique 3-stars:  
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
