Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given graph:

- Total nodes: 10
- Total edges: 24
- Edges: (0, 2), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 3), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 9), (8, 1), (8, 5), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 5)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <5, (8, 9, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
