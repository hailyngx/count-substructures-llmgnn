Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
In this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. Let's list them out: 

<0, (1, 3, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (6, 9, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, None)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
