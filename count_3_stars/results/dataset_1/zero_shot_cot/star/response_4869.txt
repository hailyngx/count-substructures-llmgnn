Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 7, 3
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 6, 4
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 8, 1
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 5

Now, we can see that there are two 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <4, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
