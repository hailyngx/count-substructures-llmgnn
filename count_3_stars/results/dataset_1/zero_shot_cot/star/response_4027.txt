Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 5), (0, 3, 2), (0, 4, 2), (0, 5, 2)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 3), (2, 8, 4)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 2, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 2), (4, 2, 5), (4, 2, 8), (4, 2, 7), (4, 5, 0), (4, 5, 2), (4, 5, 7), (4, 5, 0)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 0, 4), (5, 2, 4)
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 9), (6, 9, 2)
8. Node 7: (7, 4, 5)
9. Node 8: (8, 2, 3), (8, 2, 4), (8, 2, 4), (8, 3, 2)
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 6)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 2)>, <0, (1, 4, 2)>, <0, (1, 5, 2)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>, <2, (4, 8, 3)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
