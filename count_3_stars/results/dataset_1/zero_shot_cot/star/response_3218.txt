Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors.
- Node 2 has neighbors 0 and 3.
- Node 3 has neighbors 2 and 4.
- Node 5 has neighbors 6 and 9.
- Node 6 has neighbors 5 and 7.
- Node 7 has neighbors 6 and 9.
- Node 9 has neighbors 5 and 7.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars by counting unique combinations of central node and its three neighbors. 
- There are 2 unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 3)> and <5, (6, 9)>.
