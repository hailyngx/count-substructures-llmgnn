Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (7, 4, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 9, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [11].
