Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

First, let's find all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 3 has edges to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 7 has edges to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Now, we can count the number of 3-star graphs. Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
