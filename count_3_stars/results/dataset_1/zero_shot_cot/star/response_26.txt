Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms 3-stars with (2, 5, 7) and (5, 0, 7).
2. Node 1 forms 3-stars with (2, 7, 8) and (7, 1, 8).
3. Node 2 forms 3-star with (0, 1, 7).
4. Node 4 forms 3-star with (5, 7, 9).
5. Node 5 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 5), (2, 4, 5), and (4, 5, 7).
6. Node 7 forms 3-star with (0, 1, 2).
7. Node 9 forms 3-star with (4, 5, 9).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

This can be represented as <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 0, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>.
