Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 9, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 5)>
5. <4, (2, 5, 8)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
8. <7, (3, 5, 6)>
9. <8, (4, 6, 9)>
10. <9, (0, 6, 7)>
