Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

First, let's list the nodes each node is connected to:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 5, 6.
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with nodes 6, 7, 8.
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 8, 9.
  
Therefore, there are <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)> 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
