Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star pattern by looking for nodes that are connected in the specified way. 

Given graph:
- 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 26 edges: (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 2), (8, 5), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4)

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (3, 6)>
- <1, (9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <8, (2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
