Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are the center of a 3-star pattern. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars.

- Node 0 is not the center of any 3-star.
- Node 1 is not the center of any 3-star.
- Node 2 is not the center of any 3-star.
- Node 3 is not the center of any 3-star.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 6 is not the center of any 3-star.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8 is not the center of any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <4, (0, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 2)>, and <7, (2, 3, 8)>.
