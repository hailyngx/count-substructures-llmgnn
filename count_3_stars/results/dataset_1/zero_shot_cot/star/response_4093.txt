Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes which are connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. These will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
  
  - Node 4 has 6 edges, meeting the criteria (3-star center)
  - Node 5 has 5 edges, meeting the criteria (3-star center)
  
Step 2: For each central node, identify the nodes that are connected to it by an edge to form a 3-star.

  - For node 4:
    - (4, 2, 5)
    - (4, 3, 9)
    - (4, 5, 8)
    - (4, 6, 0)
    - (4, 8, 2)
    - (4, 9, 3)
  
  - For node 5:
    - (5, 0, 6)
    - (5, 2, 4)
    - (5, 4, 2)
    - (5, 6, 0)
    - (5, 7, 1)  
  
Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars identified.

<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 9, 4)>
<4, (6, 0, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (4, 2, 5)>
<5, (6, 0, 5)>
