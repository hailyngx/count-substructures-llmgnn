Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5].
