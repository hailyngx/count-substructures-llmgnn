Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, x)>

Count = 4
