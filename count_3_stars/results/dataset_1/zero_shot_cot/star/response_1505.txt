Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list all 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (5, 9)>
<1, (4, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 8)>
<8, (4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
