Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that have three edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars.  
Nodes with three edges:
- Node 5
- Node 7
- Node 9

Step 2: For each node identified in Step 1, check if the nodes connected to it by edges form a 3-star configuration.  
For Node 5: (0, 7), (1, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (6, 2), (7, 0) -> Forms a 3-star with Node 5 as the center.  
Unique 3-star found: <5, (0, 2, 7)>

For Node 7: (0, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0), (8, 7) -> Does not form a 3-star.

For Node 9: (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 3) -> Does not form a 3-star.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars identified.  
Total 3-stars: 1

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
