Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify which nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:

Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8 are connected to 3 other nodes. 
Nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9 are not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
  
2. For each node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, determine the 3-star they form:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, and <8, (3, 4, 0)>.
