Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. <0, (2, 9, 1)> 
2. <1, (4, 8, 2)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (7, 5, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 8)>
6. <5, (3, 7, 9)>
7. <6, (5, 8, -)> (Note: Node 6 is connected to only two other nodes)
8. <7, (3, 5, -)> (Note: Node 7 is connected to only two other nodes)
9. <8, (1, 4, 2)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, we have found that there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
