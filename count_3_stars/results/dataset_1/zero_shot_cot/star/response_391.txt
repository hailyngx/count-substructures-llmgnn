Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. 

Central Nodes:  
- Node 2 is a central node with incident edges (1, 2), (2, 3), and (2, 4).  
- Node 3 is a central node with incident edges (0, 3), (2, 3), and (3, 4).  
- Node 8 is a central node with incident edges (1, 8), (2, 8), and (8, 9).  

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. 3-star with central node 2: <2, (1, 2, 4)>
2. 3-star with central node 3: <3, (0, 3, 4)>
3. 3-star with central node 8: <8, (1, 8, 9)>
