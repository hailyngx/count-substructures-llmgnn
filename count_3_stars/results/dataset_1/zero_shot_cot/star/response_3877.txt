Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (7, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, -)>
<3, (2, -, -)>
<4, (0, -, -)>
<5, (0, 6, -)>
<6, (5, 7, -)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 8, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
