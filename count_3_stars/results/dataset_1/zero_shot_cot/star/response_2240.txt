Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three edges connected to it, forming a 3-star pattern.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
