Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with three neighbors are 1, 4, and 7. 

Now, let's focus on each central node and identify the 3-stars that can be formed:
1. For central node 1, the 3-stars can be formed with the following leaves:
    - Leaves: 2, 3, 8
    <1, (2, 3, 8)>
2. For central node 4, the 3-stars can be formed with the following leaves:
    - Leaves: 6, 7, 8
    <4, (6, 7, 8)>
3. For central node 7, the 3-stars can be formed with the following leaves:
    - Leaves: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
    <7, (2, 4, 5)>
    <7, (4, 6, 8)>
    <7, (2, 6, 8)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>.
