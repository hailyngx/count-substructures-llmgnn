Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degrees. 

- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 1

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

[The total number of 3-stars is [5].]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 5, -)>
- <8, (0, 3, 7)>
