Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the graph, i.e., the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Central nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9

Now, we will list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find: [4].
