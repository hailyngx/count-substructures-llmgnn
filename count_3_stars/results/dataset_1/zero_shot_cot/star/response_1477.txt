Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (4, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
7. <8, (3, 7, 9)>

Now, let's count and list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
