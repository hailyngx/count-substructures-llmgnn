Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 3 and 9
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, and 6
- Node 5 is connected to Node 8
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, and 8
- Nodes 7 is connected to Nodes 2 and 3
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, and 6
- Node 9 is connected to Node 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 9, 0)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 0, 7)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 9, 4)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 2, 7)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (8, 0, 0)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (8, 2, 9)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 9, 2)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 0, 6)>
10. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
