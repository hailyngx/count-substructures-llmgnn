Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 9, 0)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 8)>
- <5, (2, 0, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (0, 9, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [22].
