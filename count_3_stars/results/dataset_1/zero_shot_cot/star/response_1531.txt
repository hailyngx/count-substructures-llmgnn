Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 8), (0, 3, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 6), (1, 3, 8), (1, 4, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 1, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 0, 4), (3, 0, 9), (3, 1, 4)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 7), (4, 3, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 2), (5, 1, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 8), (6, 1, 9), (6, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 2, 4), (7, 4, 5), (7, 4, 6), (7, 5, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 3, 4), (8, 3, 5), (8, 3, 6), (8, 4, 5), (8, 4, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 6)

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have found <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
