Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections in the given graph. 
The connections can be represented as follows:

Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3, 9
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 0
Node 5: 8
Node 6: 8, 9
Node 7: 9
Node 8: 5, 6
Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-star structures in this graph. 
We have the following 3-star structures:
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<1, (3, 9, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
