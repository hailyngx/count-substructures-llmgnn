Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify which nodes are connected to each node in the graph. Here is the list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8

Next, we can start counting the 3-stars. Let's go through each node and see if it forms any 3-stars.

For each potential central node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 2: <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: No 3-stars
- Node 5: No 3-stars
- Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
