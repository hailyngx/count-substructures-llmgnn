Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's go through the steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.

2. Count the 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
   - <2, (0, 6, 9)>
   - <6, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 7)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [3].
