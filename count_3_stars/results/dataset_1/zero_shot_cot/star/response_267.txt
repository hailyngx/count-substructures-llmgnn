Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 9, -)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 3)> and <4, (6, 9, -)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 4, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
