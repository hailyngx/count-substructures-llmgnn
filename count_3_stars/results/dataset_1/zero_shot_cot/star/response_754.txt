Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars it contains.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Nodes with degree 3 are potential centers of 3-stars.

In this graph, the nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Step 2: For each potential center node, find all unique 3-stars it forms.

- Center node 0: (0, 2, 9) - Forms a 3-star. <0, (2, 9)>
- Center node 1: (1, 3, 9) - Forms a 3-star. <1, (3, 9)>
- Center node 3: (3, 1, 7) - Forms a 3-star. <3, (1, 7)>
- Center node 4: (4, 2) - Does not form a 3-star.
- Center node 5: (5, 7, 8), (5, 9, 7), (5, 9, 8) - Forms 3 different 3-stars. <5, (7, 8)>, <5, (9, 7)>, <5, (9, 8)>
- Center node 7: (7, 3, 8), (7, 5, 8), (7, 8, 9) - Forms 3 different 3-stars. <7, (3, 8)>, <7, (5, 8)>, <7, (8, 9)>
- Center node 8: (8, 5, 7), (8, 9, 5), (8, 9, 7) - Forms 3 different 3-stars. The same 3-stars as center node 7.
- Center node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 5, 6), (9, 8, 5) - Forms 3 different 3-stars. <9, (0, 1)>, <9, (5, 6)>, <9, (8, 5)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars.
- Total unique 3-stars: 1 (from center node 0) + 1 (from center node 1) + 1 (from center node 3) + 3 (from center node 5) + 3 (from center node 7) + 3 (from center node 9) = 12
