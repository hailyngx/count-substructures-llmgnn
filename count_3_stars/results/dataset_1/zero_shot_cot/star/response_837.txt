Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with Nodes 2, 4, 6. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with Nodes 0, 3, 4. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with Nodes 2, 4, 9. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with Nodes 0, 2, 3. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with Nodes 7, 8, 9. <5, (7, 8, 9)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with Nodes 1, 3, 5. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
