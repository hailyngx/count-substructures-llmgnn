Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly three neighbors. 
From the given edges, the central nodes are nodes: 0, 2, 3, 9.

For each central node, we can form a 3-star by selecting three of its neighbors as leaves. 
Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars in this graph: 
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get: [4].
