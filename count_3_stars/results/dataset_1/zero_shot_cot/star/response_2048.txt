Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's begin by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, -)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 8, -)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars listed above and output the final answer inside brackets:

[8]
