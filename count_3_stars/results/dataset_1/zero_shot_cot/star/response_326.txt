Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in this given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <5, (3, 4, 8)>
6. <6, (1, 7, None)>
7. <7, (2, 3, 6)>
8. <8, (4, 5, None)>
9. <9, (0, 1, 5)>
