Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the possible 3-stars in the graph. The central nodes will be the nodes with exactly three neighbors.

In this case, nodes 1, 4, and 6 are the only nodes with three neighbors each. So, we will consider these nodes as potential central nodes for the 3-stars.

Next, let's check the nodes adjacent to each potential central node to see if they form a 3-star.

For node 1:
- (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6)
   - <1, (2, 4, 6)>

For node 4:
- (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8)
   - <4, (1, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
- (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7)
   - <6, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>>.
