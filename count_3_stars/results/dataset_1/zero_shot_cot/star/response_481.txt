Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly three edges, as these nodes can be central nodes of 3-stars. 
2. For each identified central node, find the nodes connected to it through edges and form the 3-star sets. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three edges: Nodes 0 and 5.

2. 3-stars with central node 0:
    - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (4, 6, 9)>
  
3. 3-stars with central node 5:
    - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <5, (1, 7, 9)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars.
