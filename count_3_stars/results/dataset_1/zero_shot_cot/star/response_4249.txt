Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Once we identify such nodes, we can form 3-stars with them as the central node.

In this graph, node 0, node 3, and node 6 are connected to three other nodes each, making them the potential central nodes for 3-stars. Let's list the 3-stars with these central nodes:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found gives us [4].
