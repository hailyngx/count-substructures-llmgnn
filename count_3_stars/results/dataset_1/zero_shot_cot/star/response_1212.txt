Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3.

From the given edges:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 1

Nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7 are the central nodes.

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:
- Central node 1 has leaves 3, 5, 7, 9
- Central node 3 has leaves 0, 1, 5, 7
- Central node 5 has leaves 1, 3, 8
- Central node 7 has leaves 1, 3, 4, 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
