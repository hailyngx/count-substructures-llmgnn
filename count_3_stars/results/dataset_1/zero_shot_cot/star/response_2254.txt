Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 8, X)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, X, X)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, X)>
<8, (1, 2, X)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
