Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- From node 1: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 7, 8)> and <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- From node 4: <4, (1, 2, 6)> and <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- From node 6: <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- From node 7: <7, (1, 3, 5)> and <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- From node 8: <8, (3, 4, 5)> and <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
