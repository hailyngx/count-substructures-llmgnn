Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (3, 4, 9)
- Node 2: (1, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 5, 6), (0, 6, 9), (5, 6, 7), (6, 7, 9)
- Node 5: (4, 6, 7)
- Node 6: (2, 4, 7)
- Node 7: (2, 5, 6)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [15]  
List of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>
