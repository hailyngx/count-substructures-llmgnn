Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (3-stars). 

Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes (4 and 5) which does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes (5, 6, 8):
  <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 is connected to 1 node (9) which does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 6, 7, 8):
  <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes (0, 1) which does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes (1, 4) which does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to 1 node (4) which does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes (1, 4) which does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to 1 node (3) which does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars are: <<1, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>>.
