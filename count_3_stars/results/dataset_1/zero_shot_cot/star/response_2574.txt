Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

Next, we can identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 3)>
4. <3, (1, 5, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 8)>
6. <5, (2, 3, 4)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
8. <8, (0, 4, 9)>

Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, resulting in [8].
