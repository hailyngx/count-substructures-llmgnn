Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 7, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, -)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
