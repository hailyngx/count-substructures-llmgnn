Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Given the number of nodes and edges, we know that the degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 3

Since we are looking for 3-star graphs, we need to find nodes that have degree 3 with exactly 3 neighbors.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 6, 7, 9.

Now, let's list the 3-star structures in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
