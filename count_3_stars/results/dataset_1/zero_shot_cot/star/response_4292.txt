Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with degree 3 in the given graph.

Based on the edges provided:
- Node 2 has degree 5.
- Node 6 has degree 4.
- All other nodes have degree less than 3.

So, the central nodes of the 3-stars in this graph can only be nodes 2 and 6.

Now, let's find the leaves of the 3-stars connected to node 2:
- Nodes 0, 8, 3, and 4 are connected to node 2.

Now, let's find the leaves of the 3-stars connected to node 6:
- Nodes 1, 5, and 9 are connected to node 6.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have [5].
