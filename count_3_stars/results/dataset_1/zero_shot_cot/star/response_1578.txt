Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all the nodes with a degree of 3 in the given graph.

By observing the edges, we can see that nodes with a degree of 3 are: 1, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find all the unique 3-star configurations involving these central nodes:   

<1, (2, 5, 6)>  
<7, (0, 2, 9)>  
<8, (0, 6, 9)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
