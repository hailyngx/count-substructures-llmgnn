Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
   
   - Central Node 0: (0, 1, 6), (0, 6, 8), (0, 1, 8) 
   - Central Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 8)
   - Central Node 2: (2, 1, 6), (2, 6, 9)
   - Central Node 3: Not a central node in any 3-star
   - Central Node 4: Not a central node in any 3-star
   - Central Node 5: Not a central node in any 3-star
   - Central Node 6: (6, 0, 2), (6, 0, 4), (6, 2, 4), (6, 4, 8), (6, 7, 8)
   - Central Node 7: (7, 6, 8)
   - Central Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 0, 6), (8, 1, 6), (8, 4, 6), (8, 6, 7), (8, 6, 9)
   - Central Node 9: Not a central node in any 3-star

In total, we have 15 unique 3-stars as identified above. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15]. 

<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (6, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
