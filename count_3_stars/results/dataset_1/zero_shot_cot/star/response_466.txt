Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We can start by identifying the central node for each 3-star. The central node will be the node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

By looking at the list of edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Central Node: 0, Leaves: 3, 6, 9
2. Central Node: 3, Leaves: 0, 2, 4
3. Central Node: 4, Leaves: 1, 3, 8
4. Central Node: 6, Leaves: 0, 1, 8
5. Central Node: 9, Leaves: 0, 2, 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
