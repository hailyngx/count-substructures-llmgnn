Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 8)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 5)
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 9), (2, 7, 8), (2, 7, 9), (2, 8, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 2, 6), (3, 2, 9)
5. Node 7: (7, 0, 2)
6. Node 8: (8, 0, 2)
7. Node 9: (9, 2, 3)

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 5)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <3, (2, 6)>, <3, (2, 9)>, <7, (0, 2)>, <8, (0, 2)>, <9, (2, 3)>
