Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- <2, (1, 5, 4)>

3. Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6.
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>

7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- <7, (6, 8, 1)>

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- <8, (1, 7, 6)>

9. Node 9 is connected to node 6.
- <9, (6, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
