Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-star structures: 

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, None)>
<6, (0, 1, None)>
<7, (0, 4, None)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (8, None, None)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph. 
   
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
