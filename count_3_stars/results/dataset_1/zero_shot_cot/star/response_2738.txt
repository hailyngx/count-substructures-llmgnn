Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 9, 2)>
<1, (3, 7, 0)>
<2, (4, 9, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Counting the above 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
