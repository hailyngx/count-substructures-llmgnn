Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars.
    
Potential centers: nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Step 2: For each potential center, check if it forms a 3-star configuration.

- Checking potential center node 1:
    - (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7) form a 3-star.
    - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
    
- Checking potential center node 2:
    - (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8) form a 3-star.
    - <2, (1, 5, 8)>

- Checking potential center node 4:
    - (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 9) form a 3-star.
    - <4, (1, 8, 9)>

- Checking potential center node 5:
    - (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7) form a 3-star.
    - (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 8) also form a 3-star.
    - (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8) also form a 3-star.
    - <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>

- Checking potential center node 7:
    - (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3) do not form a 3-star.
    - (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5) form a 3-star.
    - (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5) form a 3-star.
    - (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8) form a 3-star.
    - (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 8) form a 3-star.
    - <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>

- Checking potential center node 8:
    - (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4) do not form a 3-star.
    - (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5) form a 3-star.
    - (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7) form a 3-star.
    - (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 7) form a 3-star.
    - (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 4) form a 3-star.
    - <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars found.
    
Total number of unique 3-stars: 11
