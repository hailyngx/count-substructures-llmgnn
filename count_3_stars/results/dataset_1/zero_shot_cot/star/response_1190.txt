Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars, which are central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<1, (2, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, -)>
<6, (8, 9, -)>
<8, (6, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [8].
