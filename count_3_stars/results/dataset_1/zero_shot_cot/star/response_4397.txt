Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected to more or less than three other nodes. However, nodes 7, 8, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: For each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, identify the 3-star structures.

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 1, 2)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 9:
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>
- <9, (8, 7, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.
