Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star. In a 3-star, there is always a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (2, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (4, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (3, 6, 7)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 4)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
