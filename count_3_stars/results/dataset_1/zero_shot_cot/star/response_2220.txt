Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 6) => <0, (2, 3, 4)> and <0, (2, 3, 6)> and <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9) => <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 8) => No 3-star.
4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6) => <3, (0, 1, 6)>
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 8) => <4, (0, 1, 6)>
6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9) => <5, (1, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5) => <6, (0, 3, 4)> and <6, (3, 4, 5)> and <6, (0, 4, 5)>
8. Node 7: (7, 1) => No 3-star.
9. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 9) => <8, (1, 4, 5)> and <8, (1, 5, 9)> and <8, (1, 4, 9)>
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 8) => <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>
