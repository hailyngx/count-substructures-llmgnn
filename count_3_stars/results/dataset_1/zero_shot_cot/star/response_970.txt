Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes that form 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- Node 0 has nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 connected to it.
- Node 1 has nodes 4, 7 connected to it.
- Node 2 has nodes 0, 9 connected to it.
- Node 3 has nodes 0, 7, 9 connected to it.
- Node 4 has nodes 0, 1, 5, 6 connected to it.
- Node 5 has nodes 4, 8 connected to it.
- Node 6 has node 4 connected to it.
- Node 7 has nodes 0, 1, 3 connected to it.
- Node 8 has nodes 5, 9 connected to it.
- Node 9 has nodes 0, 2, 3, 8 connected to it.

Now, let's count the number of distinct 3-star graphs. 
Here is the list of 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
