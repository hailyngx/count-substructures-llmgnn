Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 4
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Number of 3-stars with Node 0 as the center:
  - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
  - <0, (1, 7, 9)>
  - <0, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
  - Total: 4
  
- Number of 3-stars with Node 1 as the center:
  - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
  - Total: 1

- Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center:
  - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
  - Total: 2

- Number of 3-stars with Node 4 as the center:
  - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
  - Total: 1

- Number of 3-stars with Node 6 as the center:
  - <6, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (4, 5, 7)>
  - Total: 2

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
