Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the center nodes of the 3-stars. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with degree 3 in the given graph. 

In this case, node 7 has a degree of 7, which means it can be the center node of multiple 3-stars. Let's find all the 3-stars with node 7 as the center:

1. <7, (0, 1, 2)>
2. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
3. <7, (1, 5, 6)>
4. <7, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <7, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <7, (1, 2, 6)>
7. <7, (2, 3, 7)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
9. <7, (7, 8, 9)>
10. <7, (7, 0, 1)>
11. <7, (7, 1, 2)>
12. <7, (7, 1, 3)>
13. <7, (7, 1, 5)>
14. <7, (7, 1, 6)>
15. <7, (7, 2, 3)>
16. <7, (7, 3, 9)>

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
