Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is the center of a 3-star. We can identify a 3-star by looking for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7. Therefore, <0, (2, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has edges with nodes 3 and 5, but it's not the center of any 3-star as it does not have exactly three neighbors.
3. Node 2 has edges with nodes 0 and 8. It's not the center of a 3-star as it does not have exactly three neighbors.
4. Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 6, and 8. Therefore, <3, (1, 6, 8)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 6, and 8. Therefore, <4, (0, 6, 8)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 5 has edges with node 1, but it's not the center of any 3-star as it does not have exactly three neighbors.
7. Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8. Therefore, <6, (0, 3, 4)> and <6, (0, 4, 7)> are 3-stars.
8. Node 7 has edges with nodes 0 and 6, but it's not the center of any 3-star as it does not have exactly three neighbors.
9. Node 8 has edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, <8, (2, 3, 4)> and <8, (3, 4, 5)> are 3-stars.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, and <8, (3, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
