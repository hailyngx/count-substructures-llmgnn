Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
