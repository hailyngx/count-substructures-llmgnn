Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node with exactly three edges (leaves) connected to it. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
3. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
4. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
5. Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
