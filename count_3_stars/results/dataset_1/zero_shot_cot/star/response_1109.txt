Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the nodes connected to each node, and then check for 3-stars in the graph. 

Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.  
Node 2 is connected to node 7.  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.  
Node 4 is connected to node 8.  
Node 5 is connected to node 0.  
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.  
Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.  
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.  

Let's now list the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<[0, (5, 9)]>  
<[3, (8, 9)]>  
<[7, (2, 9)]>  

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
