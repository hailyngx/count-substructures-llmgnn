Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then form 3-stars using these nodes as centers. 

Starting from Node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to 6 other nodes (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9), making it a potential center for 3-stars. However, it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Moving to Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 7, 9), making it a center node for a 3-star. The 3-star is <1, (0, 7, 9)>.

Moving to Node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to 2 other nodes (0, 6), so it cannot be a center for a 3-star.

Moving to Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to 2 other nodes (5, 9), so it cannot be a center for a 3-star.

Moving to Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 5, 7), making it a center for a 3-star. The 3-star is <4, (0, 5, 7)>.

Moving to Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 3, 4, 9), making it a potential center for 3-stars. However, it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Moving to Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 2, 7, 8), making it a potential center for 3-stars. However, it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Moving to Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 4, 6), making it a center for a 3-star. The 3-star is <7, (1, 4, 6)>.

Moving to Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes (6, 9), so it cannot be a center for a 3-star.

Moving to Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to 5 other nodes (0, 1, 3, 5, 8), making it a potential center for 3-stars. However, it is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <1, (0, 7, 9)> and <4, (0, 5, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
