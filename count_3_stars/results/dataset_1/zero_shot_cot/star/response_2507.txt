Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to three other nodes. These nodes are the central nodes of the 3-stars.
From the given edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (5, 6)>
