Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node for each potential 3-star.  
We can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7 have degree 4, while nodes 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9 have degree 2 in this graph.  
So the potential central nodes are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7.

Let's look for 3-stars in the graph with one of these nodes as the center.
For each of these nodes, we'll find the nodes connected to it and check if they share an edge between them.

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>

For node 4:
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <6, (4, 5, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
- <7, (2, 4, 6)>
- <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in this graph.
