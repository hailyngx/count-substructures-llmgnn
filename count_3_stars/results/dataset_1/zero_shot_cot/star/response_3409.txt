Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 8, 1)>
2. <1, (3, 0, 9)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 9)>
4. <4, (3, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
6. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
7. <7, (3, 5, 8)>
8. <9, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of 8. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
