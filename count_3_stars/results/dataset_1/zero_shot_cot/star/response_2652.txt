Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all possible combinations where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the graph information, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>

Count: [4]
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
