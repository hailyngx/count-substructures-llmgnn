Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes connected to the center (node 0) in order to find all the possible 3-stars in the graph.  
The nodes connected to node 0 are: 1, 4, 5, and 9.  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.  
Since a 3-star consists of a center node and exactly three leaves, we have the following possibilities:
- For node 0: (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 9), (1, 4, 9)
- For node 1: (0, 6, 9)
- For node 4: (0, 8, 9)
- For node 5: (0, 9, 9)
- For node 9: (0, 5, 6)

Counting all of these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 9, 9)>
