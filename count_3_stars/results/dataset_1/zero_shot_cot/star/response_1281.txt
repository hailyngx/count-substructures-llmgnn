Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4
- Node 9: 6

Now we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list the 3-stars with their central node and leaves:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 8, N/A)>
- <5, (7, N/A, N/A)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
