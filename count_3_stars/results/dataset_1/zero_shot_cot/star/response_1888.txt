Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are a total of [10] nodes and [30] edges in the graph given. 

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node of each 3-star and then find the 3 other nodes connected to it. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 2)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
