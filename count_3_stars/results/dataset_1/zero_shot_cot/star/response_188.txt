Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars. 

Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the list of edges provided, we see that the nodes are connected as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. The possible 3-stars are:
   - <0, (2, 5, 9)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <2, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <7, (1, 2, 6)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
