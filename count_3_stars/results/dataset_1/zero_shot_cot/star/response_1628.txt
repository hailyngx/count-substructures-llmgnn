Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the central node of each potential 3-star.
2. For each central node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. If the conditions are met, count it as a 3-star.

Let's begin by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars [<total_number_of_3-stars>].

The total number of 3-stars is [10].
