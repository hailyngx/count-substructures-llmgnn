Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes directly.

Given the edges provided, we can see that the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6
- Node 3 is connected to node 0
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 1
- Node 5 is connected to node 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7

Let's enumerate the possible 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
3. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
4. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <5, (6)>
6. <7, (0, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
