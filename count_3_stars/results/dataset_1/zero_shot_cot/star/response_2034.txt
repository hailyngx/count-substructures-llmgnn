Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking at each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star configuration.

Given the edges in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Nodes 8 and 9 have only one connection each.

Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars that can be formed in this graph:
<0, (1, 8, x)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, x)>
<6, (1, 4, x)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 8, x)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, x)>, <6, (1, 4, x)>
