Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Number of 3-stars = Number of nodes that act as the center of a 3-star

Looking at the given graph, we can see that the possible nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars for each of these nodes:
  
For node 2:
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
  
For node 4:
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>

For node 5:
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>
  
For node 7:
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
