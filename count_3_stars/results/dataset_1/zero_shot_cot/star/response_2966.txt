Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars from the list above, we find that there are 7 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
