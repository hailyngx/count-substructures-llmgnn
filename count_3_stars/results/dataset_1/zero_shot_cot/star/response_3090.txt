Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly one edge, as these nodes could potentially be the centers of the 3-stars.  
From the given edges, nodes 0, 5, and 9 have exactly one edge each. Now, we will check all the unique 3-stars that can be formed using each of these nodes as the center.

1. For node 0:
   - No 3-star can be formed since node 0 has only one edge.

2. For node 5:
   - No 3-star can be formed since node 5 has only one edge.

3. For node 9:
   - No 3-star can be formed since node 9 has only one edge.

Therefore, in this graph, there are no 3-stars present.  
So, the final answer is [0].
