Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 1, 2, 7

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 0, 3, 4

3. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 0, 5, 6

4. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 1, 5, 7

5. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 1, 6, 7

6. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 2, 3

7. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 2, 4

8. Central node: 7
   Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 4

9. Central node: 8
   Leaves: 3

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So the final answer is [9].  
<0, (1, 2, 7)> <1, (0, 3, 4)> <2, (0, 5, 6)> <3, (1, 5, 7)> <4, (1, 6, 7)> <5, (2, 3)> <6, (2, 4)> <7, (0, 2, 3, 4)> <8, (3)>
