Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Starting from the central node, we can identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
6. <5, (4)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
8. <7, (1, 3)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
10. <9, (8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
