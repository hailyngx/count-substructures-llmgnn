Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-star configurations. 

Let's list the 3-stars first:
<0, (2, 6, 1)>
<1, (3, 8, 2)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 9, 0)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [6].
