Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each node found in step 1, check if it forms a 3-star with its three neighbors.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8

2. Identify 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <7, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <8, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <9, (0, 4, 8)>

3. Total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer, inside brackets, is [5].
