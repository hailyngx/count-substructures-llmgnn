Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves in the graph. 

From the given edges, we can identify the central nodes along with their leaves:
1. Node 0: Leaves {2, 7, 9}
2. Node 1: Leaves {2, 5, 6}
3. Node 2: Leaves {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
4. Node 3: Leaves {2, 4, 6}
5. Node 4: Leaves {3, 5, 7, 9}
6. Node 5: Leaves {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}
7. Node 6: Leaves {1, 2, 3, 7}
8. Node 7: Leaves {0, 4, 5, 6}
9. Node 8: Leaves {5}
10. Node 9: Leaves {0, 4}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

Total number of 3-stars: 7

[7]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
