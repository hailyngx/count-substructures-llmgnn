Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 4, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 1, 6
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <8, (1, 4, 6)>
- [4]
