Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
3. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
4. <1, (2, 6, 9)>
5. <2, (0, 1, 9)>
6. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
7. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
8. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
9. <6, (0, 4, 7)>
10. <6, (1, 3, 9)>
11. <6, (3, 4, 7)>
12. <9, (1, 2, 3)>
13. <9, (2, 4, 6)>
14. <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
