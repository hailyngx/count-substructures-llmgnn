Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need to find a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the possible 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
6. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
7. <7, (3, 6, 9)>
8. <9, (2, 7, -)>

Now we count the unique 3-stars found: [8].
