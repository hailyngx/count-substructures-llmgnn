Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. In this case, nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6 are central nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For central node 0:
  - <0, (2, 5)>
- For central node 1:
  - <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- For central node 4:
  - <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- For central node 6:
  - <6, (1, 5)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
