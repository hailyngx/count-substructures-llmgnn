Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree = 2
- Node 1: Degree = 1
- Node 2: Degree = 4
- Node 3: Degree = 5
- Node 4: Degree = 3
- Node 5: Degree = 4
- Node 6: Degree = 1
- Node 7: Degree = 2
- Node 8: Degree = 2
- Node 9: Degree = 4

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. So, we need to find nodes with a degree of 3 and then check if the connected nodes form a 3-star.

Nodes with a degree of 3 are:
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4

Therefore, we have 2 unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)> and <5, (0, 3, 4)>.
