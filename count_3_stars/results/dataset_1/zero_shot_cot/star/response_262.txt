Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can see that:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7

Therefore, we have identified 5 potential 3-stars in this graph. Now, let's check if any of these potential 3-stars are actually valid 3-stars by verifying that all edges exist between the center and the other three nodes.

Checking each potential 3-star:
1. <0, (1, 5, 7)> - Valid
2. <1, (0, 7, 8)> - Valid
3. <5, (0, 2, 8)> - Valid
4. <7, (0, 1, 8)> - Valid
5. <8, (1, 5, 7)> - Valid

Therefore, all 5 potential 3-stars are valid in this graph. The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
