Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the possible 3-stars:
1. (0, 5) - Center: 0, Leaves: 5, 6
2. (1, 2) - Center: 1, Leaves: 4, 5, 9
3. (1, 4) - Center: 1, Leaves: 2, 8, 9
4. (1, 5) - Center: 1, Leaves: 0, 9
5. (5, 0) - Center: 5, Leaves: 1, 6
6. (0, 6) - Center: 0, Leaves: 5
7. (4, 1) - Center: 4, Leaves: 2, 8
8. (4, 8) - Center: 4, Leaves: 1
9. (1, 9) - Center: 1, Leaves: 2, 4
10. (9, 1) - Center: 9, Leaves: 1

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 8)>
<9, (1, 2)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
