Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and the leaves that are connected to them. A 3-star graph has the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central Node: 0
   Leaves: 2, 5, 6
   <0, (2, 5, 6)>
   
2. Central Node: 2
   Leaves: 0, 7, 9
   <2, (0, 7, 9)>
   
3. Central Node: 6
   Leaves: 0, 1, 3
   Leaves: 4, 5, 7
   Leaves: 8
   This results in three different 3-stars:
   <6, (0, 1, 3)>
   <6, (4, 5, 7)>
   <6, (8)>
   
4. Central Node: 9
   Leaves: 1, 2, 5
   <9, (1, 2, 5)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

[<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (8)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>]
