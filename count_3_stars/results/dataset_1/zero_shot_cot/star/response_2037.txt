Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are:
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
