Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 8)   <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 6, 8), (1, 8, 9)   <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1)                      <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. Node 5: (5, 0, 4)                      <5, (0, 4, 9)>
5. Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 1, 7), (8, 0, 9)   <8, (0, 1, 7)>
6. Node 9: (9, 1, 4), (9, 4, 5), (9, 1, 8)   <9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
