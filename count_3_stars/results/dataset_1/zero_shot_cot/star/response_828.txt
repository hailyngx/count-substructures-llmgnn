Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. 
The nodes with exactly three edges are potential central nodes. 
From the given edges, nodes 0, 1, and 5 have exactly three edges each. 

Now, we will find all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (1, 5, 6)>

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (5, 8, 9)>

3. For node 5:
   - <5, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (7, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [7].
