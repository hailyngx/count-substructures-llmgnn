Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes in each 3-star. 

First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
