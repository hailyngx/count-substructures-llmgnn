Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly 1 edge to form a 3-star. 

Nodes connected to node 0: 3, 5
Nodes connected to node 1: 3, 7
Nodes connected to node 2: 4, 5, 8
Nodes connected to node 3: 0, 1, 8
Nodes connected to node 4: 2
Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 2, 6
Nodes connected to node 6: 5
Nodes connected to node 7: 1, 9
Nodes connected to node 8: 2, 3, 9
Nodes connected to node 9: 7, 8

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 5)> 
<1, (3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (1, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
