Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes can act as centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 7

Step 2: For each identified central node, find all possible 3-stars connected to it.

For Node 5:
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>

For Node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 4, 8)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

[Total number of 3-stars: 18]
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
