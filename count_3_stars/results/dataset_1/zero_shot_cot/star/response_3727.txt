Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Let's list them and count how many are there.

<0, (4, 8, -)>  
<1, (2, 3, 6)>  
<2, (1, 3, 5)>  
<3, (1, 2, 5)>  
<5, (2, 3, 6)>  
<6, (1, 3, 5)>  
<8, (0, 1, 2)>  

So, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
