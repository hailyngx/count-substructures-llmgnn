Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (4, 8, 3)>
3. <2, (8, 9, 3)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <5, (0, 6, 8)>
6. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
7. <8, (1, 2, 4)>
8. <9, (2, 3, 8)>

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
