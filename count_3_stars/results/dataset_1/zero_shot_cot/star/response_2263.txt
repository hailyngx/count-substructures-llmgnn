Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (1, 9)>.
- Node 5 forms three 3-stars: <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>.
