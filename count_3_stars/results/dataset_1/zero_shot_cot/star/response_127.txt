Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's break it down step-by-step:
1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
2. Check if those nodes form a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of 3-stars.

Here are the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4
- Node 4: connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6
- Node 6: connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 8: connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7
- Node 9: connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6

From the above nodes, we can form the following 3-stars:
1. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
2. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
3. <6, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <8, (3, 6, 7)>
5. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
