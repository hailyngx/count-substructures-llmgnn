Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 3)>
7. <6, (3, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
9. <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
