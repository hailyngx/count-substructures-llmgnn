Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list out all the possible 3-stars based on the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 0)>
<1, (0, 6, 1)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
