Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
