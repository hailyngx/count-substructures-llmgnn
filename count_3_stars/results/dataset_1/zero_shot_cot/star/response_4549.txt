Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Then we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Central node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Central nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 do not have 3-star configurations because they have less than 3 adjacent nodes. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For central node 0: (0, 1, 5), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 8), (0, 1, 9) -> 4 3-stars
- For central node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 4), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 8) -> 4 3-stars
- For central node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 4), (3, 1, 5), (3, 1, 6) -> 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 4)>.
