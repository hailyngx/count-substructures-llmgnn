Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the central nodes in the graph. These central nodes will be the nodes with exactly three neighbors.

2. For each central node, find the sets of nodes connected to it by edges to form 3-stars.

Let's first identify the central nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 8, 9)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 6)

From the analysis above, we see that nodes 0, 4, and 6 are the central nodes (each having exactly 3 neighbors). Node 8 has 5 neighbors and cannot form 3-stars.

Now, let's find the 3-stars corresponding to each central node:

- For node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.
- For node 4: <4, (0, 5, 9)> is a 3-star.
- For node 6: <6, (0, 2, 9)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, and <6, (0, 2, 9)>.
