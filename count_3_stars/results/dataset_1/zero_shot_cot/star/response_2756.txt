Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 9.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
