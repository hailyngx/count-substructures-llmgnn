Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

[There are 6 3-stars in the given graph.]
