Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
We need to find the 3-stars in the given graph. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges:
   - Node 0 has 4 edges (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)
   - Node 1 has 3 edges (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5)
   - Node 5 has 4 edges (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8)
   - Node 7 has 6 edges (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9)
   - Node 8 has 4 edges (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7)
   - Node 9 has 2 edges (9, 3), (9, 7)

2. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:
   - Node 0 does not form any 3-stars (as it has 4 edges).
   - Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 5)>.
   - Node 5 forms two 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 7)> and <5, (0, 7, 8)>.
   - Node 7 forms three 3-stars: <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, and <7, (8, 9, 7)>.
   - Node 8 forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 7)>.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [7].
   
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (8, 9, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>.

So, the final answer is [7].
