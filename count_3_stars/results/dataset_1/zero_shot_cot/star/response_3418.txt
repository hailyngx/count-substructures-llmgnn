Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges, as these could potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly 3 edges are: 3, 5, 8, 9.

Next, let's consider each of these nodes as the potential center of a 3-star and identify the corresponding leaves.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- This forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- This forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 only has 2 edges, so it cannot be a central node in a 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- This forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

In total, there are 3 unique 3-stars:
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
