Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. We can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 7 meet this criterion. 

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 4)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [5].
