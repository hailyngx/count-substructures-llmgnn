Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all potential 3-stars by checking each node in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7)>
<3, (4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 7)>
<6, (4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (9)>
<9, (8)>

By examining the list above, we can see that there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 7)>
<3, (4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 7)>
<6, (4)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (9)>
