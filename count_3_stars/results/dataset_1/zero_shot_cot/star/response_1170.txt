Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected  
Nodes 0, 3, and 7 have exactly 3 edges connected.

Step 2: Check if these nodes can form 3-stars  
- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9.  
- Node 3 cannot form a 3-star because it does not have three unique neighbors.  
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars

List of unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 8)>
