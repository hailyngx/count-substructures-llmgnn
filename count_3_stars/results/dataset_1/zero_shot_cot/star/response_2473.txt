Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes connected to exactly three leaves. Then we will list the 3-stars they are a part of.

- Node 0 is connected to 3 leaves: 5, 6, 9
- Node 1 is connected to 3 leaves: 3, 7, 9
- Node 3 is connected to 3 leaves: 1, 2, 4
- Node 4 is connected to 3 leaves: 3, 7, 8
- Node 6 is connected to 3 leaves: 0, 3, 9
- Node 7 is connected to 3 leaves: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9 is connected to 3 leaves: 0, 1, 6

Now, we will form unique 3-stars considering these central nodes:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
