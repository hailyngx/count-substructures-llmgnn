Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we can examine each node in the graph to see if it satisfies this condition.

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
