Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, -)>
<3, (6, -, -)>
<4, (8, -, -)>
<5, (1, 6, -)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: 7
