Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7)
6. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5)
8. Node 7: (7, 4)
9. Node 8: (8, 2)
10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 5)>
8. <9, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
