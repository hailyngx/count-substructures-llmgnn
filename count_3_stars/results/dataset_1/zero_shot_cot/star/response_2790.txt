Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 6 is connected to 6 nodes.
- Node 7 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes.

From the above analysis, we see that only Node 6 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming 3-star subgraphs. Therefore, there is only one unique 3-star in the given graph:

<6, (1, 8, 9)>
