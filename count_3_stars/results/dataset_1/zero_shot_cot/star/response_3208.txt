Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node to determine if there are any 3-stars in the graph.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
Node 1 is connected to node 6.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6. <3, (4, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [1]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)>
