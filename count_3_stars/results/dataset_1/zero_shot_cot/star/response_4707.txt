Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 1: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 5, None)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
