Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes but the other two nodes are not directly connected. These sets will represent 3-star structures within the graph.

The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
