Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. For node 0:
    - Nodes connected to node 0: 4, 8
    - <0, (4, 8)>

2. For node 1:
    - Nodes connected to node 1: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
    - <1, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <1, (4, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <1, (6, 7, 8)>

3. For node 3:
    - Nodes connected to node 3: 6, 9
    - <3, (6, 9)>

4. For node 4:
    - Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 1, 5
    - <4, (0, 1, 5)>

5. For node 5:
    - Nodes connected to node 5: 1, 4
    - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
    - <5, (1, 4, 7)>

6. For node 6:
    - Nodes connected to node 6: 1, 3
    - <6, (1, 3, 7)>

7. For node 7:
    - Nodes connected to node 7: 1
    - No 3-star centered at node 7.

8. For node 8:
    - Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 1
    - <8, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <8, (0, 1, 5)>

9. For node 9:
    - Nodes connected to node 9: 3
    - No 3-star centered at node 9.

Count of 3-stars: [11]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>
