Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can focus on finding all such unique structures in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 8), (0, 9)
2. Central node 1: (1, 4), (1, 5)
3. Central node 2: (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9)
4. Central node 3: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8)
5. Central node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8)
6. Central node 5: (5, 1), (5, 7)
7. Central node 7: (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)
8. Central node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4)
9. Central node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 2)>
