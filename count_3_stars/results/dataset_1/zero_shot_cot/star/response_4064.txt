Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. (0, 1, 4, 8)
2. (1, 0, 2, 8)
3. (2, 1, 3, 8)
4. (3, 2, 9)
5. (4, 0, 1, 6)
6. (5, 6, 8, 9)
7. (6, 1, 4, 5)
8. (7, 1, 2, 4)
9. (8, 0, 1, 2)
10. (9, 2, 5)

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
