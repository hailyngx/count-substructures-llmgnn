Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
