Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to find the possible 3-stars that involve node 0 as the central node:
- Node 4 and node 8 are connected to node 0.

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 to find the possible 3-stars that involve node 1 as the central node:
- Node 3, node 5, and node 6 are connected to node 1.

Now, let's determine the possible 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (4, 8)> (Node 0 as the central node with nodes 4 and 8 as leaves)
2. <1, (3, 5, 6)> (Node 1 as the central node with nodes 3, 5, and 6 as leaves)

Finally, we count the number of 3-stars found to obtain the answer: [2].
