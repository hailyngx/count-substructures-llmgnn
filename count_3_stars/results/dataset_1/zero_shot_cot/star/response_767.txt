Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which make up the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

Here are the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 1: Neighbors (4, 5)
- Node 2: Neighbors (3, 7)
- Node 3: Neighbors (2, 7, 8)
- Node 4: Neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9)
- Node 5: Neighbors (1, 9)
- Node 7: Neighbors (0, 2, 3, 8, 9)
- Node 8: Neighbors (3, 4, 7)
- Node 9: Neighbors (4, 5, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore [3].
