Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves based on the definition of a 3-star graph.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will now identify all the 3-stars present.

1. Node 0:
    <0, (3, 4, 7)>
    <0, (3, 7, 8)>
    <0, (3, 7, 9)>
    <0, (4, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1:
    <1, (3, 9, 0)>
    <1, (9, 7, 0)>

3. Node 3:
    <3, (0, 1, 6)>
    <3, (0, 6, 7)>
    <3, (0, 6, 8)>
    <3, (1, 9, 7)>
    <3, (4, 6, 7)>
    <3, (6, 7, 8)>
    <3, (7, 6, 9)>
    <3, (8, 6, 9)>

4. Node 4:
    <4, (0, 7, 9)>

5. Node 6:
    <6, (3, 5, 8)>

6. Node 7:
    <7, (0, 3, 4)>
    <7, (0, 3, 8)>
    <7, (0, 3, 9)>
    <7, (0, 4, 9)>
    <7, (3, 6, 8)>
    <7, (3, 8, 9)>
    <7, (6, 8, 9)>

7. Node 8:
    <8, (0, 3, 6)>
    <8, (0, 3, 7)>
    <8, (0, 6, 7)>
    <8, (3, 6, 7)>
    <8, (6, 7, 9)>

8. Node 9:
    <9, (0, 1, 7)>
    <9, (0, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 9, 0)>, <1, (9, 7, 0)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 9, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (8, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 3)>
