Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 7)>
2. <5, (6, 7, 8)>
3. <6, (5, 8, 7)>
4. <7, (0, 5, 8)>
5. <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
