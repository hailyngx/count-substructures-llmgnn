Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes where one is connected to the other two but the two are not connected directly. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:
   - Node 4 has edges (0, 4), (1, 4), (3, 4), and (9, 4). So, node 4 is a potential center for 3-stars.

2. For each potential center node, identify the pairs of nodes that are connected to the center but not directly connected to each other:
   - For node 4: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 9), (3, 9)

3. For each pair found in step 2, check if there is an edge between them. If not, form a 3-star:
   - 3-star formed with center 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 9, -)>, <4, (1, 3, -)>, <4, (1, 9, -)>, <4, (3, 9, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
