Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, __)>
2. <1, (4, 8, __)>

Count of 3-stars: [2]
