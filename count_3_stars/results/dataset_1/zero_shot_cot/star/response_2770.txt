Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (8, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Now, we need to count the number of unique 3-stars. Let's calculate that:
