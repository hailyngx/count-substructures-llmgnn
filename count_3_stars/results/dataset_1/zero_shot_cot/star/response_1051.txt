Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes and their connections in the graph are:
- 0: 1, 2, 7, 8
- 1: 0, 7, 8
- 2: 0, 3, 5, 8
- 3: 2, 4, 6, 9
- 4: 3, 6, 8, 9
- 5: 2
- 6: 3, 4, 7, 8
- 7: 0, 1, 6
- 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- 9: 3, 4, 8

Next, let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [9].
