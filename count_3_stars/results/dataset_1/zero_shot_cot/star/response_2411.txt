Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, -)>
<2, (8, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, - , -)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [9].
