Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- From node 0: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- From node 2: <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- From node 4: <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- From node 8: <8, (2, 5, 9)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
