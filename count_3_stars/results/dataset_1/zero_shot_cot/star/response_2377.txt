Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
