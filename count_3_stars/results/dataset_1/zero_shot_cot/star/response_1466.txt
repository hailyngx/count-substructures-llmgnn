Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-star structures in the given graph:
1. <0, (2, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (1, 4, 8)>
6. <8, (2, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[6]
