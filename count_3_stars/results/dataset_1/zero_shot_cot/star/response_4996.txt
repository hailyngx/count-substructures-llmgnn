Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
    <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    
2. Node 1:
    <1, (4, 9, )>
    
3. Node 2:
    <2, (0, 4, 6)>
    <2, (4, 6, 9)>
    
4. Node 3:
    <3, (0, 5, 8)>
    
5. Node 4:
    <4, (1, 2, )>
    
6. Node 6:
    <6, (0, 2, )>
    
7. Node 9:
    <9, (1, 2, )>

So, there are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
