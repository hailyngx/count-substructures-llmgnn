Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first calculate the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.

To form a 3-star graph, we need a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify such structures in the given graph:

1. Central node 0:
    <0, (1, 3, 6)>
    <0, (1, 7, 8)>
    <0, (3, 6, 8)>
    <0, (6, 7, 8)>
    (Total: 4)

2. Central node 1:
    <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    (Total: 1)

3. Central node 2:
    <2, (4, 7, 9)>
    (Total: 1)

4. Central node 3:
    <3, (0, 8, 9)>
    (Total: 1)

5. Central node 4:
    <4, (2, 6, 7)>
    (Total: 1)

6. Central node 6:
    <6, (0, 1, 4)>
    <6, (0, 4, 8)>
    <6, (1, 4, 8)>
    <6, (4, 7, 8)>
    (Total: 4)

7. Central node 7:
    <7, (0, 2, 5)>
    <7, (0, 5, 8)>
    <7, (2, 4, 5)>
    <7, (4, 6, 8)>
    (Total: 4)

8. Central node 8:
    <8, (0, 3, 6)>
    <8, (0, 6, 7)>
    <8, (3, 6, 9)>
    <8, (6, 7, 9)>
    (Total: 4)

9. Central node 9:
    <9, (2, 3, 8)>
    (Total: 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is: [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [21].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
