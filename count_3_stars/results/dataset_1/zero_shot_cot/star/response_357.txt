Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
In this graph, nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9 are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

Step 2: For each potential center node, identify the nodes that are connected to it.
   - For node 0: Nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to node 0.
   - For node 5: Nodes 1, 4, and 8 are connected to node 5.
   - For node 7: Nodes 0, 6, 8, and 9 are connected to node 7.
   - For node 9: Nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are connected to node 9.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars that can be formed.
In this graph, there are 3 possible 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <5, (1, 4, 8)>
3. <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
