Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (3, 4, 1)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 2)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (0, 6, 3)>
<9, (3)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
