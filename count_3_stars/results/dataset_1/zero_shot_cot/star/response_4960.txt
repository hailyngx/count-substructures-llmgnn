Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we can go through the following steps:
1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each identified central node, check if it is connected to exactly three leaves.
3. Count the unique 3-stars that are formed in the graph.

Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, and Node 9 are all connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each of these central nodes, check if they are connected to exactly three leaves:
- For Node 2:
  - Leaves connected to Node 2: 3, 5, 9
  - Possible 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 9)>
  
- For Node 3:
  - Leaves connected to Node 3: 2, 4, 7
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 7)>
  
- For Node 5:
  - Leaves connected to Node 5: 1, 2, 9
  - Possible 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 9)>
  
- For Node 9:
  - Leaves connected to Node 9: 2, 5, 8
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (2, 5, 8)>

3. Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <<2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>].
