Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances represent 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with three connections are as follows:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 9, and 0
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 1

Now we list the unique 3-stars below:
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<7, (4, 5, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
