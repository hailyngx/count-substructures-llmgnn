Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Given the edge list, we can determine the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three edges. The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 0)>
- <1, (0, 7, 4)>
- <2, (8, 9, 2)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
