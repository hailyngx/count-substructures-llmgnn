Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's first list all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, which can potentially be the center node of a 3-star:
- Node 3 has 4 edges (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7)
- Node 5 has 5 edges (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8)
- Node 7 has 4 edges (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (9, 1)

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
