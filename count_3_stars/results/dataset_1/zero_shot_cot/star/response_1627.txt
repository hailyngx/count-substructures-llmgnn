Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node of each potential 3-star by counting the degree of each node since a 3-star has a center node with degree exactly 3. Then we will find the leaves connected to the center node.

From the given edges, the degree of each node is as follows:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1

Considering only nodes with a degree of 3, we can find the 3-stars. 

As there are multiple 3-stars in this graph, we will list them below:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
