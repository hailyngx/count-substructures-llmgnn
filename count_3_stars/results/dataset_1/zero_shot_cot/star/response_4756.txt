Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly three incident edges will be the central nodes. In this case, node 0 is the central node. 

Now, let's identify the sets of leaves connected to the central node (node 0). We can do this by looking at the neighbors of node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}. We need to find sets of exactly three leaves connected to node 0.

The sets of leaves connected to node 0 are: {(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 8), (2, 3, 0), (6, 0, 4), (9, 0, 4)}.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 0)>, <0, (6, 0, 4)>, <0, (9, 0, 4)>
