Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected nodes:
- Central Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Central Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
- Central Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9.
- Central Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Central Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Central Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Central Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Central Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Central Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7.
- Central Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Central Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves (3, 6, 9) <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- Central Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 4, 5) <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Central Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 2, 3) <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- Central Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves (5, 7, 8) <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- Central Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves (1, 2, 4) <9, (1, 2, 4)>
- Central Node 9 forms another 3-star with leaves (6, 7, 9) <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>.
