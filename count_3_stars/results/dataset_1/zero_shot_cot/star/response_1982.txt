Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Central nodes are the nodes with exactly three neighbors.
In this graph, nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8 are central nodes.

Step 2: For each central node, identify its neighboring nodes to form 3-stars.
Let's go through each central node:
1. For central node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 5), (0, 5, 7)
2. For central node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 2, 5)
3. For central node 4: (4, 0, 8), (4, 8, 9)
4. For central node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 2, 3), (5, 3, 9)
5. For central node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 4, 7)

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once.
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (3, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)> 

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
