Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Now let's count the number of unique 3-star graphs inside brackets []:
