Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to node 3.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.

7. Node 6 is connected to node 7.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.

10. Node 9 is connected to node 4.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
