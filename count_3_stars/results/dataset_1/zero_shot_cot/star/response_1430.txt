Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes (3, 4, and 5), it forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 5)>.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes (3, 6, and 7), it forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 7)>.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 2, and 6), it forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 6)> and <3, (0, 2, 7)>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 5 is connected to node 0. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes (2, 3, and 8), it forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 3, 8)>.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes (0, 2, and 3), it forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 2, 3)>.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 6. Since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, and <6, (2, 3, 8)>.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
