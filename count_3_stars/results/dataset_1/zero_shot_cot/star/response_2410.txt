Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (6, 9, -)>
<2, (5, 7, -)>
<3, (6, -, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
