Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to see if there are any 3-stars centered at node 0:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8 are connected to Node 0.

Now, let's check for each node that is connected to Node 0 if it forms a 3-star:
1. Node 1: (0, 1, 4) forms a 3-star centered at Node 0.
2. Node 3: (0, 3, 9) forms a 3-star centered at Node 0.
3. Node 4: (0, 4, 6) forms a 3-star centered at Node 0.
4. Node 6: (0, 6, 2) forms a 3-star centered at Node 0.
5. Node 8: (0, 8, 7) forms a 3-star centered at Node 0.

So, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (6, 2, 0)>
<0, (8, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
