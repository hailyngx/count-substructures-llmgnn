Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
