Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors (degree equals 3), as these can potentially be centers of 3-stars.
2. Check if the neighbors of these nodes form a 3-star pattern around them.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has degree 4: (4, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 1 has degree 1: (5)
- Node 2 has degree 2: (5, 7)
- Node 3 has degree 4: (4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 4 has degree 4: (0, 3, 5, 7)
- Node 5 has degree 4: (0, 1, 2, 4)
- Node 6 has degree 3: (0, 8, 9) [Potential center]
- Node 7 has degree 5: (0, 2, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 8 has degree 2: (3, 6)
- Node 9 has degree 4: (3, 6, 7)

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
