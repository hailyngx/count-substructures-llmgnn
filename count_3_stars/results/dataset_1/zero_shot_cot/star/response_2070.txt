Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 1, 3, 9
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 0, 6
3. Central node: 2, Leaves: 3
4. Central node: 3, Leaves: 0, 2, 5
5. Central node: 4, Leaves: 5, 6, 7, 9
6. Central node: 5, Leaves: 3, 4
7. Central node: 6, Leaves: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
8. Central node: 7, Leaves: 4, 6, 8, 9
9. Central node: 8, Leaves: 7, 9
10. Central node: 9, Leaves: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10], which are represented as:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 6)>
<2, (3)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 4, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6, 7, 8)>
