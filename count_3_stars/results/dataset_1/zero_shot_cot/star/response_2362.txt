Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. 
Nodes with 3 edges are the central nodes. From the given edges, nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have 3 edges each, so they can be the central nodes of potential 3-stars. 

Next, let's identify the leaves of the 3-stars connected to each central node. 
- For central node 0: leaves are 1, 6, and 9
- For central node 3: leaves are 2, 4, and 6
- For central node 4: leaves are 1, 3, and 9
- For central node 5: leaves are 2, 3, and 6
- For central node 9: leaves are 0, 4, and 7

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
