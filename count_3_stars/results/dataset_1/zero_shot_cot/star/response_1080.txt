Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The center node and its adjacent nodes form a 3-star. Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].  
<2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
