Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Given the definition of a 3-star, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edge list, we can derive the following 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 9)>
<6, (0)>
<8, (0)>
<9, (4, 5)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are 9 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
