Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Given the edges provided, let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars. 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Potential 3-stars with central nodes:
- Node 2: (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 9), (6, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Count of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (7, 9)>
<3, (4, 6)>
<6, (3, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
