Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
    - Node 0 has 2 edges
    - Node 1 has 2 edges
    - Node 2 has 3 edges
    - Node 3 has 2 edges
    - Node 4 has 4 edges
    - Node 5 has 2 edges
    - Node 6 has 1 edge
    - Node 7 has 4 edges
    - Node 8 has 3 edges
    - Node 9 has 4 edges

Step 2: List the 3-stars in the graph.
    <2, (4, 8, 9)>
    <4, (1, 2, 9)>
    <9, (2, 4, 5)>
    <4, (2, 7, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
