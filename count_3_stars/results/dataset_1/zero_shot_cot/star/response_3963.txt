Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 has 5 edges, forming the 3-stars <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, and <0, (2, 6, 9)>.
- Node 1 has 5 edges, forming the 3-stars <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, and <1, (3, 7, 8)>.
- Node 2 has 5 edges, forming the 3-stars <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, and <2, (4, 8, 9)>.
- Node 4 has 5 edges, forming the 3-stars <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 8, 6)>, and <4, (2, 6, 8)>.
- Node 8 has 5 edges, forming the 3-stars <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, and <8, (2, 6, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
