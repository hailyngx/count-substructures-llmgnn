Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

We will first identify all the nodes which have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the center of the 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 3, 6, and 7.

Now, for each of these nodes, we will find the three other nodes that are connected to them to form a 3-star.

For node 3:
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 6:
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>

For node 7:
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9.
