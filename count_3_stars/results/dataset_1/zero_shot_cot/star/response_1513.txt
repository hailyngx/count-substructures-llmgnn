Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
    
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 9
   - Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8
   - Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 5
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 3
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, 9
   - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 8

Therefore, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5)>
<1, (3, 9)>
<2, (5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
