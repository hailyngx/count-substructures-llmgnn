Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is directly connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can see that the central node of a 3-star will have 3 edges emanating from it. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<5, (8, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
