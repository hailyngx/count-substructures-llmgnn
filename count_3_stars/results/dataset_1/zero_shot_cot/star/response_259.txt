Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible occurrences of 3-stars.

Given the edges provided, we look for nodes that are connected in a 3-star configuration. Each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star shape.

Let's identify the 3-stars based on the given edges:

1. 3-stars:
   - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (0, 8, 6)>
   - <2, (3)>
   - <3, (2)>
   - <4, (6)>
   - <5, (7)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <7, (5)>
   - <8, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
