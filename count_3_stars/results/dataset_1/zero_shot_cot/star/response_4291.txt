Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3) and list them as the leaves of the 3-stars. 
From the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.

Thus, the 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (7, 9)>
<1, (5, 6)>
<2,(5, 8)>
<3, (6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
