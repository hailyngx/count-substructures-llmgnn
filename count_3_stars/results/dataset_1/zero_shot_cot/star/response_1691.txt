Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three neighbors by edges. 

In the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 1)>
<5, (2, 6, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (7, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 
   
<0, (2, 4, 5)> <1, (4, 7, 7)> <2, (0, 5, 6)> <4, (0, 1, 1)> <5, (2, 6, 6)> <6, (5, 7, 7)> <7, (1, 6, 9)> <9, (7, 7, 0)>
