Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [7].
