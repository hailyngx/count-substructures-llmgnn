Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edge list:
(0, 6) (0, 9) 
(1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) 
(2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) 
(3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) 
(4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) 
(5, 2) (5, 7) 
(6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) 
(7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) 
(8, 2) (8, 4) 
(9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
2. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
3. <4, (3, 7, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <7, (1, 4, 5)>
6. <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [(6)].
