Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We will then form 3-stars using these nodes where one node will be the central node and the other three nodes will be the leaves connected to the central node.

Following are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
