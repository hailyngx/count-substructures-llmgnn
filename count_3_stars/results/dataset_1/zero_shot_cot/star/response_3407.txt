Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We can then list these 3-stars and count them.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8. Since nodes 2, 3, and 4 are connected to node 1, we have a 3-star with node 1 as the center and leaves as nodes 2, 3, and 4. <1, (2, 3, 4)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. Since nodes 1 and 4 are connected to node 2, we have a 3-star with node 2 as the center and leaves as nodes 1, 4, and 9. <2, (1, 4, 9)>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. Since nodes 1 and 4 are connected to node 3, we have a 3-star with node 3 as the center and leaves as nodes 1, 4, and 5. <3, (1, 4, 5)>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8. Since nodes 1, 2, and 3 are connected to node 4, we have already counted these 3-stars in the above steps.

5. Nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not form 3-stars as they are each connected to fewer than three other nodes.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, and <3, (1, 4, 5)>.
