Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes and their corresponding neighbors based on the given edges:
Node 0 : 3
Node 1 : 2, 4
Node 2 : 1
Node 3 : 0, 4, 5
Node 4 : 1, 3, 8
Node 5 : 3
Node 6 : 9
Node 8 : 4
Node 9 : 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (3)>
<6, (9)>
<8, (4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
