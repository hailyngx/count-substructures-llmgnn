Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 4)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (4, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <5, (2, 3, 4)>
7. <6, (1, 9, 7)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 3)>
9. <8, (3, 4, 5)>
10. <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the output is [10].
