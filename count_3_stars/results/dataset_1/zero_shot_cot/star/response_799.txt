Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
