Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, here are the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 4)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 7, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
