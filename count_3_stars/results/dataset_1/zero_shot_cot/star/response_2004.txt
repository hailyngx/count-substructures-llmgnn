Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Here are the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9
  - 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
  - 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6
  - 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
  - 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9
  - 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
