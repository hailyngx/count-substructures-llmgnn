Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes and form a star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1: (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 6), (1, 4, 8)
2. Node 2: (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 8)
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 5)
4. Node 4: (4, 1, 8)
5. Node 5: (5, 3, 9)
6. Node 6: (6, 1, 7)
7. Node 8: (8, 1, 9)
8. Node 9: (9, 0, 4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

<1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 9, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <8, (1, 9, 4)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>
