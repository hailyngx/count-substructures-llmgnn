Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9  
Node 1: 0, 2, 8  
Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Node 3: 0, 6, 9  
Node 4: 5  
Node 5: 4  
Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9  
Node 7: 2, 6  
Node 8: 0, 1, 2  
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Count of 3-stars: [5]

<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
