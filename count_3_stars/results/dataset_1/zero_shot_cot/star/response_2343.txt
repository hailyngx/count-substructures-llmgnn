Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars. 

Given the definition of a 3-star, we need to look for nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the nodes in the graph that have three connections:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 5, 6)

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
