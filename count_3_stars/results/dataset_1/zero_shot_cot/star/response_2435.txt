Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 9, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 6)>
<4, (0, 0, 6)>
<5, (1, 1, 0)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (9, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 9, 8)>

Number of 3-stars: 10
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
