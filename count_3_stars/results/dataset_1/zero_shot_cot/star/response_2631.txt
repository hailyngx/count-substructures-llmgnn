Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (4, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 3)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 3, 5)>
10. <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
