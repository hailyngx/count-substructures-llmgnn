Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the 3-stars and then counting them.

<0, (3, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, -)>
<3, (0, 2, -)>
<4, (1, 5, -)>
<5, (2, 9, 4)>
<6, (1, 7, -)>
<7, (6, -, -)>
<9, (0, 5, -)>

There are a total of [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
