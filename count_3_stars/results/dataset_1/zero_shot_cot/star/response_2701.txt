Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Starting with each node as the potential center:
- Node 0 has neighbors 2, 3, 5, and 6. Since it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, it can form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has neighbors 2 and 9. It cannot form a 3-star because it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, it can form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors 0 and 9. It cannot form a 3-star because it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 4 has neighbors 6, 7, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, it can form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 2, and 9. Since it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, it can form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbors 0 and 4. It cannot form a 3-star because it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 4, and 8. Since it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, it can form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors 2 and 7. It cannot form a 3-star because it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
- Node 9 has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, it can form a 3-star.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
