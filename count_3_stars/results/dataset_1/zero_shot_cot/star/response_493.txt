Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms 1 three-star: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms 3 three-stars: <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>
3. Node 3 forms 1 three-star: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
4. Node 4 forms 3 three-stars: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (3, 8, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>
5. Node 5 forms 1 three-star: <5, (0, 4, 1)>
6. Node 6 forms 1 three-star: <6, (3, 9, 3)>
7. Node 7 forms 1 three-star: <7, (1, 8, 1)>
8. Node 8 forms 2 three-stars: <8, (1, 4, 3)>, <8, (1, 7, 4)>
9. Node 9 forms 1 three-star: <9, (3, 6, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of 14 3-stars in the given graph.
