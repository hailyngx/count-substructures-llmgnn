Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 1, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 2, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <3, (1, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (6, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 9, 2)>
7. <6, (4, 7, -)>
8. <7, (3, 9, 4)>
9. <8, (3, 9, -)>
10. <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph.
