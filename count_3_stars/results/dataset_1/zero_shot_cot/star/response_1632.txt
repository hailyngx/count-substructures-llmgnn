Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their corresponding edges to visualize the connections between nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

Next, let's find the 3-star configurations in this graph. Counting the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (1, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (6, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (7, 3)>
6. <5, (0, 1)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 2)>
8. <7, (4, 3)>
9. <8, (0, 2, 3)>
10. <9, (0, 2)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-star configurations in this graph.  
So, the output is [10].
