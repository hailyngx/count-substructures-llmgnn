Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible instances of 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

[5]
