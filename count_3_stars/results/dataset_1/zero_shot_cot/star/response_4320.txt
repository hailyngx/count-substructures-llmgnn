Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>

2. For node 1:
- No 3-stars attached to node 1.

3. For node 2:
- No 3-stars attached to node 2.

4. For node 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (4, 0, 5)>

5. For node 4:
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (3, 0, 5)>

6. For node 5:
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (3, 0, 4)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (8, 6, 9)>
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>

7. For node 6:
- No 3-stars attached to node 6.

8. For node 7:
- No 3-stars attached to node 7.

9. For node 8:
- No 3-stars attached to node 8.

10. For node 9:
- No 3-stars attached to node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 0, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 0, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 0, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 6, 9)>.
