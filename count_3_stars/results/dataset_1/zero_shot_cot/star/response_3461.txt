Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, these are potential centers of 3-stars.  
Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7

Step 2: For each potential center node, check if its neighbors form a 3-star.  
For node 3: (3, 4, 5), (3, 5, 9), (3, 4, 6)  
For node 5: (5, 3, 9)  
For node 7: (7, 4, 6), (7, 6, 8)  

Output the final answer inside brackets []: [2]  
List the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once:   
<3, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>
