Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4, forming a 3-star <2, (0, 1, 4)>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star <3, (0, 5, 7)>.

Next, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
