Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step. 

Step 1: Identify the central node and its adjacent nodes.
From the given edges, we can see that node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8), node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6), and node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7, 8).

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars for each central node.
- Node 1: (2, 6, 7), (2, 6, 8), (2, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 5, 6)
- Node 9: (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 8), (0, 7, 8)

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars.
<1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>
