Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list them out:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [14].
