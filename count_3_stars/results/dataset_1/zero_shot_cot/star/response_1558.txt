Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The final answer is [5].
