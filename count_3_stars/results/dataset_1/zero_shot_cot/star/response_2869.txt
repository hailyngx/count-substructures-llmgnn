Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 8, 2)>
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
