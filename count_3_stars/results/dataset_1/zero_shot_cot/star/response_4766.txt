Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to three leaf nodes, we will look for patterns that match this structure.

Let's analyze the given graph by looking at each node and its incident edges:

- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2)
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6)
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3)
- Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 7)

From the analysis above, we can identify the following 3-star patterns:
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Here are the unique 3-star patterns found:
- <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- <3, (5, 7, 9)>
