Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
