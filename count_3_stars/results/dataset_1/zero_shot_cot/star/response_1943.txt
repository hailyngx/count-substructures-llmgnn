Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 4, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
In a 3-star, there are 4 nodes involved: 1 center node and 3 leaf nodes.

Counting individual 3-stars:
- From the above connections, we can see that there is only 1 potential 3-star present:
    <3, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <3, (0, 1, 4)>.
