Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. First, we need to identify the central node of each potential 3-star. A central node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Next, for each central node, we check if it is connected to exactly three nodes, and if those three nodes are not directly connected to each other. If this condition is met, we have found a 3-star.

3. Finally, we list the unique 3-stars found.

Given the edges provided, we have the following 3-stars:
- Central Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- Central Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Central Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Central Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- Central Node 4: <4, (3, 7, -)>
- Central Node 5: <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- Central Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 5)>
- Central Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- Central Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 7, -)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>.
