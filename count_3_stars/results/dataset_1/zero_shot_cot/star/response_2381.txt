Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The central node of a 3-star can be any node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list all the possible 3-stars with their central node and connecting nodes:

<0, (2, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
