Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique groups of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star with center node 0: <0, (3, 4, 9)>
2. 3-star with center node 2: <2, (5, 8, 9)>
3. 3-star with center node 3: <3, (0, 9, 4)>
4. 3-star with center node 4: <4, (0, 9, 3)>
5. 3-star with center node 5: <5, (2, 8, 9)>
6. 3-star with center node 8: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
7. 3-star with center node 9: <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (8, 5, 2)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [7].
