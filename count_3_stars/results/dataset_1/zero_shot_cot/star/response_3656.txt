Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars based on the given graph:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 9, x)> (Note: The third branch can't be determined from the given edges)
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
