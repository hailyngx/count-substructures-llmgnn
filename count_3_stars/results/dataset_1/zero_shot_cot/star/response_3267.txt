Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the central node can be any node with exactly three connected nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (1, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<5, (9, 8, 7)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
