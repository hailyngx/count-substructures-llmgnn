Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes  
Central nodes have exactly three edges connected to them. From the given graph, the central nodes are 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5.  

Step 2: Find the leaves connected to each central node  
- For node 0: (1, 2, 4, 7)  
- For node 1: (0, 2, 9)  
- For node 2: (0, 1, 4, 5)  
- For node 4: (0, 2, 5)  
- For node 5: (2, 4, 7, 8, 9)  

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars  
By combining the central nodes with their connected leaves, we can form unique 3-stars. Counting these, we find that there are <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, and <5, (2, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
