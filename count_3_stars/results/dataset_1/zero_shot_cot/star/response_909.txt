Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (3, 8, 0)>
<1, (7, 8, 1)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 2)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (2, 7, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
