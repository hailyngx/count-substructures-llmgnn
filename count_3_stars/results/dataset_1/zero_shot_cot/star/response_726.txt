Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 9 are connected to three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 8, 10)>
<9, (3, 0, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [5].
