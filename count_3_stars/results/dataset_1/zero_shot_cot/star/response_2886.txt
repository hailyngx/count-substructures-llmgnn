Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. From the edges given, we can see that the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 9, 0)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 2)>
- <9, (4, 6, 0)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [7].
