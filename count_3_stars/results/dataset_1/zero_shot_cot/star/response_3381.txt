Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, which form a 3-star pattern around that node.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes 0 and 8 have 2 edges each, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star.
2. Nodes 3 and 9 have 3 edges each. Let's check if they form 3-stars:
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9. So, we have a 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (4, 5, 9)>
    - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 2. It does not form a 3-star since node 2 is repeated.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <3, (4, 5, 9)>.
