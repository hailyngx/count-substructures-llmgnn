Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by finding all the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 1 forms 3-star with nodes 6, 8, 7: <1, (6, 8, 7)>
2. Node 2 forms 3-star with nodes 3, 8, 0: <2, (3, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
