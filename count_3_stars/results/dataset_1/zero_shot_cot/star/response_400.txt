Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

By observing the provided edge list, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (6, 9, 1)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 0)>
3. <2, (3, 9, 5)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 6)>
6. <5, (8, 9, 2)>
7. <6, (0, 4, 1)>
8. <7, (4, 6, 9)>
9. <8, (3, 5, 4)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
