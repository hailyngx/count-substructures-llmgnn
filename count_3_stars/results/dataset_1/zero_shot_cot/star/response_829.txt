Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the degrees of each node to find the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 1
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 1

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

- <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [4].
