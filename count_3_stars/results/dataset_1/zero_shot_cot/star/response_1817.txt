Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

The number of 3-stars can be counted by finding all the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars.

From the given information, we find that the central nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are nodes 2, 5, and 8. 

Now, let's list the 3-stars using these central nodes:

<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found 3 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [3].
