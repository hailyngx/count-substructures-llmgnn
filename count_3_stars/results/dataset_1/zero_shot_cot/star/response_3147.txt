Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: no 3-stars
- Node 1: <1, (4, 6, 2)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 1)>
- Node 3: no 3-stars
- Node 4: <4, (1, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>
- Node 5: no 3-stars
- Node 6: no 3-stars
- Node 8: <8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Finally, the number of 3-stars is [5].
