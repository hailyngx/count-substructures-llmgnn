Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph: 

1. <0, (1, 4, 1)>
2. <1, (0, 9, 9)>
3. <2, (8, 8, -)>
4. <3, (9, 9, -)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
6. <5, (4, 7, -)>
7. <6, (4, - , -)>
8. <7, (5, - , -)>
9. <8, (2, - , -)>
10. <9, (1, 3, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get 10 such instances. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
