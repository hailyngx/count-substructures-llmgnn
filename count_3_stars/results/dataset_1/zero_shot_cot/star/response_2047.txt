Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 6, 9
   <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to node 5
   <1, (5, 2, 3)>

3. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 3, 5, 7
   <2, (3, 5, 7)>

4. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 5, 6
   <3, (2, 5, 8)>
   <3, (2, 5, 4)>

5. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 9
   <4, (0, 5, 7)>
   <4, (0, 5, 9)>

6. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
   <5, (1, 2, 3)>
   <5, (1, 2, 7)>

7. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 3, 7
   <6, (0, 3, 7)>

8. Node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
   (7, 2, 3)
   <7, (2, 3, 5)>

9. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 3, 5
   <8, (3, 5, 1)>

10. Node 9:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 4
   <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
