Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 3)>
<3, (7, 8, 2)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 4)>
<7, (3, 9, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 3)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
