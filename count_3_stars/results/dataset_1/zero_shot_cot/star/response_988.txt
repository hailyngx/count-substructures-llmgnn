Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: Not a 3-star since it has only two neighbors (nodes 5 and 9).
2. Node 1: Not a 3-star since it has three neighbors (nodes 3, 6, and 7).
3. Node 2: Not a 3-star since it has three neighbors (nodes 3, 4, and 8).
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
5. Node 4: Not a 3-star since it has four neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7).
6. Node 5: Not a 3-star since it has only one neighbor (node 0).
7. Node 6: <6, (1, 4, 7)>
8. Node 7: Not a 3-star since it has three neighbors (nodes 1, 4, and 6).
9. Node 8: Not a 3-star since it has only one neighbor (node 2).
10. Node 9: Not a 3-star since it has three neighbors (nodes 0, 4, and 6).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] and the unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 2, 4)> and <6, (1, 4, 7)>.
