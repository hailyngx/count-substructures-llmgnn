Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star structure present. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<1, (3, 9, -)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, -)>
<6, (0, 2, -)>
<7, (3, 5, -)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, -, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
