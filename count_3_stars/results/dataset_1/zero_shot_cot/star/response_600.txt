Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Central node 0:
   - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (7, 8, 2)>

2. Central node 1:
   - <1, (5, 8, 9)>

3. Central node 2:
   - <2, (0, 8, 9)>

4. Central node 3: None (as it is connected to only one other node, 8).

5. Central node 4:
   - <4, (5, 9, 9)>

6. Central node 5:
   - <5, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (4, 6, 9)>
   - <5, (6, 9, 1)>

7. Central node 6: None (as it is connected to only one other node, 5).

8. Central node 7:
   - <7, (0, 8, 2)>

9. Central node 8:
   - <8, (0, 1, 9)>
   - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <8, (3, 9, 1)>
   - <8, (9, 0, 1)>
   - <8, (9, 1, 3)>

10. Central node 9:
    - <9, (1, 2, 4)>
    - <9, (2, 4, 5)>
    - <9, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <9, (5, 1, 4)>
    - <9, (5, 8, 4)>
    - <9, (8, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
