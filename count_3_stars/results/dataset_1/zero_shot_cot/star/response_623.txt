Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
