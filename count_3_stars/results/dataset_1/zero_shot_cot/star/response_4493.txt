Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graph in the given graph:

1. 3-star with center node 0: (0, 1, 6, 8)
2. 3-star with center node 1: (1, 0, 4, 5)
3. 3-star with center node 4: (4, 1, 2, 3)
4. 3-star with center node 6: (6, 0, 4, 8)
5. 3-star with center node 7: (7, 2, 4, 5)
6. 3-star with center node 8: (8, 0, 3, 6)
7. 3-star with center node 9: (9, 0, 1, 4)

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [7]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
