Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
Based on the given edges, the central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For central node 0: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- For central node 1: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- For central node 2: <2, (1, 3, 6)> and <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- For central node 3: <3, (2, 4, 9)>
- For central node 4: <4, (3, 8, 9)>
- For central node 6: <6, (1, 2, 0)>
- For central node 7: <7, (0, 9, 0)>
- For central node 8: <8, (4, 9, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
