Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can analyze each node's connections to see if they form a 3-star.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
  <0, (3, 7, 8)> 

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2 and 5.
  (This node cannot be part of a 3-star as it only has 2 connections.)

- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1 and 4.
  (This node cannot be part of a 3-star as it only has 2 connections.)

- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
  <3, (0, 7, 8)>
  <3, (0, 7, 9)>

- Node 4: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
  <4, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
  (This node cannot be part of a 3-star as it only has 3 connections.)

- Node 6: Connected to node 4.
  (This node cannot be part of a 3-star as it only has 1 connection.)

- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0 and 3.
  (This node cannot be part of a 3-star as it only has 2 connections.)

- Node 8: Connected to node 0 and 3.
  (This node cannot be part of a 3-star as it only has 2 connections.)

- Node 9: Connected to node 3.
  (This node cannot be part of a 3-star as it only has 1 connection.)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>

Since we have found 4 unique 3-stars, the final count is [4].
