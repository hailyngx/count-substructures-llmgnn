Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph can be identified as follows:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, -)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
