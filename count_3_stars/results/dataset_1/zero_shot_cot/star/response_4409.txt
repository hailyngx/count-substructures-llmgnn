Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 8, 1)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 2)>
<6, (3, 9, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
