Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.

From the connections above, we can see that there are two 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. <9, (4, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
