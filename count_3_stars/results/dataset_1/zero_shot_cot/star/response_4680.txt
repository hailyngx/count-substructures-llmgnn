Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes in the graph based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 2 3-stars: <3, (2, 6, 8)> and <3, (6, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<0, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>
