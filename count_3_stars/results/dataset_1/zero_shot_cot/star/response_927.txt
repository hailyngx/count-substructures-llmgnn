Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

We can follow these steps:
1. Identify the nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., the central node of a 3-star).
2. For each node meeting the criteria in step 1, identify the three nodes that are connected to it by an edge.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0, with neighbors: 1, 4, 7
- Node 1, with neighbors: 0, 4
- Node 4, with neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9, with neighbors: 4, 5, 8

2. Unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
