Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to node 0 since node 0 will be the central node of the 3-stars. The nodes connected to node 0 are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. 

Now, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 leaves connected to node 0. These combinations are: (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 6), (1, 6, 7), (3, 5, 6), (3, 5, 0), (5, 6, 0), and (6, 0, 7). We will confirm each of these combinations.

Now, let's verify each combination to see if they form a 3-star in the given graph:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)> - This forms a 3-star.
- <0, (1, 5, 6)> - This does not form a 3-star as node 6 is not directly connected to node 0.
- <0, (1, 6, 7)> - This does not form a 3-star as node 7 is not directly connected to node 0.
- <0, (3, 5, 6)> - This forms a 3-star.
- <0, (3, 5, 0)> - This does not form a 3-star as node 0 is the center node.
- <0, (5, 6, 0)> - This does not form a 3-star as node 5 is already a leaf of another 3-star.
- <0, (6, 0, 7)> - This does not form a 3-star as nodes 0 and 7 are not directly connected.

Based on the verification, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <0, (1, 3, 5)> and <0, (3, 5, 6)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
