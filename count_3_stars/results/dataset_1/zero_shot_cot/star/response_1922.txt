Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to node 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to node 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 1, 0)>
<2, (4, 2, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 6, 8)>
<2, (8, 5, 7)>
<2, (8, 5, 9)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 3, 0)>
<4, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 8, 5)>
<8, (2, 8, 7)>
<8, (2, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 9, 6)>
<9, (9, 0, 6)>

Hence, there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
