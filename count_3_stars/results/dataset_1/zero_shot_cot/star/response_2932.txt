Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by first identifying all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (leaves connected to each node):
    - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 9
    - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
    - Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
    - Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
    - Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4
    - Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
    - Total 3-stars = 6 (one for each identified center node)

Output: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>
