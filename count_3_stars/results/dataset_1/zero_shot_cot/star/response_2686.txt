Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, since these will be our potential center nodes for the 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Now, let's go through these potential center nodes one by one to see if they can form 3-stars. 

For each potential center node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star. If yes, we will identify the leaves of the star.

Let's start with the node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 5. 
- Out of these neighbors, only nodes 1, 4, 5 form a 3-star with node 0. <0, (1, 4, 5)>

Moving on to the next potential center node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8, 9.
- Out of these neighbors, nodes 2, 5, 8 form a 3-star with node 3. <3, (2, 5, 8)>

Next, let's consider the node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 9.
- Out of these neighbors, nodes 0, 6, 9 form a 3-star with node 4. <4, (0, 6, 9)>

Moving on to the node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8.
- Out of these neighbors, only nodes 0, 3, 6 form a 3-star with node 5. <5, (0, 3, 6)>

Next, let's consider the node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 9.
- Out of these neighbors, only nodes 4, 5, 9 form a 3-star with node 6. <6, (4, 5, 9)>

Moving on to the node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Out of these neighbors, only nodes 1, 2, 3 form a 3-star with node 0. <8, (1, 2, 3)>

Lastly, let's consider the node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6.
- Out of these neighbors, only nodes 3, 4, 6 form a 3-star with node 9. <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
