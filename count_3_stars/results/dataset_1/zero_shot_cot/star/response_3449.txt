Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-star configurations in the graph. 
- Nodes 1, 4, and 6 have degree 4
- Nodes 0, 2, and 3 have degree 2
- Nodes 5 and 8 have degree 5
- Nodes 7 and 9 have degree 3

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.
[<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (7, 9, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>]
[<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (7, 9, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>] 

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
