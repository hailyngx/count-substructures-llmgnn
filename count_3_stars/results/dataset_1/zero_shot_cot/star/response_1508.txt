Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
