Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like manner.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 9, 1)>
<1, (8, 9, 0)>
<2, (5, 7, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
