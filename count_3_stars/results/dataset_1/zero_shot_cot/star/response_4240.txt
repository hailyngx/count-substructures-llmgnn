Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <0, (7, 9, 2)>
3. <1, (0, 3, 7)>
4. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
5. <3, (1, 7, -)>
6. <4, (6, 7, -)>
7. <5, (2, 9, -)>
8. <6, (4, 7, -)>
9. <7, (0, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

So, we have found 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
