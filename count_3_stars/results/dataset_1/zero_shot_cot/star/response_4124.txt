Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 since each 3-star consists of a central node with degree 3. The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are: 0, 1, 4, and 5. 

Now, let's find all possible 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
