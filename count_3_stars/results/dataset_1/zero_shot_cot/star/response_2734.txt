Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly three incident edges are potential central nodes of 3-stars. In this case, nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 are potential central nodes.

Now, let's check each potential central node and see if they are connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, we have a 3-star.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5. (1 extra connection)
Therefore, node 0 is not the center of any 3-star.

Moving on to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8. (2 extra connections)
Therefore, node 2 is not the center of any 3-star.

Node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
<3, (0, 5, 8)>

Moving on to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
<4, (2, 5, 8)>

Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
<5, (0, 2, 3)> and <5, (0, 2, 4)>

Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.
Therefore, node 8 is not the center of any 3-star.

So, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<3, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, and <5, (0, 2, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
