Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern present. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Now we can count the number of unique 3-stars: [7].
