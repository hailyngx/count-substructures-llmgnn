Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
