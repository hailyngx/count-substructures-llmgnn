Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9, forming 3-stars with leaves {2, 3, 4} and {2, 6, 9}. Count: 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7, forming a 3-star with leaves {0, 5, 7}. Count: 1
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9, forming 3-stars with leaves {0, 4, 5} and {4, 5, 9}. Count: 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, forming a 3-star with leaves {0, 3, 5}. Count: 1
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8, forming a 3-star with leaves {2, 3, 4}. Count: 1
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9, forming a 3-star with leaves {2, 8, 9}. Count: 1

Count of 3-stars: [8]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
