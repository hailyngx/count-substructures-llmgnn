Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars by following the definition provided. Remember that for a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by listing the unique ones:
