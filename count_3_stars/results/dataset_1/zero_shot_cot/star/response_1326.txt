Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it with exactly three edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
