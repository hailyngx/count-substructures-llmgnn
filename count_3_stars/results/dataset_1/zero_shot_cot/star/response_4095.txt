Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1:
    - <1, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
    - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
    - <1, (7, 8, 9)>

2. Node 2:
    - <2, (1, 3, 9)>

3. Node 3:
    - <3, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <3, (1, 9, 5)>

4. Node 7:
    - <7, (1, 5, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (5, 8, 9)>
    - <7, (1, 6, 8)>

5. Node 8:
    - <8, (1, 4, 7)>
    - <8, (1, 7, 9)>
    - <8, (1, 9, 7)>
    - <8, (4, 7, 9)>

6. Node 9:
    - <9, (1, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <9, (1, 8, 7)>
    - <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
