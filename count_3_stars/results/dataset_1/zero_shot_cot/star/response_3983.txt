Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The degree of each node is as follows:

Node 0: 1
Node 1: 2
Node 2: 2
Node 3: 2
Node 4: 4
Node 5: 3
Node 6: 3
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 3

From the degrees, we can see that Node 4 has a degree of 4, making it a central node. 

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph centered at Node 4:

1. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
2. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 9)>
4. <4, (2, 9, 6)>
5. <4, (9, 6, 8)>
6. <4, (6, 8, 7)>
7. <4, (8, 7, 5)>
8. <4, (7, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
