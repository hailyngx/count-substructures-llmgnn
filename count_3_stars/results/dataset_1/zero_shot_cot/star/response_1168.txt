Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We have the following 3-star structures in the graph:
<0, (1, 8, 0)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 9, 6)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [10].
