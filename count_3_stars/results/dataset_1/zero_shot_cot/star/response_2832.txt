Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the possible 3-stars in this graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
With the given information, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7. 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.

Next, let's list the possible 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 1)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 7)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
[7]
