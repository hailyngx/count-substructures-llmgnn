Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [8].
