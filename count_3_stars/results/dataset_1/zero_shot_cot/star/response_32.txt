Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 7)>
5. <4, (3, 6, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 4, 5)>
8. <7, (2, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 9, 0)>
10. <9, (1, 8, 5)>

So the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
