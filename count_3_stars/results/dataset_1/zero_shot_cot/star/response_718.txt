Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- (2, 1, 4) is a 3-star.
- (2, 3, 6) is a 3-star.
- (2, 4, 5) is a 3-star.
- (2, 6, 8) is a 3-star.
- (6, 0, 9) is a 3-star.
- (6, 2, 8) is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 5)>
<2, (6, 8, 8)>
<6, (0, 9, 9)>
<6, (2, 8, 8)>
