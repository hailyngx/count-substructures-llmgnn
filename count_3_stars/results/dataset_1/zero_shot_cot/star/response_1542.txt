Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1 and 7
- Node 1: Connected to node 0
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5 and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 4, 6
- Node 8: Connected to node 6
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 2, 6

From the information above, we can see that there are two potential 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 5 is the center node with leaves 2, 4, and 6: <5, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Node 6 is the center node with leaves 5, 7, and 9: <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
