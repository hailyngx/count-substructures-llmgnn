Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5
- Node 2 is connected to node 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 9
- Node 6 is connected to node 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9
- Node 8 is connected to node 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
2. Node 1: {0, 4, 5}
3. Node 3: {5, 6}
4. Node 4: {1, 7}
5. Node 5: {1, 3, 9}
6. Node 7: {0, 4, 9}
7. Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Now, count the number of 3-stars surrounding each node:
- 3-star at node 0: <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- 3-star at node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- 3-star at node 5: <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- 3-star at node 7: <7, (0, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
