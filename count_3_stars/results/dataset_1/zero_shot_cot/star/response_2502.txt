Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that act as centers with exactly three neighboring nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 9
   - Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2, 9
   - Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
   - Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8

2. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can see that the possible central nodes are: 2, 4, and 5.

3. Count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
   - For central node 2: (2, 3, 9) and (2, 6, 8) 
   - For central node 4: (4, 5, 9) and (4, 7, 8) 
   - For central node 5: (5, 0, 8) 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 6, 8)> 
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (0, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
