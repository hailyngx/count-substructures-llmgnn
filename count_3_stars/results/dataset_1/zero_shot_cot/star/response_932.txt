Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. We are looking for a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the information provided, we can list all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
