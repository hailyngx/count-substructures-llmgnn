Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.
The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Next, we can list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<2, (1, 8, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<6, (3, 9, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [5].
