Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is directly connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found, we get [9].
