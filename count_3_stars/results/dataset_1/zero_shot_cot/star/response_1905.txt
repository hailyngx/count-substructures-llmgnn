Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Connected nodes: 1, 4, 6
   <0, (1, 4, 6)>

2. Central node: 1
   Connected nodes: 0, 3, 7
   <1, (0, 3, 7)>

3. Central node: 2
   Connected nodes: 8, 9
   <2, (8, 9)>

4. Central node: 3
   Connected nodes: 1, 4
   <3, (1, 4)>

5. Central node: 4
   Connected nodes: 0, 3, 5
   <4, (0, 3, 5)>

6. Central node: 5
   Connected nodes: 4, 7
   <5, (4, 7)>

7. Central node: 6
   Connected nodes: 0
   <6, (0)>

8. Central node: 7
   Connected nodes: 0, 1, 5
   <7, (0, 1, 5)>

9. Central node: 8
   Connected nodes: 2, 9
   <8, (2, 9)>

10. Central node: 9
    Connected nodes: 2, 8
    <9, (2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
