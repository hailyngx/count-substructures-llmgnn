Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by an edge.  
From the given edges, the center node is node 0, and the nodes connected to it are: 2, 3, and 4.  

Next, let's find all possible 3-stars based on the connections mentioned above. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [3].
