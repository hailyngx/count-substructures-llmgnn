Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Central node 0: (1, 2, 4)
2. Central node 0: (1, 4, 5)
3. Central node 4: (0, 5, 6)
4. Central node 5: (0, 4, 9)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
