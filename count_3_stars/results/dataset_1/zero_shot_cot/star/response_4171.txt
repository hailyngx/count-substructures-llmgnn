Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes, which form the leaves of the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by finding all such configurations in the graph.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
