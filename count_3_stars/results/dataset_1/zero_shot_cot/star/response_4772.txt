Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will follow this step-by-step approach:

1. Identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these identified nodes, check if they form a valid 3-star.

Here are the steps along with the final answer:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4)
   - Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9)
   - Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7)
   - Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7)
   - Node 9 (connected to nodes 2 and 3)
   
2. For each identified node, check if they form a valid 3-star:
   - For Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
   - For Node 2: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
   - For Node 4: <4, (0, 6, 7)>
   - For Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)> <6, (4, 6, 7)>
   
3. Count of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (4, 6, 7)>
