Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are part of a 3-star. 

Nodes with degree 3 are potential centers of 3-stars. In this graph, the nodes with degree 3 are nodes 0, 2, and 9. 

Now, let's look at the neighbors of these nodes to form 3-stars. 

- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 2, and 7. 
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 6, and 9. 
- Node 9 has neighbors 2, 5, and 7. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars. 

<Node 0, (1, 2, 7)>
<Node 2, (0, 6, 9)>
<Node 9, (2, 5 ,7)>
