Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 7
Node 2: 1, 7
Node 3: 0, 6, 9
Node 4: 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 8: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 8 as leaves. 
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, 8 as leaves. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

All unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
