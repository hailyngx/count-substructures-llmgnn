Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected by exactly three edges (3 leaves). Here's the step-by-step process to find these 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three incident edges:
   - Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)
   - Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)
   - Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 9)
   - Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 6)
   - Node 4: (4, 2)
   - Node 5: (5, 7), (5, 8)
   - Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 9)
   - Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9)
   - Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7)
   - Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7)

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <2, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (7, 8, 5)>
   - <6, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <7, (0, 5, 8)>
   - <8, (0, 5, 7)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 6)>
