Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <1, (6, 7, -)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. <3, (2, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 8)>
6. <5, (4, 6, 8)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
8. <7, (1, 5, -)>
9. <8, (0, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (3, -, -)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. [10]
