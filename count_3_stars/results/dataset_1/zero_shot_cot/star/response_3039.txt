Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list the 3-stars by identifying the center nodes and their connected leaves:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 9, -)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, -)>
<6, (0, -,-)>
<7, (0, 9, -)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
