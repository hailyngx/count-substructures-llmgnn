Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars using the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (7)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 8)>
<7, (1, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
