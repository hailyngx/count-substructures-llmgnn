Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. The center node 0 has 4 leaves: 4, 5, 7, and 9. This results in 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 7)>.
2. The center node 1 has 1 leaf: 7. This results in 1 3-star: <1, (7, 0, 2)>.
3. The center node 2 has 2 leaves: 3 and 7. This results in 1 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 0)>.
4. The center node 3 has 5 leaves: 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. This results in 1 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 0)>.
5. The center node 4 has 4 leaves: 0, 3, 5, and 6. This results in 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 5)>.
6. The center node 5 has 4 leaves: 0, 3, 4, and 8. This results in 1 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 4)>.
7. The center node 6 has 3 leaves: 3, 4, and 7. This results in 1 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 7)>.
8. The center node 7 has 4 leaves: 0, 1, 2, and 6. This results in 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 2)>.
9. The center node 8 has 3 leaves: 3, 5, and 9. This results in 1 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 9)>.
10. The center node 9 has 2 leaves: 0 and 8. This results in 1 3-star: <9, (0, 8, 3)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
