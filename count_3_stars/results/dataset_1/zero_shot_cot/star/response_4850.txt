Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration, which consists of a center node connected to three other nodes. 

First, let's list all the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
