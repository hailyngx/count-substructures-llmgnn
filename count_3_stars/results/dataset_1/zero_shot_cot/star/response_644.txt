Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (3, 7, 5)>
- From node 3: <3, (2, 5, 7)>
- From node 4: <4, (0, 8, 7)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- From node 8: <8, (4, 7, -)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 7, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
