Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
