Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to others in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to node 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's count the number of 3-stars.
