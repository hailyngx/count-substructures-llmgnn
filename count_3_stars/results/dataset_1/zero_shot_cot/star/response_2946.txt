Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Let's start by listing all 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7)>
<9, (0, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get [6].
