Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the edges given, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 6: <2, (1, 9, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9: <3, (5, 6, 9)>

Now, we have identified all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Counting the number of these 3-stars, we get a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
