Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. 
Nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8 have degree 4, and nodes 2 and 9 have degree 3, which potentially can be the centers of 3-stars. 
Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 2, 8), (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 8), (0, 5, 8) -> 6 stars
- For node 3: (3, 2, 4), (3, 2, 5), (3, 2, 9), (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 9) -> 6 stars
- For node 4: (4, 0, 3), (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 8), (4, 3, 5), (4, 3, 8), (4, 5, 8) -> 6 stars
- For node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 0, 4), (5, 0, 6), (5, 3, 6), (5, 4, 6), (5, 7, 6) -> 6 stars
- For node 8: (8, 0, 2), (8, 0, 4), (8, 0, 9), (8, 2, 9), (8, 4, 9) -> 5 stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 5 = 29].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)> inside brackets.
