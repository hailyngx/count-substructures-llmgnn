Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list the unique ones, we will look for every node that has exactly 3 neighbors. Then, we will check if those neighbors form a 3-star pattern with the central node.

Here are the steps to solve this:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 9
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 8
   - Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4
   - Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
   - Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 9, 6
   - Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8, 9
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 9, 6
   - Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6
   - Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7

2. For each node with exactly 3 neighbors, check if they form a 3-star pattern:
   - Node 2 and its neighbors 0, 3, 8 form a 3-star <2, (0, 3, 8)>
   - Node 3 and its neighbors 1, 2, 4 form a 3-star <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   - Node 4 and its neighbors 1, 8, 9 form a 3-star <4, (1, 8, 9)>

3. Combine the identified 3-star patterns:
   - <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
