Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 2 is the center, connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
2. Node 5 is the center, connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
3. Node 9 is the center, connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6. <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
