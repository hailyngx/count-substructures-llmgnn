Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 6)>
4. <4, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <8, (2, 4, 6)>
6. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
