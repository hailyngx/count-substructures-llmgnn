Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6. (4 connections)
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. (3 connections)
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. (4 connections)
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9. (3 connections)

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
- From the identified nodes above, only node 2 and node 5 match the definition of a 3-star graph.

Step 3: Calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph.
- For node 2: Since it has 4 connections, there are 4 different 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
  <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- For node 5: Since it has 4 connections, there are 4 different 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
  <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Step 4: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
- The total number of unique 3-stars is [8]. 

Output: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>
