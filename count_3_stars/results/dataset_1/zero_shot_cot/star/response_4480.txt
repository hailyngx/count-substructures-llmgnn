Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The central nodes in a 3-star graph can have 1, 2, or 3 neighbor nodes, but we are only interested in the ones with exactly three neighbors. 

After analyzing the graph, we find that there are 5 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>


Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
