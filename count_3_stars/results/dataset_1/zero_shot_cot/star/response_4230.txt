Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These instances will form the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that have 3 neighbors:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, it can be the center of a 3-star. 
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9. Similarly, it has exactly 3 neighbors and can be the center of a 3-star.

2. Form 3-stars using the identified central nodes:
   - For Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 8)> forms a 3-star.
   - For Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 9)> forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>.
