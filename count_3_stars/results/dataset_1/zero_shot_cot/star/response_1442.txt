Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 0)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <3, (6, 7, 8)>
5. <5, (1, 2, 7)>
6. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <7, (3, 5, 8)>
8. <8, (3, 7, 9)>
9. <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
