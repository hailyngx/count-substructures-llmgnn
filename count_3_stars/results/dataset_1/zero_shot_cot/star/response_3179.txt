Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can search for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

Looking at the provided graph, node 0, node 1, node 2, and node 4 each have exactly three neighbors. 
Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
 
Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars, which is 4. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
