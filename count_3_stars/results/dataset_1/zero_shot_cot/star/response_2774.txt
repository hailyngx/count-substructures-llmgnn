Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes with 3 neighbors are: 
- Node 0 has neighbors 2, 7, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 3, 4
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 1, 4
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 6

From the above nodes, we can form the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
