Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star is formed when a center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [7] 3-stars.
