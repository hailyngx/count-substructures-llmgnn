Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (3, 5, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
