Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes are the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. In this case, the central nodes are nodes 0, 3, and 4.

Now, we will list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [7].
