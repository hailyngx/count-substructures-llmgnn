Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Number of nodes = 10
Number of edges = 22

To form a 3-star, we need a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by looking for all possible 3-stars:

1. Nodes with 3 connections (possible center nodes):
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6) ðŸ‘‰ <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 7) ðŸ‘‰ <4, (2, 7)>
- Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 8) ðŸ‘‰ <5, (1, 2, 6)> <5, (1, 6, 8)> <5, (1, 8, 2)> <5, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 2)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>.
