Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 6) => 2 possibilities
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4) => 2 possibilities
- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9) => 5 possibilities

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 0, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 0, 1)>
<6, (4, 0, 9)>
