Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star with center node 0: <0, (2, 5, 7)>
2. 3-star with center node 1: <1, (3, 7, 9)>
3. 3-star with center node 5: <5, (0, 8, 9)>
4. 3-star with center node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
5. 3-star with center node 9: <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [5].
