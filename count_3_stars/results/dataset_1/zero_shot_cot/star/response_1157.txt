Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8

By looking at the connections, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
3. <0, (4, 6, 8)>
4. <0, (6, 8, 5)>
5. <8, (1, 9, 3)> 
6. <8, (1, 9, 0)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
