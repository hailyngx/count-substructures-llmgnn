Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are the potential centers of 3-stars. We can exclude the nodes with less than three connections because they cannot be the central node in a 3-star.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using these central nodes:

For node 2:
- (2, 3, 6)
- (2, 3, 8)

For node 4:
- (4, 3, 6)
- (4, 3, 8)

For node 6:
- (6, 3, 4)
- (6, 3, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>.
