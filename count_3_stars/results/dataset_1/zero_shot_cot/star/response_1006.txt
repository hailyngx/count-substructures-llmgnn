Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
   [Total = 2]

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
   [Total = 1]

3. Node 2:
   - No 3-stars

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
   [Total = 1]

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (1, 2, 3)>
   [Total = 1]

6. Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <5, (0, 3, 8)>
   [Total = 2]

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 9)>
   [Total = 2]

8. Node 7:
   - No 3-stars

9. Node 8:
   - <8, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <8, (0, 5, 4)>
   [Total = 2]

10. Node 9:
   - No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
