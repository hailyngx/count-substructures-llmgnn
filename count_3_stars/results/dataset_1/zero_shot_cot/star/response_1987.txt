Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form a 3-star structure. 

From the provided edges, the nodes with the highest degree are nodes 0, 3, and 8 with degree 4 each. These nodes are the potential central nodes of the 3-stars.

Let's start by examining each potential central node to see if they form 3-stars and count the total number of 3-stars.

For node 0:
- (0, 2), (0, 3), and (0, 8) form 3 different 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <%0, (2, 3, 8)>. Hence, 3-stars count = 3.

For node 3:
- (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 7), and (3, 8) form 4 different 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <%3, (0, 4, 8)>. Hence, 3-stars count = 7.

For node 8:
- (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 7) form 3 different 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <%8, (0, 3, 7)>. Hence, 3-stars count = 10.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
