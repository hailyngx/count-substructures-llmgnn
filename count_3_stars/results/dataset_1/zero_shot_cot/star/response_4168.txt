Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 
From the given edges, we see that node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6. Therefore, node 5 is the central node of the 3-stars. 

Next, let's find all possible 3-stars with node 5 as the central node:
1. (0, 2, 4)
2. (0, 3, 9)
3. (0, 4, 6)
4. (2, 3, 7)
5. (2, 4, 8)
6. (3, 4, 5)
7. (4, 6, 7)
8. (5, 6, 8)
9. (5, 6, 4)
10. (5, 6, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 4)>.
