Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we can identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We will then list these unique 3-stars and output the total count in brackets. Let's begin:

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 6)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
