Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all 3-stars:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 9, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 0, 0)>
<8, (4, 9, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.
