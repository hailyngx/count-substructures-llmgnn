Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:
- Number of nodes: 10
- Number of edges: 36

Let's count the number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph.

### Step 1:
Identify potential central nodes, which are nodes with exactly 3 edges incident to them:
- Node 0 has 6 incident edges
- Node 1 has 4 incident edges
- Node 2 has 4 incident edges
- Node 3 has 2 incident edges
- Node 4 has 2 incident edges
- Node 5 has 4 incident edges
- Node 6 has 2 incident edges
- Node 7 has 4 incident edges
- Node 8 has 4 incident edges
- Node 9 has 6 incident edges

### Step 2:
List 3-star subgraphs:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

### Step 3:
Count the number of unique 3-star subgraphs:
[9] 

### Final Answer:
[9]
