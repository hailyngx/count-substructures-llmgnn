Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 9: <0, (4, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <3, (4, 7, 8)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 9: <5, (0, 6, 9)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <7, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The final count of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
