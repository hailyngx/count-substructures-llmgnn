Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the given graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-star configurations in this graph are:
<0, (1, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, -)>
<3, (2, 6, -)>
<4, (5, -, -)>
<5, (1, 0, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>

There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
