Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. Let's list them step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8)
   <0, (2, 6, 7)>
   <0, (2, 6, 8)>
   <0, (2, 7, 8)>
   <0, (6, 7, 8)>
   
2. Node 1: (1, 5)
   
3. Node 2: (2, 0) (2, 8)
   <2, (0, 6, 8)>
   
4. Node 4: (4, 6) (4, 7)
   
5. Node 5: (5, 1)
   
6. Node 6: (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7)
   <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   
7. Node 7: (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8)
   <7, (0, 4, 6)>
   
8. Node 8: (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9)
   <8, (0, 6, 7)>
   
9. Node 9: (9, 8)

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]  
List of 3-stars: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>
