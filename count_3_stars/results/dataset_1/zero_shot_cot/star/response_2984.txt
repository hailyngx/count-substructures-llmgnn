Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we get a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
