Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <5, (0, 2, 8)>
6. <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
