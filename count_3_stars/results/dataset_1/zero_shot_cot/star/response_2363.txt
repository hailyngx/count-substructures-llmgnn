Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 0)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <6, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (6, 9, 0)>
- <9, (7, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
