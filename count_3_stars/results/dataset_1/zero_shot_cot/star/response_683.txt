Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges, let's start counting the number of 3-stars. The unique 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
  
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 3)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
