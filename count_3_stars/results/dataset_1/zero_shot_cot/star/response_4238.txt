Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step.

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9. Thus, a 3-star is formed with node 2 as the center and nodes 0, 3, and 9 as the leaves. (2, 0, 3, 9)

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 8. In this case, there is a self-loop from node 3 to itself, but it still counts as a 3-star. (3, 2, 8, 8)

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 7. Here, we have a self-loop from node 7 to itself, forming another 3-star. (6, 7, 9, 7)

4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7. A 3-star is formed with node 8 as the center and nodes 3, 5, and 7 as the leaves. (8, 3, 5, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 8, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>
