Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-star structures. 

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 2, 6, and 8 as the leaves. 
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 1, 3, and 6 as the leaves. 
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 2, 7, and 8 as the leaves. 
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 0, 1, and 2 as the leaves. 
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 0, 1, and 3 as the leaves. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>

So, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
