Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

[3]

<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
