Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 9 unique 3-stars listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
