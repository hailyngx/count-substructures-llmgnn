Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with three adjacent edges.

After analyzing the provided graph, we find that the nodes with three adjacent edges are nodes 5 and 9. Hence, nodes 5 and 9 can be the centers of 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
