Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars, which consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [8].
