Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. For each node, identify its neighbors.
2. For each node, count the number of 3-stars it is a part of.

Let's go step by step:

Node 0: Neighbors are 5, 6, 8
Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 9
Node 3: Neighbors are 1, 6, 7
Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 7, 8
Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 8
Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 3, 5
Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 5, 6
Node 9: Neighbors are 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: 3-star with leaves (5, 6, 8)
- Node 1: No 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 5: 3-star with leaves (0, 8, 6)
- Node 6: 3-star with leaves (0, 1, 8)
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 8: 3-star with leaves (0, 5, 6)
- Node 9: No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 6)>
<0, (8, 6, 5)>
[3]
