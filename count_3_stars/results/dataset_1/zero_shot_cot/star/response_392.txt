Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6.

By counting the number of each unique 3-star, we get:
- Number of <3, (0, 1, 2)>: 1
- Number of <4, (0, 5, 6)>: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
