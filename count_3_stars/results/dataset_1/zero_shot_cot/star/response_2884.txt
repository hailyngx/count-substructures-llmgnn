Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph, let's identify the 3-stars present:

- There are two 3-stars centered at node 1:
  <1, (0, 6, 9)>
  <1, (6, 9, 0)>

- There is one 3-star centered at node 2:
  <2, (3, 8, 8)>

- There is one 3-star centered at node 4:
  <4, (7, 9, 9)>

- There is one 3-star centered at node 6:
  <6, (1, 8, 1)>

- There is one 3-star centered at node 8:
  <8, (2, 6, 7)>

- There is one 3-star centered at node 9:
  <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
