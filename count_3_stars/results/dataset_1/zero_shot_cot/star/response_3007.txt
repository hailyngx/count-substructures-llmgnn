Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 3
- Node 1 is connected to Node 6
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 4, 6, 7
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 5
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 6
- Node 9 is connected to Node 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
[]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
