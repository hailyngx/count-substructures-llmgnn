Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node for the 3-stars.  
In a 3-star graph, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.  
Let's examine each node to find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:  
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9. (3 connections)  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 0. (3 connections)  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4. (1 connection)  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9. (1 connection)  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7. (3 connections)  
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9. (3 connections)  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9. (1 connection)  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9. (4 connections)  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5. (2 connections)  
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, and 7. (5 connections)  

Based on the connections, the nodes that can be central nodes are 0, 1, 4, and 5.  

Step 2: Find the 3-stars for each central node.  
For central node 0, there is only one 3-star:  
<0, (1, 7, 9)>  

For central node 1, there is also only one 3-star:  
<1, (0, 7, 0)>  

For central node 4, there are two 3-stars:  
<4, (2, 5, 7)>  
<4, (5, 8, 7)>  

For central node 5, there is one 3-star:  
<5, (4, 8, 9)>  

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
