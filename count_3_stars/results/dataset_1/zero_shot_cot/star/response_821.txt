Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

We see that the center node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8). This forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 7, 8)>.

Similarly, the center node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9). This forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 7, 8)>.

Node 2 and node 3 do not have enough edges to form a 3-star.

Node 4 and node 5 do not have any edges connected to them, thus cannot form a 3-star.

For node 6, it has 3 edges: (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 9). This forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 9)>.

Node 7 has 5 edges: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9). This forms two 3-stars: <7, (0, 1, 5)> and <7, (0, 1, 6)>.

Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3). This forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 2)>.

Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7). This forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, and <9, (1, 4, 6)>.
