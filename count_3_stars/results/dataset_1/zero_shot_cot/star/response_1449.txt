Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a central node connected to three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
