Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes of these 3-stars.

Here are the central nodes along with their corresponding leaf nodes:
- Central node 0: Leaf nodes {2, 7, 9}
- Central node 2: Leaf nodes {0, 5, 6}
- Central node 3: Leaf nodes {4, 6, 9}
- Central node 5: Leaf nodes {2, 8}
- Central node 6: Leaf nodes {2, 3}
- Central node 7: Leaf nodes {0, 1}
- Central node 9: Leaf nodes {0, 3}

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 8)>
<6, (2, 3)>
<7, (0, 1)>
<9, (0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
