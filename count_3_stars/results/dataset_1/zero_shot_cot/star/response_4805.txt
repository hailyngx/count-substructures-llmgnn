Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:  

<0, (3, 8, 9)>  
<1, (3, 6, 8)>  
<2, (7, 8, -)>

Since there are 3 unique 3-stars found in the graph, the final answer is [3].
