Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Central Nodes**: Find the nodes with exactly three neighbors.

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5.

2. **Identify 3-Stars**: Identify the 3-stars by selecting the central node and its neighbors.

- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (7, 4, 5)>

3. **Count the Unique 3-Stars**: Count the unique 3-stars found.
