Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph.

The central nodes can be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
For each central node, we need to check if it has exactly 3 edges connected to it.

1. For node 0:
   - Node 0 has edges connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
   - <0, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 8)>

2. For node 1:
   - Node 1 has edges connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8.
   - <1, (0, 6, 8)>

3. For node 2:
   - Node 2 has edges connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
   - <2, (0, 6, 7)>

4. For node 3:
   - Node 3 has edges connected to nodes 6 and 8.
   - No 3-star pattern for node 3.

5. For node 4:
   - Node 4 has an edge connected to node 0.
   - No 3-star pattern for node 4.

6. For node 6:
   - Node 6 has edges connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
   - <6, (1, 2, 3)>

7. For node 7:
   - Node 7 has an edge connected to node 2.
   - No 3-star pattern for node 7.

8. For node 8:
   - Node 8 has edges connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
   - <8, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 9)>
   - <8, (1, 3, 9)>

9. For node 9:
   - Node 9 has an edge connected to node 2.
   - No 3-star pattern for node 9.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
