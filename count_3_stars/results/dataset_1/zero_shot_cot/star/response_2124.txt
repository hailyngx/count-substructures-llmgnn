Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
3. <0, (6, 5, 9)>
4. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
5. <3, (1, 7, 7)>
6. <6, (0, 8, 8)>
7. <9, (0, 5, 0)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
