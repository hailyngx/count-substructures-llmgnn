Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these nodes could potentially form 3-stars.

Nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 unique 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 1 forms 1 unique 3-star: <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 2 forms 1 unique 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 7 forms 1 unique 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
