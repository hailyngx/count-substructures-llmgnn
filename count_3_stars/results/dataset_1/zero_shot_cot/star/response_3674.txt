Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's list all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8
- Node 1: connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 2: connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6
- Node 6: connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9
- Node 9: connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8

Based on the above connections, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
