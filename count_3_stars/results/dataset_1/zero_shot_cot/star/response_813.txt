Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 9, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars: 

[7]
