Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to find all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. Let's list them step by step:

1. Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Nodes with three incident edges will be considered as centers of 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
