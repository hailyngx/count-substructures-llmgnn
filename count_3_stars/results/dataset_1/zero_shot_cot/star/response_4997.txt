Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are part of the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three edges.  
In this graph, nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, 7 have exactly three edges connected to them.

Step 2: For each of the identified nodes from Step 1, find the neighboring nodes connected by edges to form the 3-stars.  
- For node 0: (2, 3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6)
- For node 3: (0, 2, 6), (2, 0), (6, 0)
- For node 4: (0, 5), (5, 4)
- For node 6: (0, 3), (3, 0)
- For node 7: No 3-star as it has more than three edges connected to it.

Step 3: Determine the unique 3-stars.
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (3, 6)>
<0, (4, 5)>
<0, (6, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 5)>
<5, (4)>
<6, (0, 3)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
