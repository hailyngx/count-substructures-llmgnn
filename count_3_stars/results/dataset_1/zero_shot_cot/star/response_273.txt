Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph, we need to identify each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 1: (2, 4, 5)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 5)
- Node 4: (1, 6, 7)
- Node 5: (1, 2, 3)
- Node 6: (0, 1, 4)
- Node 7: (0, 4, 5)

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars:  
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-star subgraphs in the given graph is [6].
