Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (2, 4,  )>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
