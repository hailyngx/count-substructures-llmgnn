Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 5, 9
Node 1: 2, 4, 7
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 4: 1, 5, 6
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 9
Node 8: 3
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Central Node: 2, Leaves: 1, 3, 5
2. Central Node: 3, Leaves: 2, 5, 6
3. Central Node: 5, Leaves: 0, 2, 4
4. Central Node: 6, Leaves: 3, 4, 7
5. Central Node: 9, Leaves: 0, 2, 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
