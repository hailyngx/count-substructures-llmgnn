Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (2, 4, 9)>
6. <8, (0, 3, 5)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
