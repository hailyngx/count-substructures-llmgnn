Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node with exactly three edges, forming a 3-star pattern. For each of these nodes, let's list the unique 3-star patterns they are part of:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8:
    <0, (3, 6, 8)>
    
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7:
    <1, (2, 6, 7)>
    
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9:
    <2, (1, 8, 9)>
    
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5:
    <3, (0, 4, 5)>
    
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5:
    <6, (0, 1, 5)>
    
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6:
    <9, (2, 3, 6)>
    
Counting the unique 3-stars found above, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
