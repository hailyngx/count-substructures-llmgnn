Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
  
  - Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (1, 4, 6, 7)
  - Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 6)
  - Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 6, 9)
  - Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 1, 4)
  - Node 7 is connected to 2 other nodes (0, 5)
  - Node 3, 2, 8, and 9 are not connected to exactly three other nodes. 
  
Step 2: Form all possible 3-stars with the identified nodes.

  <0, (1, 4, 6)>
  <1, (0, 3, 6)>
  <4, (0, 6, 9)>
  <6, (0, 1, 4)>
      
Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
  
  [] = 4
