Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the connected nodes for each 3-star. 

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-star patterns by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
