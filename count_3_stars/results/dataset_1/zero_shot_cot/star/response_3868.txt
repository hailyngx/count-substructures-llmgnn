Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to count the number of 3-stars.

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Three-star 1: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. Three-star 2: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
3. Three-star 3: <3, (7, 8, 9)>

Let's count the total number of 3-stars: [3].

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
