Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for patterns where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [11].
