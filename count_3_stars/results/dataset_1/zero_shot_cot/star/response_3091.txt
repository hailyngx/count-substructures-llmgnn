Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph by identifying the central node and its connected nodes:
1. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
3. <5, (4, 6, 8)>
4. <6, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
