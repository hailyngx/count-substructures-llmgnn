Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
