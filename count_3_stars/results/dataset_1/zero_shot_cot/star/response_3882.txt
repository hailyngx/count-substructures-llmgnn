Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:

Node 0 is connected to Node 3.  
Node 1 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9.  
Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8.  
Node 3 is connected to Nodes 0, 8, and 9.  
Node 4 is connected to Nodes 7, 8, and 9.  
Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1 and 8.  
Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 4, and 9.  
Node 8 is connected to Nodes 2, 3, 4, and 5.  
Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 7.  

Now, we will find the 3-stars by checking each node for a possible center, and then finding its connected nodes to form 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (5, 7, 9)>  
<3, (0, 8, 9)>  
<4, (7, 8, 9)>  
<7, (1, 4, 9)>  
<9, (1, 3, 4)>  

Now, to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we count the number of unique 3-stars listed above: [5].
