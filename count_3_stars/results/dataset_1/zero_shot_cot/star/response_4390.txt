Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Let's list down the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 1: (2, 3, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 3: (1)
- Node 4: (5, 9)
- Node 5: (2, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 6: (5, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (6)
- Node 8: (1, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (2, 4, 5, 8)

2. Now, let's check each node if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 8)> - This forms a 3-star.
- Node 3: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 4: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 6: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 7: Not a center of a 3-star.
- Node 8: <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 8)> - This forms a 3-star.

3. Counting the total number of 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are <1, (2, 3, 8)> and <5, (2, 4, 9)>. The final answer is [2].
