Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.  

<0, (5, 8, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
