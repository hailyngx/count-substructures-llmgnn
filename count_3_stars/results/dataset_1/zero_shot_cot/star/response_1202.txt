Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <3, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 7: <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 4: <7, (0, 5, 4)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 9: <8, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
