Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1:
   - (1, 2), (1, 4)
   - <1, (2, 4, _)>

2. Node 2:
   - (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 8)
   - <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, _)>

3. Node 3:
   - (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9)
   - <3, (5, 8, 9)>

4. Node 4:
   - (4, 1)
   - <4, (1, _, _)>

5. Node 5:
   - (5, 3), (5, 7)
   - <5, (3, 7, _)>

6. Node 6:
   - (6, 8)
   - <6, (8, _, _)>

7. Node 7:
   - (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 8)
   - <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, _)>

8. Node 8:
   - (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   - <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, _)> 

9. Node 9:
   - (9, 3), (9, 8)
   - <9, (3, 8, _)>

There are a total of 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [11].
