Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 connections to other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
In this case, the nodes with 3 connections are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 8, and 1)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 3, 5, and 1)

Step 2: List the unique 3-stars found.
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 1)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
There are 5 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
