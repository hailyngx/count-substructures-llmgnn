Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that form 3-stars with the central node. 
Given that a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the central node and its neighbors to form 3-stars.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Central node 0:
    - <0, (1, 5, 9)>
  
2. Central node 1:
    - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
    - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
  
3. Central node 2:
    - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 9)>
  
4. Central node 3:
    - <3, (1, 2, 9)>
  
5. Central node 4:
    - <4, (1, 8, 5)>
  
6. Central node 5:
    - <5, (0, 2, 8)>
  
7. Central node 6:
    - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
  
8. Central node 8:
    - <8, (1, 4, 5)>
  
9. Central node 9:
    - <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Hence, there are a total of 13 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the output is: [13].
