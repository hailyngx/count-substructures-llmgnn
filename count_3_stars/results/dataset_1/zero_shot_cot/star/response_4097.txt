Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:
1. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <2, (4, 9, -)>
4. <3, (6, -, -)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (0, 4, -)>
7. <6, (3, 8, 9)>
8. <8, (1, 6, -)>
9. <9, (0, 1, 2)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
