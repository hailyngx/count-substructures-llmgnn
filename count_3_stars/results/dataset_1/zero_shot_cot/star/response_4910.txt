Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges (forming a 3-star). 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Considering these 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
