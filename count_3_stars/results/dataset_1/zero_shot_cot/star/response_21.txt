Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly 1 edge. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars. 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7.

Next, let's construct the 3-stars. We will only consider the unique 3-stars to avoid redundancy.

The 3-stars in the graph are:

<0, (7, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 5)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<6, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (9, 6, 2)>
<8, (2, 0, 1)>
<9, (7, 3, 4)>
