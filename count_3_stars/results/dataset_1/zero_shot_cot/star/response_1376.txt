Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with 3 edges (leaves) attached to them. 

Looking at the given graph:

- Node 1 has 5 edges connected to it
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it

Nodes 2 and 8 fit the criteria for being center nodes of a 3-star, as they have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
