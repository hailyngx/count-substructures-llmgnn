Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (2, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to node 4.
- Node 3 is connected to node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 5.

Next, let's count the 3-star structures in the given graph:
- Node 0 can form one 3-star: <0, (1, 6)>
- Node 6 can form two 3-stars: <6, (0, 5)>, <6, (5, 7)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
