Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
2. <3, (2, 5, 6)>
3. <9, (2, 3, 4)>
4. <9, (2, 3, 5)>
5. <9, (4, 5, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
