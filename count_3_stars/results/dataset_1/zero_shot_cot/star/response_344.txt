Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

1. Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 8) 
    <0, (7, 8)>
    
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7)
    <1, (3, 4, 7)>
    
3. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 9)
    <2, (4, 9)>
    
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 8)
    <3, (1, 8)>
    
5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 6)
   <4, (1, 2, 6)>
   
6. Node 5: (5, 7)
    <5, (7)>
    
7. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8)
    <6, (4, 7, 8)>
    
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 6)
    <7, (0, 1, 5), <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>
    
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6)
    <8, (0, 3, 6)>
    
10. Node 9: (9, 2)
    <9, (2)>
    
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
