Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (6, 8, _)>  
2. <1, (2, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (6, 8, _)>
5. <4, (2, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (4, 6, 7)>
7. <6, (0, 3, 5)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 4)>
9. <8, (0, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (1, 7, _)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
