Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
3. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <1, (2, 4, 9)>
5. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
6. <2, (3, 7, 1)>
7. <3, (2, 4, 7)>
8. <3, (4, 5, 7)>
9. <4, (0, 1, 3)>
10. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
11. <5, (3, 4, 9)>
12. <6, (0, 9, 1)>
13. <7, (2, 3, 1)>
14. <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
