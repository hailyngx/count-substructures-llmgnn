Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 9, -)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
