Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 
[8]
