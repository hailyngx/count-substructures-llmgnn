Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three connections:
   - Node 0: Connected to 2, 3, and 7
   - Node 1: Connected to 6, 8, and no other node
   - Node 2: Connected to 4, 6, and no other node
   - Node 3: Connected to 0, 4, and 5
   - Node 4: Connected to 2, 3, and 5
   - Node 5: Connected to 3, 4, and 6
   - Node 6: Connected to 1, 2, and 5
   - Node 8: Connected to 1, 6, and 9
   - Node 9: Connected to 4, 8, and no other node

2. Based on the analysis, we can identify the following 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <1, (6, 8, 9)>
   - <2, (4, 6, 3)>
   - <4, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 5)>

3. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
