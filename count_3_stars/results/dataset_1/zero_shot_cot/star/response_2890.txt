Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node in a 3-star pattern. These nodes will have exactly 3 edges connected to them in total.

- Node 0 has 6 edges connected to it: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9)
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3)
- Node 2 has 4 edges connected to it: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 8)
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 8)
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected to it: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 7)
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it: (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9)
- Node 8 has 2 edges connected to it: (8, 2), (8, 3)
- Node 9 has 3 edges connected to it: (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <7, (0, 2, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
