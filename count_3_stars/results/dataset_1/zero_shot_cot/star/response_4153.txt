Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step to find the number of 3-stars.

Step 1: Find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: Node 1, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9.
These nodes can potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars.

Step 2: For each of these nodes, find the nodes they are connected to.
- For Node 1: (0, 5, 6, 7)
- For Node 2: (4, 5, 8, 9)
- For Node 4: (2, 8, 9)
- For Node 5: (1, 2, 7)
- For Node 8: (2, 4)
- For Node 9: (2, 4)

Step 3: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
- From the analysis above, potential 3-star combinations are:
  <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Step 4: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
- Total unique 3-stars: [<1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>] = [7].

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
