Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. To be a part of a 3-star, a node should have exactly 3 edges connected to it. Let's list those nodes: <1>, <8>.

Now, let's find all possible 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
