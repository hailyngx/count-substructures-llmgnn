Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 0)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-star patterns in the given graph.
