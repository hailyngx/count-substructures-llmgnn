Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the central nodes of 3-stars.
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes (5, 8, 9).
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 4).
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 1, 4).
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 4, 7).

Step 2: For each central node, identify the connected nodes to form the 3-stars.
- For node 0: (0, 5, 8, 9) forms a 3-star. 
- For node 5: (5, 0, 3, 4) forms a 3-star. 
- For node 8: (8, 0, 1, 4) forms a 3-star. 
- For node 9: (9, 0, 4, 7) forms a 3-star. 

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
- There are 4 unique 3-stars: 
    <0, (5, 8, 9)>, 
    <5, (0, 3, 4)>, 
    <8, (0, 1, 4)>, 
    <9, (0, 4, 7)>.

Output: The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
