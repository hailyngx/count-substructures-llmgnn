Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify each 3-star by locating the central node and its three connected nodes. 
Next, we list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (5, 6, 7)>
3. <6, (0, 2, 7)>
4. <8, (0, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
