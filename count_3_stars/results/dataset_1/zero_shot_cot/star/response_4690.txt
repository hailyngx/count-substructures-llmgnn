Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all the unique 3-stars. 

First, let's list all the nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
