Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify each 3-star:
1. Node 0: (0, 1, 6, 7, 8)
   - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 4, 7)
   - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)
   - <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7)
   - <3, (1, 2, 4)>
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 3, 9)
   - <4, (1, 3, 9)>
6. Node 5: (5, 2, 3, 9)
   - <5, (2, 3, 9)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 2, 3, 7)
   - <6, (0, 2, 3)>
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 1, 2, 3, 6)
   - <7, (0, 1, 6)>
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 9)
   - <8, (0, 2, 9)>
10. Node 9: (9, 4, 5, 8)
   - <9, (4, 5, 8)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [9].
