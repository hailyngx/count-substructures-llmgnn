Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
6. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
7. <8, (3, 4, 9)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
