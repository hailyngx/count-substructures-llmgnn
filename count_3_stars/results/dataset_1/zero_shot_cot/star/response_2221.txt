Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
1. Start by identifying the central nodes in the graph. These are the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.
   
2.  Central nodes:  \{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9\}

3. For each central node, find the adjacent nodes to form unique 3-stars.

4. Unique 3-stars:
   - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 7)>
   - <7, (1, 2, 4)>
   - <9, (1, 3, 6)>
