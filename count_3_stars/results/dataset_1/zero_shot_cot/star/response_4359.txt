Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.

To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. Let's go through the nodes to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
3. Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. Node 3: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
5. Node 4: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
6. Node 5: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
7. Node 6: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.
10. Node 9: No 3-stars because it has less than 3 connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2] and they are <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>.
