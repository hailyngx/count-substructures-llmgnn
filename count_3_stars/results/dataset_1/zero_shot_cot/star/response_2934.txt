Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Let's list down the possible 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 9, -)>
<3, (1, -, -)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, -)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
