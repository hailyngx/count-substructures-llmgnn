Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step: 

1. Node 0: No 3-star as it only has one edge (0, 3)
2. Node 1: One 3-star <1, (3, 7, 2)>
3. Node 2: One 3-star <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3: One 3-star <3, (0, 1, 8)>
5. Node 4: No 3-star as it only has one edge (4, 6)
6. Node 5: No 3-star as it only has one edge (5, 7)
7. Node 6: One 3-star <6, (2, 4, 9)>
8. Node 7: One 3-star <7, (1, 2, 5)>
9. Node 8: No 3-star as it only has one edge (8, 3)
10. Node 9: No 3-star as it only has one edge (9, 5)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
And the unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (3, 7, 2)>, 
<2, (6, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
