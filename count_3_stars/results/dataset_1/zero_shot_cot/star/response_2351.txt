Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0: (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 7)  --> <0, (3, 4, 7)>  
2. For node 1: (1, 3, 6), (1, 6, 7)  --> <1, (3, 6, 7)>  
3. For node 2: (2, 6, 7)  
4. For node 3: (3, 0, 1), (3, 5, 8)  --> <3, (0, 1, 5)>  
5. For node 4: (4, 0, 7), (4, 7, 8)  --> <4, (0, 7, 8)>  
6. For node 5: (5, 3, 8)  
7. For node 6: (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 7)  --> <6, (1, 2, 7)>  
8. For node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 1, 6), (7, 4, 8), (7, 6, 9)  --> <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>  
9. For node 8: (8, 4, 5), (8, 5, 7)  --> <8, (4, 5, 7)>  
10. For node 9: (9, 7, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (3, 4, 7)>  
<1, (3, 6, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 5)>  
<4, (0, 7, 8)>  
<6, (1, 2, 7)>  
<7, (0, 4, 8)>  
<7, (1, 6, 9)>  
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
