Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:
1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 3)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 7)>
Total 3-stars for node 0: 2

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
Total 3-stars for node 1: 1

3. For node 2:
   - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
Total 3-stars for node 2: 1

4. For node 3:
   - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
Total 3-stars for node 3: 1

5. For node 4:
   - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
Total 3-stars for node 4: 1

6. For node 5:
   - No 3-star as it only has 2 edges.

7. For node 6:
   - No 3-star as it only has 2 edges.

8. For node 7:
   - <7, (0, 1, 5)>
Total 3-stars for node 7: 1

9. For node 8:
   - No 3-star as it only has 1 edge.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].   

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
