Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars found in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its connecting nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

The final answer is [7].
