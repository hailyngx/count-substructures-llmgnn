Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 1, 6), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 8)
- From node 1: (1, 0, 5)
- From node 2: (2, 0, 8), (2, 0, 9)
- From node 3: (3, 0, 4)
- From node 4: (4, 6, 8)
- From node 5: (5, 1, 7), (5, 1, 8)
- From node 6: (6, 0, 4)
- From node 7: (7, 0, 5)
- From node 8: (8, 0, 9), (8, 2, 4), (8, 2, 5), (8, 4, 9)
- From node 9: (9, 2, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 16.
