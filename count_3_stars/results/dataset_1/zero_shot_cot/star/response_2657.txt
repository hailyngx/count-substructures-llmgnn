Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges.

To find a 3-star, we look for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
   - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <0, (3, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (3, 4, 9)>
   - <0, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (4, 6, 9)>
   - Total: 7

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9.
   - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 9)>
   - Total: 2

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8.
   - <2, (1, 4, 5)>
   - Total: 1

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
   - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
   - Total: 1

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
   - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <4, (1, 5, 6)>
   - <4, (1, 5, 9)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <4, (5, 6, 9)>
   - Total: 9

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
   - <5, (2, 4, 6)>
   - Total: 1

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
   - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   - <6, (0, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (4, 5, 7)>
   - Total: 4

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
   - <7, (0, 5, 6)>
   - Total: 1

9. Node 8 is connected to node 2.
   - No 3-star with node 8.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5.
   - <9, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 4)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 5)>
   - Total: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges is [31], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (1, 2,...
