Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 9. <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 0, 5, and 9, and another with nodes 2, 6, and 9. <1, (0, 5, 9)> <1, (2, 6, 9)>
3. Node 5 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 0, 1, and 9, and another with nodes 3, 6, and 9. <5, (0, 1, 9)> <5, (3, 6, 9)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 9. <6, (1, 7, 9)>
5. Node 9 forms three 3-stars: one with nodes 0, 1, and 5, another with nodes 3, 6, and 8, and the last one with nodes 6, 7, and 8. <9, (0, 1, 5)> <9, (3, 6, 8)> <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
