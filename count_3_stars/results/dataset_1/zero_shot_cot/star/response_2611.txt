Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 9, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (8, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
