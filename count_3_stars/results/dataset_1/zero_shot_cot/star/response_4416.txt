Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's start by identifying the nodes connected to each node. 

For Node 0: (0, 5)
For Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8), (1, 9)
For Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 5)
For Node 3: (3, 1)
For Node 4: (4, 9)
For Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9)
For Node 6: (6, 9)
For Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 5)
For Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 5)>
<4, (9, 9, 6)>
<6, (9, 9, 4)>
<8, (1, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
