Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 1: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 5, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Next, we can count the number of 3-stars by examining each node and its connections. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given graph, there are 6 unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
