Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like configuration.

We can first identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.

We can now construct the unique 3-star configurations:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2)>
<6, (2, 9)>
<7, (0, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
