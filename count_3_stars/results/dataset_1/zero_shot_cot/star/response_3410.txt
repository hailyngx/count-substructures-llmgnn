Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that make up each 3-star in the graph. 
- Node 0: (3, 5, 6)
- Node 1: (8, 9)
- Node 2: (3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 3: (0, 2, 5, 6)
- Node 4: (2, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (0, 2, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 6: (0, 3)
- Node 7: (0, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 7)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 5, 7)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
