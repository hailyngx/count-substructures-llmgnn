Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). 

First, let's write down the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 3

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 1)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
