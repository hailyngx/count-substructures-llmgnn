Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central node of each 3-star.  
- Count the degree of each node to determine the central node.  
- In a 3-star, the central node has a degree of 3, while the other nodes have a degree of 1.  

Based on the given edges:  
- Node 0 has degree 2  
- Node 1 has degree 2  
- Node 2 has degree 5  
- Node 3 has degree 1  
- Node 4 has degree 2  
- Node 5 has degree 5  
- Node 6 has degree 3  
- Node 7 has degree 4  
- Node 8 has degree 5  
- Node 9 has degree 1  

So, the central nodes are 2, 5, and 8.


Step 2: Identify the leaves connected to each central node. 
- For each central node, list the nodes connected to it.  

For central node 2: (0, 1, 5, 8)  
For central node 5: (0, 2, 3, 8)  
For central node 8: (2, 4, 5, 6, 7)  


Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
- For each central node, consider the unique combinations of leaves around it.  

For central node 2:  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>  
<2, (0, 1, 8)>  
<2, (0, 5, 8)>  
<2, (1, 5, 8)>  

For central node 5:  
<5, (0, 2, 3)>  
<5, (0, 2, 8)>  
<5, (0, 3, 8)>  
<5, (2, 3, 8)>  

For central node 8:  
<8, (2, 4, 5)>  
<8, (2, 4, 6)>  
<8, (2, 4, 7)>  
<8, (2, 5, 6)>  
<8, (2, 5, 7)>  
<8, (2, 6, 7)>  
<8, (4, 5, 6)>  
<8, (4, 5, 7)>  
<8, (4, 6, 7)>  
<8, (5, 6, 7)>  

There are 14 unique 3-stars.  

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
