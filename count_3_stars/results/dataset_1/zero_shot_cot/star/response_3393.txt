Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since each 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to it, we can analyze the graph based on this information.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get [4].
