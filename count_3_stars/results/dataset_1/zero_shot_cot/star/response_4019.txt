Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are directly connected to node 0. These nodes will form 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9. 

So, the 3-stars with node 0 as the center are: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are directly connected to node 1. These nodes will form 3-stars with node 1 as the center. 
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9. 

So, the 3-stars with node 1 as the center are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>

There are no more 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, and <1, (6, 8, 9)>.
