Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars that can be found in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [6].
