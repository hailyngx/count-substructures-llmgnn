Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the given graph. The central nodes will be the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. 

Central nodes: 0, 4, 5, 8

Next, let's identify the leaves for each central node to form the 3-stars. We will consider the nodes that share an edge with the central node.

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [4]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
