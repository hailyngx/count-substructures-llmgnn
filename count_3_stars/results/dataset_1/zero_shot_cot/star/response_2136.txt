Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will consider each node in the graph as the potential center of a 3-star and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
