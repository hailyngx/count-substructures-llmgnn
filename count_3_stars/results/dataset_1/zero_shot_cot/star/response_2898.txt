Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Initially, we can list all possible 3-stars by considering each node as the central node and checking if it has exactly 3 edges. Then, we can determine whether these 3-stars are present in the given graph based on the provided edges.

1. Possible 3-stars (with potential central nodes):
   - Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5) -> Not a 3-star
   - Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7) -> 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 4) -> Not a 3-star
   - Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9) -> 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>
   - Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 9) -> Not a 3-star
   - Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 7) -> Not a 3-star
   - Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 7) -> Not a 3-star
   - Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 6) -> Not a 3-star
   - Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 4) -> Not a 3-star
   - Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 4) -> Not a 3-star

2. Unique 3-stars found:
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <3, (1, 4, 8)>
   - <3, (1, 4, 9)>
