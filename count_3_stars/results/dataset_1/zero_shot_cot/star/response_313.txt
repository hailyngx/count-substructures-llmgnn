Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (8, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 4, -)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 8, -)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
