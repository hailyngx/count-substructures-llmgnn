Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Start by listing all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be potential central nodes of 3-stars:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 4
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9

2. For each potential central node, check if the connected nodes form a 3-star:
   - For Node 0: (0, 2, 5, 8) does not form a 3-star.
   - For Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 3)> forms a 3-star.
   - For Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 6)> forms a 3-star.
   - For Node 8: (8, 0, 7, 9) does not form a 3-star.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [2]

4. List the unique 3-stars:
   - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <5, (0, 1, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
