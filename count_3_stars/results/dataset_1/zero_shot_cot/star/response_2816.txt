Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be our 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, -)>
<4, (2, -, -)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (8, -, -)>
<7, (3, 5, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (5, -, -)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
[10]
