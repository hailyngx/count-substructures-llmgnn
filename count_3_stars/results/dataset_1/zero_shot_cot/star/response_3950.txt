Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 1)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars found:

[8]
