Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 9), (1, 9)>
2. <1, (3, 7), (2, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 7), (5, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 7), (2, 5)>
5. <4, (0, 9)>
6. <5, (2, 8), (3, 8)>
7. <7, (1, 2), (3, 8)>
8. <9, (0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
