Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find:
[7]
