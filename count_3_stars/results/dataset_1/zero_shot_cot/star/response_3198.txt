Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>.
