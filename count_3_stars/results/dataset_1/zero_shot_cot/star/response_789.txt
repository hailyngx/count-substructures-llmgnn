Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 3. <0, (6, 7, 3)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, and 6. <2, (9, 5, 6)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8. <5, (1, 4, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6. <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
