Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, let's identify the unique 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars present in the graph.
There are [6] 3-star graphs in total.
