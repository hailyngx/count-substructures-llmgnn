Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's examine each node to see if they form 3-stars or not:
- Node 0: (0, 8) - Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1: (1, 6) - Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2: (2, 6, 7, 8) - Forms a 3-star: <2, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 4: (4, 6, 7, 9) - Forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 5: (5, 6) - Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6: (6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7) - Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 7: (7, 2, 4, 6, 9) - Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 9) - Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9: (9, 4, 7, 8) - Does not form a 3-star.

The final answer is [2] 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
