Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes with exactly three edges. Then, we look at the nodes adjacent to each central node to find the leaves of the 3-star.

Let's first find the central nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0 has 4 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 2 has 5 edges
- Node 3 has 5 edges
- Node 4 has 2 edges
- Node 5 has 4 edges
- Node 6 has 4 edges
- Node 7 has 4 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 9 has 4 edges

Next, we look at the nodes adjacent to each central node to find the leaves of the 3-star.

From the given information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 6)>
3. <1, (2, 6, 7)>
4. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
5. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
6. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
7. <3, (4, 7, 9)>
8. <5, (0, 6, 8)>
9. <5, (6, 9, 0)>
10. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
11. <6, (2, 5, 9)>
12. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
13. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
14. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
15. <8, (5, 9, 0)>
16. <9, (2, 3, 5)>
17. <9, (3, 4, 7)>
18. <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
<0, (1, 2, 5)> <1, (0, 3, 6)> <1, (2, 6, 7)> <2, (0, 3, 6)> <2, (1, 3, 7)> <3, (1, 2, 7)> <3, (4, 7, 9)> <5, (0, 6, 8)> <5, (6, 9, 0)> <6, (0, 1, 5)> <6, (2, 5, 9)> <6, (1, 2, 7)> <7, (1, 2, 3)> <7, (3, 4, 9)> <8, (5, 9, 0)> <9, (2, 3, 5)> <9, (3, 4, 7)> <9, (5, 6, 8)>
