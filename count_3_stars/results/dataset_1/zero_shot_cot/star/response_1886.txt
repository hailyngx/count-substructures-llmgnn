Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three connections.

From the given graph information, the nodes with exactly three connections are nodes 0, 1, 2, 6.

Step 2: For each node with exactly three connections, check if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0:
- Connected to nodes 3, 8.
- Forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 8)>

Node 1:
- Connected to nodes 3, 6.
- Forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 6)>

Node 2:
- Connected to node 5.
- Does not form a 3-star.

Node 6:
- Connected to node 1.
- Does not form a 3-star.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars found.

Number of 3-stars: 2

Step 4: Output the final answer.
