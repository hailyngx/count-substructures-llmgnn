Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is the center and has exactly three edges connected to it.

Let's denote the nodes connected to each other by edges:

(1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1:
   - 3-star: <1, (5, 3, 8)>

2. Node 2:
   - No 3-star found.

3. Node 3:
   - 3-star: <3, (5, 1, 8)>

4. Node 4:
   - 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>

5. Node 5:
   - 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>
             
6. Node 7:
   - No 3-star found.

7. Node 8:
   - 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 9)>

8. Node 9:
   - 3-star: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

<1, (5, 3, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>
