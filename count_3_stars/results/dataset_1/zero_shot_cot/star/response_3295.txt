Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.

So, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
