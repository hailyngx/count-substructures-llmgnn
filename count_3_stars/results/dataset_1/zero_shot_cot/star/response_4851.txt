Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go through each node in the graph and identify if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes. 

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
  <0, (5, 7, 8)> is a 3-star. 

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
  <1, (4, 6, 9)> is a 3-star.

Proceeding with node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8, but it only has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Exploring node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7, having more than 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Analyzing node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6, having more than 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Inspecting node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7, having more than 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Reviewing node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 5, having more than 3 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Examining node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
  <7, (0, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.

Looking at node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2, but it only has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Lastly, considering node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 3, but it only has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>.

Count of 3-stars: [3]
