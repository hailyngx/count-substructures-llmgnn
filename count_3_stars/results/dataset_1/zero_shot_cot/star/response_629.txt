Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. A central node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can see that the possible central nodes are: 1, 4, 8

Next, let's find the leaves (nodes connected to the central node) for each central node:

For central node 1:
Leaves: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
The 3-stars with central node 1 are: 
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 1, 5)>
<1, (5, 0, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 2)>
<1, (6, 0, 2)>

For central node 4:
Leaves: 1, 3, 4, 8
The 3-stars with central node 4 is: 
<4, (1, 3, 8)>

For central node 8:
Leaves: 1, 2, 4, 9
The 3-stars with central node 8 is: 
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 1, 5)>
<1, (5, 0, 2)>
<1, (4, 8, 2)>
<1, (6, 0, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
