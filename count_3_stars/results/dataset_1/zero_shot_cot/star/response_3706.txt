Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
    - 3-star not possible as only 2 edges: (0, 5) and (0, 7)

2. Node 1:
    - 3-star not possible as only 3 edges: (1, 2), (1, 7), and (1, 9)

3. Node 2:
    - 3-star possible: <2, (1, 4, 7)> 
   
4. Node 3:
    - 3-star not possible as only 3 edges: (3, 4), (3, 7), and (3, 8) 
    
5. Node 4:
    - 3-star possible: <4, (2, 3, 6)>
   
6. Node 5:
    - 3-star not possible as only 2 edges: (5, 0) and (5, 9)
    
7. Node 6:
    - 3-star not possible as only 1 edge: (6, 4)
    
8. Node 7:
    - 3-star possible: <7, (1, 2, 3)> 
    
9. Node 8:
    - 3-star not possible as only 2 edges: (8, 3) and (8, 7)
    
10. Node 9:
    - 3-star not possible as only 3 edges: (9, 1), (9, 5), and (9, 7)
    
So, the 3-stars in the given graph are: <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, and <7, (1, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
