Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The center nodes in the graph can be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's go through each center node and find the 3-stars:

Center 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- Total: 1

Center 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 0)>
- Total: 1

Center 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- Total: 3

Center 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- Total: 2

Center 4:
- <4, (3, 8, 3)>
- Total: 1

Center 5:
- None

Center 6:
- <6, (2, 2, 2)>
- Total: 1

Center 7:
- <7, (3, 2, 8)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- Total: 2

Center 8:
- <8, (4, 2, 7)>
- <8, (4, 7, 4)>
- Total: 2

Center 9:
- <9, (2, 3, 2)>
- Total: 1

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 2, 0)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 3)>, <6, (2, 2, 2)>, <7, (3, 2, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 4)>.
