Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars, which consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first identify the 3-stars using the given edges:
1. 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (2, 5, 8)>
3. 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 8)>
4. 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (0, 3, 7)>
5. 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
