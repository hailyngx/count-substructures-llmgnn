Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes and their connections. Based on the provided list of edges, the connections for each node are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 2
- Node 8 is connected to node 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6

Now, we can list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 2, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (2)>
<8, (0)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
