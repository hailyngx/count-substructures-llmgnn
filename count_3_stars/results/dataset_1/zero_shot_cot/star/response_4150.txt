Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
