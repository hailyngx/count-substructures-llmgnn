Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

1. 3-star centered at node 0: (0, 5, 6, 8)
2. 3-star centered at node 3: (3, 0, 5, 6)
3. 3-star centered at node 4: (4, 1, 7, 8)
4. 3-star centered at node 5: (5, 0, 3, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
