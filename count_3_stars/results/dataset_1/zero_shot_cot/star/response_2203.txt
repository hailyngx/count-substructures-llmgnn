Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's first list down all the unique 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [4].
