Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, and <3, (2, 4, 8)>.
