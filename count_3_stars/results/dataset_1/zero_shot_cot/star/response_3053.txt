Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaf nodes for each 3-star.

- Node 0 has 3 adjacent nodes: 1, 2, and 7. However, it does not form a 3-star since it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

- Node 1 has 5 adjacent nodes: 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9. We can form a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 5 as the leaves. Let's denote this as <1, (0, 2, 5)>.

- Node 2 has 3 adjacent nodes: 0, 1, and 5. However, it does not form a 3-star since it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

- Node 3 has 2 adjacent nodes: 6 and 7. However, it does not form a 3-star since it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

- Node 4 has 1 adjacent node: 9. However, it does not form a 3-star since it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

- Node 5 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 6, and 7. We can form a 3-star with node 5 as the center and nodes 1, 2, and 6 as the leaves. Let's denote this as <5, (1, 2, 6)>.

- Node 6 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 3, 5, and 9. We can form a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 1, 3, and 5 as the leaves. Let's denote this as <6, (1, 3, 5)>.

- Node 7 has 3 adjacent nodes: 0, 3, and 5. However, it does not form a 3-star since it's not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

- Node 9 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 4, 5, and 6. We can form a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 1, 4, and 5 as the leaves. Let's denote this as <9, (1, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the list of unique 3-stars in the given graph is <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, and <9, (1, 4, 5)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
