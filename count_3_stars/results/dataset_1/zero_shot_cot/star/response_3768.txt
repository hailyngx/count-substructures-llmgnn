Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Starting from node 0:
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>

Starting from node 1:
- No 3-star can be formed starting from node 1.

Starting from node 2:
- No 3-star can be formed starting from node 2.

Starting from node 3:
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <6, (3, 0, 7)>
- <7, (3, 0, 5)>
- <9, (3, 8, 0)>

Starting from node 4:
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (7, 4, 3)>
- <6, (0, 3, 7)>

Starting from node 5:
- No 3-star can be formed starting from node 5.

Starting from node 6:
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (9, 6, 1)>

Starting from node 7:
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (9, 7, 1)>

Starting from node 8:
- No 3-star can be formed starting from node 8.

Starting from node 9:
- <9, (3, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (3, 0, 7)>, <7, (3, 0, 5)>, <9, (3, 8, 0)>, <5, (7, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 1)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>].
