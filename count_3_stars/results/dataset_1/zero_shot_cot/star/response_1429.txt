Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes involved in the 3-stars based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- There are 4 possible 3-stars with node 0 as the center: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 1)>, <0, (3, 5, 0)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>.
- There are 1 possible 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 5, 6)>.
- There are 1 possible 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 2, 8)>.
- There are 1 possible 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, there are a total of 7 3-stars in the given graph.  
So the final answer is [7].
