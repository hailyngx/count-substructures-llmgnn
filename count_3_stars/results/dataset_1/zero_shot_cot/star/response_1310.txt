Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars in it.

1. Identify all nodes:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

2. Find nodes with degree 3 (nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes):
- Nodes with degree 3: 0, 1, 2, 3

3. For each node with degree 3, find its adjacent nodes:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6

4. Count the number of 3-stars based on the above information:
- 3-stars with center node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- 3-stars with center node 1: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- 3-stars with center node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- 3-stars with center node 3: <3, (0, 2, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars [5]. 
So, the final answer is [5].
