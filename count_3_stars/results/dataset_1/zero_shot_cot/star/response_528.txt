Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.
The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (6, -, -)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
