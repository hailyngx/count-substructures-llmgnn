Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph by checking each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon inspection, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
