Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

[<0, (3, 4, 7)>]
[<1, (4, 5, 8)>]
[<3, (0, 2, 6)>]
[<7, (0, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the graph.
