Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 8, -not connected-)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, -not connected-)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
