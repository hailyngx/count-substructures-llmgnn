Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8: <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 6: <3, (1, 9, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 8: <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8: <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 1: <8, (2, 4, 1)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 6: <9, (0, 3, 6)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph according to the provided edge information. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
