Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<5, (8, 1, 7)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.]
