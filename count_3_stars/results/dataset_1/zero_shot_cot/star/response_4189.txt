Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 7

To identify 3-stars, we need to look for nodes with exactly three edges connected. Let's list down the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>

There are [9] unique 3-stars in this graph.
