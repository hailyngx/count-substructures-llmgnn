Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (7, 8, 1)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, -)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, - , -)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, -)>
<9, (3, 5, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and represent it inside brackets:

[8]
