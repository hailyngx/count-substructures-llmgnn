Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations of 3-stars. 

First, let's list the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 7.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to Node 3.
- Node 8 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 2, 4, and 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (4, 2, 5)>
- <1, (5, 2, 4)>
- <1, (6, 2, 4)>
- <1, (6, 2, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (4, 1, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 1, 9)>
- <2, (5, 4, 9)>
- <2, (6, 1, 4)>
- <2, (6, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (2, 1, 9)>
- <4, (9, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (2, 1, 9)>
- <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting these combinations, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
