Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections to determine the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are two 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 7, X)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
