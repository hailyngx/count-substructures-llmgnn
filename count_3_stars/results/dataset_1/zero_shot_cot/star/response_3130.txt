Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Let's list all the 3-star graphs with unique central nodes and leaves:
<0, (7, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have found a total of [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
