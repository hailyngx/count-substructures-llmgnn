Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided edges, the 3-star patterns can be identified as follows:

<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, X)> (Note: No valid 3-star for node 2)
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 8, X)> (Note: No valid 3-star for node 9)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
