Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible sets of a central node and three other nodes that are connected to the central node. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-star configurations in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars we found: [8].
