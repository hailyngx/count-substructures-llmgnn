Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph by checking each node's connections.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9. This forms a 3-star centered at node 0 with leaves 2, 4, and 9. 

Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and has no other connections.

Node 3, 5, and 6 do not have 3-star configurations because they do not have exactly 3 connections.

Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star centered at node 7 with leaves 3, 8, and 9.

Node 1 is connected to node 9, forming a 3-star centered at node 1 with leaves 9.

There are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 9)> and <7, (3, 8, 9)>.
