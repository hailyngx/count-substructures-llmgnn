Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes are connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 7
Node 1: 0, 8
Node 2: 4, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 7
Node 4: 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 5: 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 9
Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 8: 1, 4, 7
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- For node 1: <1, (0, 8, 4)>
- For node 2: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- For node 3: <3, (0, 7, 5)>
- For node 4: <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>
- For node 5: <5, (7, 9, 7)>, <5, (7, 9, 6)>, <5, (7, 9, 9)>
- For node 6: <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- For node 7: <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- For node 8: <8, (7, 4, 7)>
- For node 9: <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>, <9, (6, 7, 6)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 4)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 5)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 7)>, <5, (7, 9, 6)>, <5, (7, 9, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (7, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 5)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>, <9, (6, 7, 6)>
