Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each occurrence of a 3-star. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Central nodes are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Check each node to see if it satisfies the conditions of being a central node.
3. For each central node found, list the nodes it is connected to (leave nodes) to identify a 3-star.
4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's start with the given graph:

List of edges:
(0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9)    -> <0, (3, 5, 9)>
2. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8)    -> <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 0)>
3. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8)    -> <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
