Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 7, -)>
4. <3, (5, 7, -)>
5. <5, (3, 8, -)>
6. <6, (8, 9, -)>
7. <7, (2, 3, -)>
8. <8, (1, 5, 6)>
9. <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
