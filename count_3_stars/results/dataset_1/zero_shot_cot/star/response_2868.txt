Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star can be any node in the graph. So, let's go through each node and find the 3-stars around them.

1. Central node: 0  
   - No 3-star as there are not enough connected nodes.

2. Central node: 1  
   - No 3-star as there are not enough connected nodes.
   
3. Central node: 2  
   - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
   
4. Central node: 3  
   - <3, (2, 7, 8)>
   
5. Central node: 4   
   - No 3-star as there are not enough connected nodes.
   
6. Central node: 5   
   - <5, (0, 6, 8)>
   
7. Central node: 6   
   - <6, (2, 5, 8)>
   - <6, (7, 8, 9)>
   
8. Central node: 7   
   - <7, (2, 3, 4)>
   
9. Central node: 8  
   - No 3-star as there are not enough connected nodes.
   
10. Central node: 9  
   - No 3-star as there are not enough connected nodes.

Count of 3-stars: [6]  
Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>
