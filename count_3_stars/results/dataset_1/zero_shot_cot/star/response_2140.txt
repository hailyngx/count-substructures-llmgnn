Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node for each potential 3-star in the graph. For each node, we will check if it has exactly three neighbors. 

1. Central Node 0: Neighbors {2, 8}
2. Central Node 1: Neighbors {6}
3. Central Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 9}
4. Central Node 3: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
5. Central Node 4: Neighbors {5}
6. Central Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
7. Central Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
8. Central Node 7: Neighbors {6, 8}
9. Central Node 8: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
10. Central Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 8}

From the analysis above, we can see that there are several 3-stars in the given graph. Now, let's list them.

<0, (2, 8, -)> represents a 3-star with node 0 as the central node and nodes 2 and 8 as the leaves.
<2, (0, 3, 9)> represents a 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 0, 3, and 9 as the leaves.
<3, (2, 5, 9)> represents a 3-star with node 3 as the central node and nodes 2, 5, and 9 as the leaves.
<6, (1, 5, 7)> represents a 3-star with node 6 as the central node and nodes 1, 5, and 7 as the leaves.
<8, (0, 7, 9)> represents a 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 0, 7, and 9 as the leaves.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
