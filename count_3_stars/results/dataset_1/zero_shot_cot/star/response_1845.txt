Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (8, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we have a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
