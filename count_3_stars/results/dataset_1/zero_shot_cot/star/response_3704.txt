Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star structure.

First, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [3].
