Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. Here is the breakdown of the 3-stars found in the graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 6, 7), (0, 6, 9), (0, 7, 9)  
2. Central node 1: (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 8), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 8), (1, 6, 8)  
3. Central node 2: (2, 4, 5)  
4. Central node 3: (3, 4, 7)  
5. Central node 4: (4, 1, 2), (4, 1, 3), (4, 1, 5), (4, 1, 6), (4, 1, 7), (4, 1, 8), (4, 2, 5), (4, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (4, 5, 7), (4, 6, 7), (4, 7, 8)  
6. Central node 5: (5, 1, 2), (5, 1, 4), (5, 1, 7), (5, 2, 4), (5, 4, 6), (5, 4, 7)  
7. Central node 6: (6, 0, 1), (6, 0, 4), (6, 0, 7), (6, 1, 4), (6, 4, 7)  
8. Central node 7: (7, 0, 3), (7, 0, 4), (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 6), (7, 0, 8), (7, 3, 4), (7, 4, 5), (7, 4, 6), (7, 4, 8)  
9. Central node 8: (8, 1, 4), (8, 1, 7), (8, 1, 9), (8, 4, 7)  
10. Central node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 0, 8), (9, 1, 8)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30] <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5)>, <3, (4, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>.
