Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
   - Node 0 has edges with nodes 2, 7, and 9.
   - Node 2 has edges with nodes 0, 4, and 7.
   - Node 4 has edges with nodes 2, 6, and 7.
   - Node 7 has edges with nodes 0, 2, and 4.
   
2. For each of these nodes, check if the neighbors form 3-stars with the node as the center.
   - For Node 0: (0, 2, 7), (0, 7, 9) -> <0, (2, 7, 9)>
   - For Node 2: (2, 0, 4), (2, 4, 7) -> <2, (0, 4, 7)>
   - For Node 4: (4, 2, 6), (4, 6, 7) -> <4, (2, 6, 7)>
   - For Node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 2, 4) -> <7, (0, 2, 4)>, (7, 4, 9) -> <7, (4, 0, 9)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
   - <0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, and <7, (4, 0, 9)>
   
Putting it all together, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is `[5]`.
