Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

There are three 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them: 
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
