Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For each node, we check how many potential 3-stars it's a part of. Since a 3-star requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look at each node and see if it has exactly three neighbors.
- The nodes that satisfy this condition are: 
  - Node 2, which has neighbors 1, 7, 9
  - Node 4, which has neighbors 5, 8, 9
  - Node 5, which has neighbors 1, 4, 6
  - Node 6, which has neighbors 3, 5, 7
  - Node 7, which has neighbors 2, 6, 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is 5.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
