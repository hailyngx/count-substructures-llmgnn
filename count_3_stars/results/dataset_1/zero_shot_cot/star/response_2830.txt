Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 8, 9  
Node 1: 5, 6  
Node 2: 8, 9  
Node 4: 9  
Node 5: 1, 9  
Node 6: 1, 8  
Node 8: 0, 2, 6  
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5  

Now, let's look for 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (8, 9) => <0, (8, 9)>
2. Node 1: (5, 6) => <1, (5, 6)>
3. Node 2: (8, 9) => <2, (8, 9)>
4. Node 8: (0, 6), (0, 2) => <8, (0, 6, 2)>
5. Node 9: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5) => <9, (0, 2, 4)>

We have found 5 unique 3-stars. Hence, the final answer is [5].
