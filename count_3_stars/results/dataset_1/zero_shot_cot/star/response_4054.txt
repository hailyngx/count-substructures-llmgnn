Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
7. <6, (2, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. <8, (4, 5, 7)>
10. <9, (7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
