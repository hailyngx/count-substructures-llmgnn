Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with three neighbors are node 0, node 3, and node 9.

Now, let's construct the 3-stars using the identified central nodes:

1. Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 6) => <0, (6, 9)>
2. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 9) => <3, (2, 8, 9)>
3. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3) => <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, we have identified three unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 3)>.

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
