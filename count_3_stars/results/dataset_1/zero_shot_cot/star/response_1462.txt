Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 9)>
<9, (5, 8)>

Now, we can count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
