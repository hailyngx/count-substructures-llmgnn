Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. 

Looking at the given edges:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 9
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 8
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 4
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 5
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 5

Therefore, the central nodes are 4, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (0, 1, 5)>

A total of [3] 3-stars are present in the given graph.
