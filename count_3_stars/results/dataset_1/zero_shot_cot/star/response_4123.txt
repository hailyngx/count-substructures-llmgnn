Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>

Since each 3-star is unique and listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
