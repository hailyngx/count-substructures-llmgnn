Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph along with their edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying all the possible 3-stars. Recall that a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (2, 8, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 7, 3)>
<9, (1, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
