Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here, we have the following 3-star structures:

<0, (3, 1, 9)>
<1, (3, 0, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
