Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 7)>
3. <3, (0, 5, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

[There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph.]
