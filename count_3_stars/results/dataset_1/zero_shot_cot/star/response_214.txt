Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes with 3 edges:
   - Node 0 has edges with nodes 3, 6.
   - Node 1 has edges with nodes 4, 6.
   - Node 2 has edges with nodes 5, 7, 9.
   - Node 4 has edges with nodes 1, 6, 8, 9.
   - Node 9 has edges with nodes 2, 4, 7.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - There are 3 unique 3-stars in this graph.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   <0, (3, 6)>
   <1, (4, 6)>
   <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
