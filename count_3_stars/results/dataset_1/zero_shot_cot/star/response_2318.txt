Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 since it will be the central node in our 3-star structures. The nodes connected to node 1 are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8. 

Now, we will look at each potential 3-star structure centered at node 1. We need to verify that each pair of nodes (other than node 1) connected to node 1 are also connected to each other. 

Here are the 3-star structures found:
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>

Now let's count the number of unique 3-star structures: [6].
