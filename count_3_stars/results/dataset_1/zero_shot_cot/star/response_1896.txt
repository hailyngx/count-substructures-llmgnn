Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the 3-star structures found in the graph:
<0, (5, 7, 4)>
<2, (3, 9, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 0)>
<8, (4, 9, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[6]
