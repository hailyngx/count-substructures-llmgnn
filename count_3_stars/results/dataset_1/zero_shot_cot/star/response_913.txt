Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first find out which nodes are connected to each node in the graph:

0: 2, 4, 5, 6  
1: 9  
2: 0, 3, 8  
3: 2  
4: 0, 5, 6  
5: 0, 4, 8, 9  
6: 0, 4, 7, 8  
7: 6  
8: 2, 5, 6  
9: 1, 5  

Now let's go through each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>  
- Node 1: Not part of any 3-star  
- Node 2: <2, (0, 3, 8)>  
- Node 3: Not part of any 3-star  
- Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 6)>  
- Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>  
- Node 6: <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>  
- Node 7: Not part of any 3-star  
- Node 8: <8, (2, 5, 6)>  
- Node 9: Not part of any 3-star  

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>.
