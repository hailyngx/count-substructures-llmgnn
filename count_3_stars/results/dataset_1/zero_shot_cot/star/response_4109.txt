Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible arrangements where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 7)
2. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 5)
4. Node 3: (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 6)
6. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9)
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5)
9. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 7)>
<1, (6, 8)>
<2, (5)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (6)>
<5, (2, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>

There are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
