Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 2, 4, 8)
2. Central node 1: (1, 3, 7, 9)
3. Central node 2: (2, 0, 4, 7)
4. Central node 3: (3, 1, 5)
5. Central node 4: (4, 0, 2, 9)
6. Central node 5: (5, 3, 6)
7. Central node 6: (6, 5, 7, 9)
8. Central node 7: (7, 1, 2, 6, 8)
9. Central node 8: (8, 0, 7)
10. Central node 9: (9, 0, 1, 4, 6)

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (3, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 4, 6)>
