Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. In this graph, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 are central nodes because they each have three edges connected to them.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. To do this, we'll consider each central node and find all possible 3-stars around them.

For each central node, we'll find the neighboring nodes connected to it and list all possible 3-stars with that central node.

1. For central node 0:
   <0, (7, 8, 9)>

2. For central node 1:
   <1, (3, 4, 5)>
   <1, (4, 2, 8)>

3. For central node 2:
   <2, (3, 4, 6)>
   <2, (4, 1, 6)>

4. For central node 3:
   <3, (1, 2, 4)>

5. For central node 4:
   <4, (1, 2, 3)>

6. For central node 5:
   <5, (1, 6, 7)>
   <5, (6, 2, 1)>

7. For central node 6:
   <6, (2, 5, 1)>

8. For central node 8:
   <8, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, and <8, (0, 1, 9)>.
