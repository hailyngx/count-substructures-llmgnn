Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. We will search for each node connected to exactly 3 neighbors.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 0:
   - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <0, (1, 6, 8)>
   Total: 3

2. For node 1:
   - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 7)>
   Total: 3

3. For node 2:
   No 3-star found.

4. For node 3:
   - <3, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <3, (0, 1, 8)>
   Total: 3

5. For node 4:
   - <4, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 2, 5)>
   Total: 3

6. For node 5:
   No 3-star found.

7. For node 6:
   - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
   Total: 1

8. For node 7:
   - <7, (1, 3, 9)>
   Total: 1

9. For node 8:
   - <8, (0, 3, 4)>
   Total: 1

10. For node 9:
   No 3-star found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [14].
