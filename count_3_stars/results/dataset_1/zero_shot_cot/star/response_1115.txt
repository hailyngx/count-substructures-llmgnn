Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 8: Connected to node 7.
- Node 9: Connected to node 1.

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars.
- Possible 3-stars involving node 0: None (no 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 1: <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Possible 3-stars involving node 2: None (no 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 3: None (no 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 4: None (no 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 5: None (has more than 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 6: None (no 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 7: None (no 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 8: None (no 3 connections).
- Possible 3-stars involving node 9: None (no 3 connections).

Based on the above analysis, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>
