Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Start with each node in the graph and look for nodes connected to it by exactly three edges. 
2. For each node found in step 1, create a 3-star structure with the current node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves. 
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars formed.

Let's apply the steps to the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8. We have a 3-star: <0, (3, 6, 7)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8. We have a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 8)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5. We have a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 5)>.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. We have a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 5)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. We have a 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 6)>.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4. We have a 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 4)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4 only (less than 3 connections).
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9 only (less than 3 connections).
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5. We have a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 3)>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7 only (less than 3 connections).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, and <8, (0, 1, 3)>.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
