Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 3: (3, 4, 6)
2. Node 4: (4, 1, 5)
3. Node 5: (5, 4, 7)

Therefore, there are three 3-stars in the given graph. 

The final answer is [3].
Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 6, 1)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 1, 7)>
