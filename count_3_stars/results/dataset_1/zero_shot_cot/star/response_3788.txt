Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the center nodes of the 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Now, we can form the following 3-stars based on the identified center nodes:
<2, (4, 8, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 8, 8)>
<4, (2, 8, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
