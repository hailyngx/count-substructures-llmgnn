Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
To form a 3-star, a node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list these nodes and their connections: 
1. Node 0: (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
2. Node 1: (3, 5, 9)
3. Node 2: (0, 6)
4. Node 3: (0, 1, 6, 9)
5. Node 4: (0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
6. Node 5: (0, 1, 4, 6, 9)
7. Node 6: (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9)
8. Node 7: (4, 9)
9. Node 8: (0, 4)
10. Node 9: (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
