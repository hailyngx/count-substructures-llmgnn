Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's go through each node and find the nodes it is connected to:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
