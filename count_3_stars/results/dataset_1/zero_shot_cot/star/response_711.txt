Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes will have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes.
From the given edges, the central nodes are: 0, 4, 6, 7.

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node and create the 3-stars.
For central node 0: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7) => <0, (3, 6, 7)>
For central node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6) => <4, (1, 3, 6)>
For central node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4) => <6, (0, 2, 4)>
For central node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5) => <7, (0, 3, 5)>

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
