Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 1)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 0, 6)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 7)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 8, 9)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 8)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 9)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [7].
