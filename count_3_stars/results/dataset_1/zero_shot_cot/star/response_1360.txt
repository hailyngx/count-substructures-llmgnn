Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

1. Node 0:
   - (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9)
   <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 2, 9)>, <0, (9, 6, 4)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Node 2:
   - (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9)
   <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>

3. Node 4:
   - (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8)
   <4, (0, 5, 8)>

4. Node 5:
   - (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6)
   <5, (2, 4, 6)>

5. Node 6:
   - (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7)
   <6, (0, 5, 7)>

6. Node 9:
   - (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8)
   <9, (0, 2, 7)> 

Putting all unique 3-stars together, we have:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 2, 9)>, <0, (9, 6, 4)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
