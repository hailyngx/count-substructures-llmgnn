Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <2, (1, 8, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <5, (1, 9, -)>
5. <6, (4, 9, -)>
6. <7, (1, 4, -)>
7. <8, (1, 2, -)>
8. <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Now we need to count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
