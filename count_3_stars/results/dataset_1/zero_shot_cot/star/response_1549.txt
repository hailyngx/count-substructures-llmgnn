Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
    
    1. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
    2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    3. <3, (0, 6, 7)>
    4. <5, (1, 6, 7)>
    5. <7, (0, 1, 3)>
    6. <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Now, we have identified all the 3-stars in the graph. Counting them, we find that there are 6 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
