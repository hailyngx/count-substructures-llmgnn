Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 4
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: 1 3-star (<0, (1, 4)>)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (<1, (0, 4)>)
- Node 3: 1 3-star (<3, (4, 5)>)
- Node 4: 4 3-stars (<4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (<8, (4, 9)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
