Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
