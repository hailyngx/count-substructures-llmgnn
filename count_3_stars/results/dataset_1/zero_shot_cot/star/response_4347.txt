Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's go step by step:

1. Start by identifying the nodes connected to each node. This will help us easily recognize 3-stars.
2. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star with any three connected nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
