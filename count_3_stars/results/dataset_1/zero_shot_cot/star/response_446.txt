Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 1: (1, 4, 7)
2. Central node 4: (4, 1, 8)
3. Central node 8: (8, 2, 4)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
 
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
