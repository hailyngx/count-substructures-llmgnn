Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes Connected to Three Other Nodes:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
    - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
    - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
    - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

2. Counting 3-Stars:
    - We have identified the following 3-stars in the given graph:
        <0, (1, 2, 6)>
        <1, (0, 3, 9)>
        <3, (1, 4, 6)>
        <4, (3, 5)>
        [4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
