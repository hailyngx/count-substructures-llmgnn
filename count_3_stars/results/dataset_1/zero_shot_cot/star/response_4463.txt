Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We know that a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to the central node. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: 

- <1, (4, 9, 2)>
- <2, (1, 8, 0)>
- <4, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 8, -)> 

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The final answer is: [6]
