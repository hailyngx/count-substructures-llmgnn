Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to determine the number of 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's analyze the nodes and their connections to identify the 3-stars:  

- Node 0 has connections with nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. It forms three 3-stars with the following leaf nodes: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, and <0, (2, 3, 5)>.

- Node 1 has connections with nodes 0 and 8. However, it does not form any 3-stars since it lacks the required number of connections.

- Node 2 has connections with nodes 0, 3, and 7. It forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 3, 7)>.

- Node 3 has connections with nodes 0 and 2. It also does not form any 3-stars due to insufficient connections.

- Node 4 has connections with nodes 5 and 7. It does not form any 3-stars due to the lack of a central node connection.

- Node 5 has connections with nodes 0, 4, and 9. It forms one 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 9)>.

- Node 6 has a connection with node 0 but lacks additional connections for a 3-star.

- Node 7 has connections with nodes 2 and 4. It does not form any 3-stars due to the lack of a central node connection.

- Node 8 has a connection with node 1 but lacks additional connections for a 3-star.

- Node 9 has a connection with node 5 but does not form a 3-star due to the lack of additional connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 5, 6)>, and <0, (2, 3, 5)>.
