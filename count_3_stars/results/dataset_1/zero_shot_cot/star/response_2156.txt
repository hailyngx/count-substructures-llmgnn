Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes.
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph. 
Using the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 connections. These nodes will be potential central nodes. 
From the edges given, nodes 3, 5, and 8 each have 3 connections, making them potential central nodes.

Step 2: Find the leaves of each potential 3-star.
For node 3:
- (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 5) are the edges connected to node 3. 
Therefore, the 3-star with node 3 as the central node is <3, (1, 2, 5)>.

For node 5:
- (5, 3), (5, 4), and (5, 8) are the edges connected to node 5. 
Therefore, the 3-star with node 5 as the central node is <5, (3, 4, 8)>.

For node 8:
- (8, 3), (8, 5) are the edges connected to node 8. 
Therefore, the 3-star with node 8 as the central node is <8, (3, 5)>.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
In this graph, we have found 3 unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, and <8, (3, 5)>.
