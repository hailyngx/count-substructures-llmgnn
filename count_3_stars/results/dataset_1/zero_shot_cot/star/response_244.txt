Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes of the graph. From the given edges, we have nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph.  
To do this, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars:  
<0, (2, 3, 6)>  
<1, (3, 5, 6)>  
<2, (0, 4, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 7)>  
<7, (1, 2, 3)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (2, 3, 6)>  
<1, (3, 5, 6)>  
<2, (0, 4, 7)>  
<3, (0, 1, 7)>  
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
