Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. For node 0:
    - (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 8)>

2. For node 1:
    - (1, 5) does not form a 3-star as node 1 is connected to only one other node.

3. For node 2:
    - (2, 0) (2, 3) does not form a 3-star as node 2 is connected to only two other nodes.

4. For node 3:
    - (3, 2) (3, 7) does not form a 3-star as node 3 is connected to only two other nodes.

5. For node 4:
    - (4, 7) (4, 8) does not form a 3-star as node 4 is connected to only two other nodes.

6. For node 5:
    - (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) forms one 3-star: <5, (0, 1, 8)>
    - (5, 9) does not form a 3-star as node 5 is connected to only two other nodes.

7. For node 6:
    - (6, 7) (6, 9) does not form a 3-star as node 6 is connected to only two other nodes.

8. For node 7:
    - (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) forms one 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 6)>

9. For node 8:
    - (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) forms one 3-star: <8, (0, 4, 5)>

10. For node 9:
    - (9, 5) (9, 6) does not form a 3-star as node 9 is connected to only two other nodes.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>.
