Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7
- Node 9: 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[The total number of 3-stars: 6]

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
