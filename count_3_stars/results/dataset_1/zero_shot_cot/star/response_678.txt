Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (4, 7, -)>
<1, (8, 9, -)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, -)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
