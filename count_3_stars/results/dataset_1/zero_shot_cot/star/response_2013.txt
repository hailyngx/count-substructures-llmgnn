Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 8)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 7)>
3. Node 2 forms two 3-stars: <2, (0, 8)> and <2, (6, 8)>
4. Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 5)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 9)>
10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8)>
<1, (5, 7)>
<2, (0, 8)>
<2, (6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
