Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Given the edge list, we can construct the following 3-stars: 
1. <0, (2, 8, 1)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (7, 8, 3)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 6)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 5)>
8. <7, (4, 8, 3)>
9. <8, (0, 2, 5)>
10. <9, (3, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
