Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by looking at each node and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. Each 3-star will have the center connected to three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (7, 2, 1)>
<1, (2, 8, 0)>
<2, (1, 8, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (8, 3, 9)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
