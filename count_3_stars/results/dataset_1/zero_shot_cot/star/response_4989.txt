Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Center node: 0, Leaves: 6, 8
2. Center node: 1, Leaves: 3, 5
3. Center node: 2, Leaves: 8
4. Center node: 3, Leaves: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
5. Center node: 4, Leaves: 3, 5, 7
6. Center node: 5, Leaves: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
7. Center node: 6, Leaves: 0, 3, 5
8. Center node: 7, Leaves: 3, 4
9. Center node: 8, Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
10. Center node: 9, Leaves: 5, 8

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the count of 3-stars is [10].
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8)>
<1, (3, 5)>
<2, (8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 3, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 8)>
