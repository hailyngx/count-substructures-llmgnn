Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to node 0:
- Node 1, Node 5, Node 9

Step 2: Identify the nodes connected to node 1:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 8

Step 3: Identify the nodes connected to node 3:
- Node 4, Node 8, Node 9

Step 4: Identify the nodes connected to node 4:
- Node 3, Node 5, Node 6

Step 5: Identify the nodes connected to node 5:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 4, Node 8

Step 6: Identify the nodes connected to node 8:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5

Step 7: Identify the nodes connected to node 9:
- Node 0, Node 3

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3)>
