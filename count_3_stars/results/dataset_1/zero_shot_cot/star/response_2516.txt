Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

There are [16] unique 3-stars in the graph as follows:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)> 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
