Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 9)
2. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6)
3. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7)
8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9)
9. Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now, let's list all unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 9)>
<1, (5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
