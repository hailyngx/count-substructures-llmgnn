Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first find the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree = 3) to identify the potential 3-stars in the graph.  

The nodes connected to the center node (0) are: 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's check each potential 3-star.  

Nodes connected to 3: 0, 7, 8, 9.  
This forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 7, 8)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]  
The unique 3-star found is: <3, (0, 7, 8)>
