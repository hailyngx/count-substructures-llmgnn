Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9

2. Based on the connections identified in step 1, we find the following 3-stars in the graph:
   - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 4)>
   - <2, (1, 8, 9)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars identified: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
