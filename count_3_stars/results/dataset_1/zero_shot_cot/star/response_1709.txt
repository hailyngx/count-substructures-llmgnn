Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with 3 edges.  
Nodes with 3 edges are 1, 8, and 9.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars using the nodes found in Step 1.  
For node 1:  
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>  
- <1, (4, 8, 7)>  
- <1, (7, 4, 8)>  
- <1, (7, 8, 4)>  
- <1, (8, 4, 7)>  
- <1, (8, 7, 4)>  
Total 3-stars for node 1: 6

For node 8:  
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>  
- <8, (1, 4, 8)>  
- <8, (1, 5, 4)>  
- <8, (4, 1, 5)>  
- <8, (4, 5, 1)>  
- <8, (5, 1, 4)>  
Total 3-stars for node 8: 6

For node 9:  
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>  
- <9, (0, 3, 2)>  
- <9, (2, 0, 3)>  
- <9, (2, 3, 0)>  
- <9, (3, 0, 2)>  
- <9, (3, 2, 0)>  
Total 3-stars for node 9: 6 

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.  
Total unique 3-stars: 6 + 6 + 6 = 18
