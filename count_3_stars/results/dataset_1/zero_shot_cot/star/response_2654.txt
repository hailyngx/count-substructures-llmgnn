Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to three other nodes, forming 3-stars.

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

[6]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
