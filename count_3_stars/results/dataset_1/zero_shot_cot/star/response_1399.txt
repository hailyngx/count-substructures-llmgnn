Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (6, 3, 9)>
- <2, (7, 6, 1)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 1)>
- <8, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (6, 3, 9)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the graph.  

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
