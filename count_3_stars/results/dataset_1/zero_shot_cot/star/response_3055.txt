Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- From node 0: <0, (5, 6, 1)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
