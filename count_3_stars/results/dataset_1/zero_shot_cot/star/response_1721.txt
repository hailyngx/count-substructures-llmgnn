Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars with their central node and leaf nodes. 

Based on the provided information, the unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 9, -)>
<2, (1, 7, -)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, -)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
