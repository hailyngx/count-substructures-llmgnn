Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the edges, we can see that nodes 1, 4, and 9 do not form a 3-star with the given criteria, as they have only one connection each.
2. Nodes 0 and 1 form a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 1)>
3. Nodes 2 and 8 form a 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. Nodes 3, 4, and 6 form a 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 6)>
5. Nodes 5 and 9 form a 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 9)>
6. Nodes 7 also forms a 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
