Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 3)>
<3, (2, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 0)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
