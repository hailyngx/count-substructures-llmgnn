Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we can determine the leaves connected to these center nodes to form the 3-stars.

From the provided edges, we can identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
