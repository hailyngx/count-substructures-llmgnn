Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the center nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has one central node connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges. 

The nodes with three edges are 1, 6, and 9. Now, let's find the leaves connected to these central nodes to construct the 3-stars. 

For node 1:
- (1, 3)
- (1, 6)
- (1, 7)

For node 6:
- (6, 2)
- (6, 5)
- (6, 8)

For node 9:
- (9, 3)
- (9, 5)
- (9, 6)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- The 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- The 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (2, 5, 8)>
- The 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (3, 5, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [3].
