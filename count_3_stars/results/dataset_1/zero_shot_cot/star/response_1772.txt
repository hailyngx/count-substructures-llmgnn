Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given edges, the unique 3-stars in the graph can be represented as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
