Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly 1 edge. This will give us the potential central nodes for the 3-stars.

Potential central nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6

Now, let's check for each potential central node if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

1. For Node 0: Not a central node as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
2. For Node 1: Not a central node as it is connected to 3 other nodes, but it already has a connection to Node 6 which forms a 3-star.
3. For Node 2: <2, (0, 6, 9)> is a 3-star.
4. For Node 3: Not a central node as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
5. For Node 5: Not a central node as it is connected to only 2 other nodes.
6. For Node 6: Not a central node as it is already part of the 3-star <1, (6, 8, 9)>.
7. For Node 7: Not a central node as it is connected to 3 other nodes, but it already has connections to form 2 different 3-stars, <3, (7, 8, 5)> and <6, (7, 2, 9)>.
8. For Node 8: Not a central node as it is already part of the 3-star <1, (8, 6, 9)>.
9. For Node 9: Not a central node as it is already part of the 3-star <1, (9, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is:
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
