Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly three incident edges.

The nodes with exactly three incident edges are: 
- Node 0 has 1 incident edge
- Node 5 has 4 incident edges
- Node 6 has 1 incident edge
- Node 7 has 2 incident edges

Therefore, nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7 are potential central nodes for 3-stars, but we need to verify if they are indeed centers of 3-stars by checking their neighbors.

Checking Node 0: Node 0 is connected to Node 1, but it does not form a 3-star as Node 1 has more than 3 incident edges.
Checking Node 5: Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 3, but it does not form a 3-star as these nodes are not connected to each other.
Checking Node 6: Node 6 is connected to Node 3, which has more than 3 incident edges.
Checking Node 7: Node 7 is connected to Nodes 2 and 4. Node 2 and Node 4 are also connected to Node 8, forming a 3-star. 

Therefore, there is one 3-star in the given graph:
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
