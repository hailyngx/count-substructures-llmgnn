Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7. So, the 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
   <4, (2, 3, 6)>
   <4, (2, 3, 7)>
   <4, (2, 6, 7)>
   <4, (3, 6, 7)>

2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7. So, the 3-stars with node 5 as the center are:
   <5, (0, 1, 6)>
   <5, (0, 1, 7)>
   <5, (0, 6, 7)>
   <5, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
