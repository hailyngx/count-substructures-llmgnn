Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

- Node 1: (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 9), (1, 6, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 6, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 9), (5, 7, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 4, 5), (7, 5, 9)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

<1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, )>, <5, (1, 9, )>, <7, (4, 5, )>
