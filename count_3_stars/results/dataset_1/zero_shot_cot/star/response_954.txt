Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 6, and 9.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [3].
