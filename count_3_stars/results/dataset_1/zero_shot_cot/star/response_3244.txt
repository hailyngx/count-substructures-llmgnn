Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of unique 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes and their connectivity:
- Node 0 is connected to node 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 1 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 6. <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 2 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 4. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 1, 2, and 3. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 6 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 0, 1, and 4. <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7 is a central node of a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 6. <7, (4, 5, 6)>

There are [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
