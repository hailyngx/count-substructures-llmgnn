Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
