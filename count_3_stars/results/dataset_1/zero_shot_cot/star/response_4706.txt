Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node (a node with exactly 3 edges connected).
Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 5
Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4
Nodes connected to node 2: 1, 4, 9
Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 5, 6, 7
Nodes connected to node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
Nodes connected to node 5: 0, 3, 7
Nodes connected to node 6: 3, 4
Nodes connected to node 7: 3, 5, 8
Nodes connected to node 8: 4, 7
Nodes connected to node 9: 2

2. Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the central node and its connected nodes:
- For node 1: (0, 1, 5)
- For node 2: (1, 2, 4)
- For node 3: (1, 3, 5)
- For node 4: (1, 2, 4)
- For node 5: (0, 1, 5)
- For node 7: (3, 5, 7)
- For node 8: (4, 7, 8)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (4, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
