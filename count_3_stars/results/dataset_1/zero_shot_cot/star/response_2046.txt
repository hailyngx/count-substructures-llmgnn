Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 2, 6, 8)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 8)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 9)

Next, let's count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
   [2]

2. For Node 3:
   - <3, (2, 6, 8)>
   [1]

3. For Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 8, _)>
   [1]

4. For Node 7:
   - No 3-star as it does not have 3 unique neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
