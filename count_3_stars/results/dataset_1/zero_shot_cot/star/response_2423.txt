Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly 3 edges are potential central nodes of 3-stars. From the given edges, the nodes with 3 edges are nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.

Now, we will check each potential central node to see if they form 3-stars. 

For node 0:
- (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 8) form a 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>

For node 4:
- (4, 0), (4, 7) do not form a 3-star as node 7 is connected to 2 nodes.
- (4, 0), (4, 7) do not form a 3-star as node 0 is connected to 2 nodes.

For node 8:
- (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6) form a 3-star: <8, (0, 5, 6)>

For node 9:
- (9, 2), (9, 5) do not form a 3-star as node 2 is connected to only node 9.
- (9, 2), (9, 5) form a 3-star: <9, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 8)> and <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
