Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the graph:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.

Here, we can see that nodes 2 and 5 both have 3 connections each. Thus, there are two possible 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (7, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
