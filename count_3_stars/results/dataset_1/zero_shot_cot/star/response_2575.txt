Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have 3 edges connected to it. Let's list all nodes with 3 edges:

- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 1)
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 2)

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph: 

[<2, (3, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 7, 1)>, <9, (2, 4, 2)>]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
