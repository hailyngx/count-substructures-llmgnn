Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node and its three connected nodes. 

By analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
