Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

Given graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 2), (8, 0), (8, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 0 has connections to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has connections to nodes 0, 2, and 3. It can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. Node 2 has connections to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 has connections to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has connections to nodes 0, 3, and 9. It can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 9. <4, (0, 3, 9)>
6. Node 5 has connections to nodes 0 and 2. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 has connections to nodes 3 and 9. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has a connection to node 2. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 has connections to nodes 0 and 2. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 has connections to nodes 4 and 6. Since it is not connected to exactly 3 nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<1, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>
