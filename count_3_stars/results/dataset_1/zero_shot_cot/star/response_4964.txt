Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. These nodes must have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Potential central nodes: 2, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 2:
   <2, (0, 1, 5)>
   <2, (1, 0, 5)>
   <2, (5, 0, 1)>
   [3-stars for node 2: <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 0, 5)>, <2, (5, 0, 1)>]

2. For node 5:
   <5, (0, 2, 6)>
   <5, (2, 0, 6)>
   <5, (6, 0, 2)>
   [3-stars for node 5: <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 0, 6)>, <5, (6, 0, 2)>]

3. For node 6:
   <6, (2, 5, 9)>
   <6, (5, 2, 9)>
   [3-stars for node 6: <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 2, 9)>]

4. For node 8:
   No 3-star since node 8 has more than 3 edges connected to it.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

<2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 0, 5)>, <2, (5, 0, 1)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 0, 6)>, <5, (6, 0, 2)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 2, 9)> 
[7]
