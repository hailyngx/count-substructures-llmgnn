Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6. Hence, <1, (2, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. Hence, <2, (1, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7. Hence, <3, (0, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5. Hence, <4, (1, 3, 5)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8. Hence, <5, (2, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8. Hence, <6, (1, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9. Hence, <7, (3, 6, 9)> is a 3-star.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9. Hence, <8, (5, 6, 9)> is a 3-star.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7. Hence, <9, (4, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
