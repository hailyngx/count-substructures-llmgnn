Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph. 

Given the connections between nodes, we can list out the 3-stars as follows:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 6, )>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
