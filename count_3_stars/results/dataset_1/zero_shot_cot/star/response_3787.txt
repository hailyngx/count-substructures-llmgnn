Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (4, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <3, (2, 8, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
7. <8, (0, 3, 9)>
8. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
