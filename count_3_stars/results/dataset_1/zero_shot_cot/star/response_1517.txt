Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first find all the 3-stars in the graph.

To count the 3-stars, we need to identify all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes can potentially serve as the centers of 3-stars.

Here are the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 3, 6)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 3, 5)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 6, 7, 8)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 2, 6)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 4, 9)

From the above list, we see that nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. Let's look at the connections of these nodes to identify the 3-stars.

- For node 1, the 3-star is <1, (0, 3, 6)>
- For node 2, the 3-star is <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- For node 3, the 3-star is <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- For node 4, the 3-star is <4, (6, 7, 8)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
   
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
