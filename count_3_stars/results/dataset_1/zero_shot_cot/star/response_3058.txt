Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars that exist in the graph.

First, we will find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, as these nodes can serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7.

Now, we will form the 3-stars using the identified central nodes and their connected nodes:

<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
