Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star configurations. In this case, we are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>  
<2, (3, 5, 6)>  
<3, (1, 2, 6)>  
<4, (1, 5, 8)>  
<5, (2, 4, 6)>  
<6, (1, 2, 3)>  
<8, (0, 1, 5)>  

Count of 3-stars: [7]
