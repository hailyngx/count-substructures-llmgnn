Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for all nodes with exactly 2 incident edges. These nodes will be the center nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify them first.

Identifying center nodes:
- Node 1 has 3 incident edges
- Node 2 has 2 incident edges
- Node 3 has 5 incident edges
- Node 5 has 2 incident edges
- Node 6 has 3 incident edges
- Node 7 has 1 incident edge
- Node 8 has 1 incident edge
- Node 9 has 4 incident edges

So, the center nodes are nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8.

Now, we will find all 3-stars with these center nodes and calculate the total count.

For node 2:
- (2, 0, 9)
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>

For node 5:
- (5, 3, 6)
- <5, (3, 6, 5)>

For node 7:
- No 3-star

For node 8:
- No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (0, 6, 9)> and <5, (3, 6, 5)>.
