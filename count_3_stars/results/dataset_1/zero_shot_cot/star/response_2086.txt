Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 since it will be the center of the 3-star:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.

Now, we can check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star with node 0:
1. For node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5.
   - A 3-star is formed with node 3 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 4 as leaves: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
    
2. For node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
   - A 3-star is formed with node 5 as the center and nodes 0, 2, and 4 as leaves: <5, (0, 2, 4)>
    
3. For node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
   - Node 6 does not form a 3-star with node 0.
    
4. For node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star with node 0.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 2, 4)> and <5, (0, 2, 4)>.
