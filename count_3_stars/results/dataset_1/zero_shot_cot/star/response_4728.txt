Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Given the information provided, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 6)>
5. <4, (3, 5, 9)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (1, 3, 9)>
8. <7, (1, 9, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 9, 7)>
10. <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Since we have identified 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [10].
