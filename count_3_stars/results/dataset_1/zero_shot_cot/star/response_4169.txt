Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with three connections:
   - Node 0 has 3 connections: (0, 1), (0, 6), (0, 9)
   - Node 2 has 4 connections: (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 9)
   - Node 7 has 4 connections: (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 9)
   - Node 9 has 5 connections: (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)

2. For each node with three connections, form 3-stars:
   - 3-stars for node 0: <0, (1, 6, 9)>
   - 3-stars for node 2: <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>
   - 3-stars for node 7: <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>
   - 3-stars for node 9: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>

So we have a total of 7 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [7].
