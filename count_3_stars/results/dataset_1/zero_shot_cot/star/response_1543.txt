Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and the three nodes connected to it.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. Central Node: 0, Connected Nodes: 3, 7, 9
2. Central Node: 1, Connected Nodes: 2, 3, 5
3. Central Node: 2, Connected Nodes: 1, 7, 8
4. Central Node: 3, Connected Nodes: 0, 1, 9
5. Central Node: 7, Connected Nodes: 0, 2, 4
6. Central Node: 8, Connected Nodes: 2, 7
7. Central Node: 9, Connected Nodes: 0, 3

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 7)>
<9, (0, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
