Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Based on the given edges, the following nodes can be identified as potential centers for 3-star graphs: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs formed by each potential center: 
- Center 0: <0, (8, 9)>
- Center 2: <2, (3, 7), (2, 9)>
- Center 3: <3, (1, 2), (3, 6)>
- Center 4: <4, (5, 6), (4, 7)>
- Center 5: <5, (4, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)>
- Center 7: <7, (2, 4), (3, 5), (7, 5)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [5].
