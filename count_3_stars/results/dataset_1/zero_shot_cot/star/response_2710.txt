Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5)>
<7, (1, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
