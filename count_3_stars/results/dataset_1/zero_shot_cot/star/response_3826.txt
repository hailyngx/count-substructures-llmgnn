Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (8, 9, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 2)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
