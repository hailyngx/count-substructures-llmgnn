Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0: <0, (1, 9, 9)>
2. Node 3: <3, (2, 7, 9)>
3. Node 4: <4, (7, 9, 9)>
4. Node 7: <7, (3, 4, 9)>
5. Node 8: <8, (2, 9, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph: [5].
