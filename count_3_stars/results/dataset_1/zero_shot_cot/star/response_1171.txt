Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9)
   - <0, (1, 2, 6)>
   - <0, (8, 9, 6)>
   (2 3-stars)
   
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 2, 3, 6)
   - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 2)>
   (2 3-stars)

3. Node 2: (2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
   - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <2, (0, 9, 2)>
   (2 3-stars)

4. Node 3: (3, 1, 2)
   - No 3-stars

5. Node 4: (4, 6, 8)
   - No 3-stars

6. Node 5: (5, 2, 8)
   - No 3-stars

7. Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9)
   - <6, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <6, (0, 7, 9)>
   (2 3-stars)

8. Node 7: (7, 2, 6, 9)
   - No 3-stars

9. Node 8: (8, 0, 4, 5, 6)
   - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
   - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
   (2 3-stars)

10. Node 9: (9, 0, 2, 6, 7)
   - <9, (0, 6, 7)>
   (1 3-star)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (8, 9, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 6, 2)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 9, 2)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
