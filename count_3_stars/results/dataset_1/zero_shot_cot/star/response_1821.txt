Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to each node.  
Node 0: 4, 5, 9  
Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7  
Node 2: 1, 8, 9  
Node 3: 1, 6, 9  
Node 4: 0, 1  
Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9  
Node 6: 3, 5, 9  
Node 7: 1, 5  
Node 8: 2  
Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.  
By analyzing the connections, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>  
<1, (2, 3, 4)>  
<1, (2, 4, 5)>  
<1, (3, 5, 7)>  
<2, (1, 8, 9)>  
<3, (1, 6, 9)>  
<5, (0, 6, 7)>  
<5, (1, 6, 9)>  
<6, (3, 5, 9)>  
<9, (0, 3, 5)>  
<9, (2, 5, 6)>  
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].  
Therefore, the answer is [11].
