Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (4, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 3)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
