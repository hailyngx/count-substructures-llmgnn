Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at each node and its connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6. It forms a 3-star with center node 0 and leaves 3 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. It forms a 3-star with center node 1 and leaves 3 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8. It does not form a 3-star because it doesn't have exactly three connections.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9. It forms a 3-star with center node 3 and leaves 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 6. It does not form a 3-star because it has only one connection.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 9. It forms a 3-star with center node 6 and leaves 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 9. It does not form a 3-star because it has only one connection.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2. It does not form a 3-star because it has only one connection.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. It forms a 3-star with center node 9 and leaves 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 6)>
<1, (3, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
