Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We can start by looking at each node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes.

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3 and 4. <1, (3, 4)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9. <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1. Since it doesn't have 3 leaves, we exclude it.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 2. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with node 0. Since it doesn't have 3 leaves, we exclude it.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 9. <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 7. <9, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 4)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, and <9, (0, 2, 7)>.

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars identified: [6].
