Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The given graph consists of the following edges:
- (0, 2) (0, 5)
- (1, 6)
- (2, 0) (2, 3) 
- (3, 2)
- (4, 6) (4, 9)
- (5, 0) (5, 7) 
- (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9)
- (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9)
- (8, 7) 
- (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7)

Now let's find the 3-stars:  
[<0, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 9, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>]
