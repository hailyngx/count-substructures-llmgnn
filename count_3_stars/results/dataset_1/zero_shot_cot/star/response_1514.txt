Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed with node 0 as the central node.
2. Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed with node 1 as the central node.
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>
4. Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed with node 3 as the central node.
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 9)>
7. Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed with node 6 as the central node.
8. Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed with node 7 as the central node.
9. Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed with node 8 as the central node.
10. Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
