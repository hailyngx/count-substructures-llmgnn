Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 9, _)>  
<1, (3, _, _)>  
<2, (5, 7, 9)>  
<3, (1, _, _)>  
<4, (0, 9, _)>  
<5, (2, 6, 9)>  
<6, (5, 8, 9)>  
<7, (2, _, _)>  
<8, (6, 9, _)>  
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
