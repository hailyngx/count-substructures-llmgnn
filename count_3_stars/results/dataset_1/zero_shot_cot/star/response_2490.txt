Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star. 

Looking at the edge list, we can see that there are multiple 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them below and count them:

<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>

By listing all unique 3-stars, we can see that there are 9 different 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
