Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first find all the 3-stars. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 9, 9)>
<6, (3, 9, 9)>
<8, (2, 9, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
