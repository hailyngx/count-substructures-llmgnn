Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   - <0, (1, 2, _)> (Node 0 is the center)

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
   - <1, (0, 4, _)> (Node 1 is the center)

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
   - <2, (0, 5, _)>
   
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - <4, (1, 7, _)> (Node 4 is the center)

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
   - <5, (2, 9, _)>
   
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
   - <6, (5, 8, _)>
   
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   - <7, (3, 4, _)>
   
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
   - <8, (2, 6, _)>
   
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
   - <9, (4, 5, _)>

[There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph.]
