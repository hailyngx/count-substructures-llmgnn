Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (7, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to node 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

- For node 0: It forms 2 unique 3-stars as the center. [2]
    - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 4)>
    
- For node 3: It forms 2 unique 3-stars as the center. [2]
    - <3, (0, 1, 5)>
    - <3, (0, 5, 9)>
    
- For node 4: It forms 1 unique 3-star as the center. [1]
    - <4, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
