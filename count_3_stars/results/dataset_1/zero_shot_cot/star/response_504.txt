Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
    - Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6 have 4 neighbors each. Exclude them.
    - Nodes 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 have less than 3 neighbors. Exclude them.
    
Step 2: Identify potential center nodes.
    - Nodes 1 and 8 can be considered as center nodes because they have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 3: For each potential center node, identify the 3-stars.
    - For node 1: (1, 5, 6), (1, 6, 2)
    - For node 8: (8, 0, 3)
    
Therefore, there are two unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>.
Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
