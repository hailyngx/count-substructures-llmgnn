Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, and 9.
   - <0, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <0, (1, 6, 9)>
   - <0, (1, 8, 9)>
  
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 8, and 9.
   - <1, (0, 3, 8)>
   - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 8, 9)>
  
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
   - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
   
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7.
   - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 3)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <8, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <8, (0, 3, 7)>
   
Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars:
