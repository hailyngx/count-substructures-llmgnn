Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, )>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, )>
<6, (1, 2, )>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
