Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:
1. The center node is node 0. Nodes 5 and 6 are connected to node 0, forming a 3-star <0, (5, 6)>
2. The center node is node 1. Nodes 4, 7, and 8 are connected to node 1, forming a 3-star <1, (4, 7, 8)>
3. The center node is node 2. Nodes 4, 7, and 8 are connected to node 2, forming a 3-star <2, (4, 7, 8)>
4. The center node is node 3. Nodes 5, 7, and 8 are connected to node 3, forming a 3-star <3, (5, 7, 8)>
5. The center node is node 4. Nodes 1, 2, and 5 are connected to node 4, forming a 3-star <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. The center node is node 5. Nodes 0, 3, and 8 are connected to node 5, forming a 3-star <5, (0, 3, 8)>
7. The center node is node 7. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are connected to node 7, forming a 3-star <7, (1, 2, 3)>
8. The center node is node 8. Nodes 1, 2, and 3 are connected to node 8, forming a 3-star <8, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (5, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
