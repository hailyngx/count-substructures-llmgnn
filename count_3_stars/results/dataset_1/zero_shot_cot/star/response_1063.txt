Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 8)>
4. <3, (6, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (7)>
6. <5, (2, 7)>
7. <6, (3, 9)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 2)>
10. <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
