Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node which has three edges connected to it. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. We will then identify the leaves connected to these central nodes to form the 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

- Central Node: 0 [2, 3, 7]
- Central Node: 1 [4, 5, 9]
- Central Node: 2 [4, 5, 9]
- Central Node: 3 [4, 5, 7]
- Central Node: 4 [1, 2, 7]
- Central Node: 5 [1, 2, 3]
- Central Node: 6 [2, 3, 8]
- Central Node: 7 [0, 3, 4]
- Central Node: 8 [2, 6, 9]
- Central Node: 9 [1, 2, 8]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
