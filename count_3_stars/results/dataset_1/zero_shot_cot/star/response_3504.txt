Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 7, 9)>
2. <2, (4, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (2, 5, 8)>
4. <6, (1, 2, 9)>
5. <9, (0, 7, 2)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5].
