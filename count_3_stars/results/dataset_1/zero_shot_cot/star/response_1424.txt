Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
