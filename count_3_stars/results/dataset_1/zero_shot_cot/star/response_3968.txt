Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<1, (5, 0, 3)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<7, (2, 8, 3)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
