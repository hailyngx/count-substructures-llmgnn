Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 since the center of the 3-star must be one of these nodes: 6, 7. 
For each potential center node, let's find the leaves connected to it:

For node 6:
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (0, 5, 8)>

For node 7:
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>

Combining all unique 3-stars found, we have: 
[<6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>] 

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [4].
