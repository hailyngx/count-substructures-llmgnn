Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
    - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
    - There is a 3-star at node 0.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.
    - <1, (0, 4, 5)>
    - There is a 3-star at node 1.

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
    - <5, (0, 1, 3)>
    - There is a 3-star at node 5.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
  
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>
