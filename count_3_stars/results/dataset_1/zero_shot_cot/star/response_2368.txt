Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This can be done by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Based on the given information, the possible 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
