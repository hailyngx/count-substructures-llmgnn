Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 0)>
<3, (8, 0, 0)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
