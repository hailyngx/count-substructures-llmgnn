Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to node 0, as node 0 will be the center of the 3-stars. The nodes connected to node 0 are: 1, 3, and 4. 

Now, for each of these connected nodes, let's check if they have exactly 2 other connections, which would form a 3-star configuration with node 0. 

For node 1: Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4. One more connection is needed for a 3-star.

For node 3: Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. One more connection is needed for a 3-star.

For node 4: Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9. Node 4 already has more than 3 connections, so it cannot form a 3-star with node 0.

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<0, (1, 4, x)>
<0, (3, 7, x)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
