Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 8, -)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 9)>
3. <3, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <4, (2, 3, 8)>
5. <8, (0, 3, 4)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [5].
