Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 4)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (2, 3, 6)>
7. <6, (1, 5, 9)>
8. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
9. <8, (3, 7, 9)>
10. <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
