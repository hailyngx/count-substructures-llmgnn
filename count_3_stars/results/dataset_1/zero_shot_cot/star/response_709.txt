Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Here are the possible 3-stars:

1. Central Node 1: Leaves (0, 2, 5, 6)
2. Central Node 2: Leaves (1, 4)
3. Central Node 4: Leaves (2, 3, 7)
4. Central Node 5: Leaves (1)
5. Central Node 6: Leaves (1)
6. Central Node 7: Leaves (4)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

1. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <1, (5, 6, 0)>
5. <1, (6, 2, 5)>
6. <2, (1, 4)>
7. <4, (2, 3, 7)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
