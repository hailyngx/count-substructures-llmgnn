Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
