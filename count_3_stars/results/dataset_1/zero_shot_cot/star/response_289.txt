Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify the central nodes:
- The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- The central node of a 3-star is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Checking the given edges, we find that the nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 3, 7, and 9.

Step 2: Find the leaves connected to each central node:
- For central node 0: The leaves connected to node 0 are 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- For central node 3: The leaves connected to node 3 are 2, 6, 7, and 9.
- For central node 7: The leaves connected to node 7 are 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9.
- For central node 9: The leaves connected to node 9 are 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>

[There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
