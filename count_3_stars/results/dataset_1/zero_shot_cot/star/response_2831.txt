Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 7), (0, 3, 9)
2. Node 1: None
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 9), (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 9), (2, 5, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 0, 4), (3, 0, 6), (3, 2, 4), (3, 2, 6), (3, 4, 6)
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 3), (4, 2, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 2, 8), (5, 2, 9)
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 1, 8)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 8)
9. Node 8: (8, 4, 5), (8, 4, 6), (8, 4, 7), (8, 4, 9), (8, 5, 6), (8, 5, 7), (8, 5, 9), (8, 6, 7), (8, 6, 9), (8, 7, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 2), (9, 0, 5), (9, 0, 8), (9, 2, 5), (9, 2, 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
