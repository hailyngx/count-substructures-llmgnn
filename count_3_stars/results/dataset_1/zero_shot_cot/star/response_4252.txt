Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in this graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes with their edges:
- Node 0: 6 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 1 edge
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 1 edge
- Node 7: 4 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 3 edges

Based on the number of edges, possible center nodes for 3-stars are 0, 1, 5, 7. Let's check the connections of these nodes to form the 3-stars:

1. For center node 0:
   - (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)
   <0, (2, 3, 5)>  [1 unique 3-star]

2. For center node 1:
   - (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9)
   <1, (5, 7, 8)> [1 unique 3-star]

3. For center node 5:
   - (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 9)
   <5, (0, 1, 7)> [1 unique 3-star]

4. For center node 7:
   - (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 5)
   <7, (0, 1, 5)> [1 unique 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, and <5, (0, 1, 7)>.
