Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 3, 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 7: 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2: (4, 6, 9) and (6, 4, 9) <2, (4, 6, 9)> or <2, (6, 4, 9)>
- Node 3: (1, 5, 6) <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: (2, 6, 9) and (6, 2, 9) <4, (2, 6, 9)> or <4, (6, 2, 9)>
- Node 6: (2, 4, 9), (2, 5, 9), (3, 4, 5) <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 9: (0, 2, 4) and (0, 2, 7) <9, (0, 2, 4)> or <9, (0, 2, 7)>

After counting all the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8]. 
The unique 3-stars are <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>.
