Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges
From the given edges, we identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 0 (connected to 2, 3, 4)
- Node 2 (connected to 0, 7, X)
- Node 3 (connected to 0, 1, 4)
- Node 4 (connected to 0, 3, X)
- Node 7 (connected to 2, X, X)
- Node 8 (connected to 3, X, X)
- Node 9 (connected to 5, X, X)

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars
Counting the 3-stars:

<b>1. (0, 2, 7) is a 3-star with the center at 0 and leaves at 2, 4, 7</b>
2. (0, 3, 4) is a 3-star with the center at 0 and leaves at 2, 3, 4
3. (3, 1, 8) is a 3-star with the center at 3 and leaves at 1, 4, 8
4. (5, 9, X) is a 3-star with the center at 5 and leaves at 9, X, X
