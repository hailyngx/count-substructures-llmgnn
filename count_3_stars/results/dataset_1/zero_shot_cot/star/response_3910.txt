Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-star structures. 

Observations:
1. The graph has 10 nodes which are numbered from 0 to 9.
2. The graph has 22 edges connecting different nodes.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 seems to be the center of a lot of potential 3-stars. Let's look at the nodes connected to node 2 to determine the 3-stars.

Possible 3-stars with center node 2: 
1. <2, (0, 1, 3)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [2]

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
