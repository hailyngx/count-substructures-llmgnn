Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the central node of each 3-star in the graph. 
Then, we list the leaves connected to each central node to identify unique 3-stars.
Let's start:

Central Node: 0
Leaves connected to 0: 2, 3, 9
<0, (2, 3, 9)>

Central Node: 2
Leaves connected to 2: 0, 3, 4, 7
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 0, 4)>
<2, (4, 0, 7)>

Central Node: 3
Leaves connected to 3: 0, 2, 6, 9
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<3, (2, 0, 9)>

Central Node: 4
Leaves connected to 4: 1, 2, 7
<4, (1, 2, 7)>

Central Node: 7
Leaves connected to 7: 2, 4, 8
<7, (2, 4, 8)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 0, 4)>, <2, (4, 0, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>.
