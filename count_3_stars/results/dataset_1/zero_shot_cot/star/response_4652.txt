Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph.

Given edges:
- (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6)
- (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9)
- (4, 1) (4, 8)
- (5, 6)
- (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8)
- (7, 2)
- (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6)
- (9, 2)

Let's count the number of 3-stars:
- [8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, -)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, -,-)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, -,-)>

So, the final answer is [8].
