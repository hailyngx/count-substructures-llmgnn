Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each possible combination where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
