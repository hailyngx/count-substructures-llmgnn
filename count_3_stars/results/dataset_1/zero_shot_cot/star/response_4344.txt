Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 0 since node 0 is the center of the 3-stars.  
Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.  

Now, for each node connected to node 0, we will check if a 3-star is formed by considering the nodes that are connected to both the center node and the current node.

For node 1:  
Nodes connected to both 0 and 1 are 4 and 8.  
Therefore, the 3-stars for node 1 are <0, (1, 4, 8)>.

For node 4:  
Nodes connected to both 0 and 4 are 1 and 8.  
Therefore, the 3-stars for node 4 are <0, (4, 1, 8)>.

For node 8:  
Nodes connected to both 0 and 8 are 1 and 4.  
Therefore, the 3-stars for node 8 are <0, (8, 1, 4)>.

In this graph, each central node (0) forms a unique 3-star with the connected nodes. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (4, 1, 8)>, <0, (8, 1, 4)>.
