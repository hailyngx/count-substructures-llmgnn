Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node to determine if they are the central node of a 3-star.

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star <0, (3, 7, 9)>.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 6 only. It is not part of any 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. This forms a 3-star <2, (1, 4, 5)>.

Checking node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 5)> and <3, (6, 7, 9)>.

Node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5. This forms a 3-star <4, (2, 3, 5)>.

Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9. This forms two 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 4)> and <5, (7, 9)>.

Node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 3. It is not part of any 3-star.

Node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5. This forms a 3-star <7, (0, 3, 5)>.

Node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9 only. It is not part of any 3-star.

Finally, checking node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8. This forms two 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)> and <9, (5, 6, 8)>.

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>
