Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list them uniquely, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly three edges connected to it. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <3, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (0)>
- <5, (0, 1)>
- <6, (2, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6)>
- <9, (7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
