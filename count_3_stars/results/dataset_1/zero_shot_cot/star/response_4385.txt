Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
