Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 as the central node: 
   <2, (4, 8, 9)>
2. Node 4 as the central node: 
   <4, (0, 2, 3)>
   <4, (7, 8, 9)>
3. Node 8 as the central node:
   <8, (1, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [5]
