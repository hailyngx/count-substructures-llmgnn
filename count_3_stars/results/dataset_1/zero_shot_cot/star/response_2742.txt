Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to find the number of 3-stars it contains.

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These can potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 connections: nodes 2 and 9.

Step 2: For each potential central node, identify the nodes that are connected to it. These nodes would be part of the 3-star if the central node forms one.

For node 2: (0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 9)
For node 9: (0, 1, 2, 5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed.

Unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (7, 2, 5)>

Step 4: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Total number of unique 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
