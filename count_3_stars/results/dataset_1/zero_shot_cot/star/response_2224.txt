Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-star structures one by one:

1. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 6, 8)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 5)>
4. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
5. <4, (3, 5, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 4)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
8. <8, (3, 5, 9)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
