Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
    - 3-star with center node 0: <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
    - 3-star with center node 1: <1, (0, 6, 7)>
    
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
    - 3-star with center node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>
    
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.
    - 3-star with center node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>
    
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
    - 3-star with center node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
    
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
    - 3-star with center node 8: <8, (0, 2, 3)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
