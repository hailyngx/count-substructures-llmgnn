Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's first list down all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, _)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [4].
