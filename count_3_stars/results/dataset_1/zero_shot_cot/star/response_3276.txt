Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3.
In the given graph, nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 3, 5, 9

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars using nodes with degree 3.
For each node with degree 3, we need to check if it forms a 3-star. 
Let's start with node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star <1, (2, 7, 9)>.

Next, node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6. Since node 6 does not have degree 3, node 3 cannot form a 3-star.

Then, node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. Since node 3 does not have degree 3, node 5 cannot form a 3-star.

Lastly, node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star <9, (1, 5, 6)>.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
The total number of 3-stars found is 2.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>.
