Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (7, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:
- Node 0: (2, 5, 6)
- Node 2: (0, 4, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 8)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>

There are in total 3 different 3-stars in the graph, so the answer is [3].
