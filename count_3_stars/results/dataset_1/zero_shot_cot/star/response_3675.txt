Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
2. Node 4 is connected to node 5.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 7 (duplicate edge).
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 9.
5. Node 8 is connected to node 2.
6. Node 9 is connected to node 7.

From the above information, we can see that there are three 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
