Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We are given that the graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. As a 3-star contains a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's identify all possible 3-stars within this graph:

1. For node 0: <0, (2, 7, 1)>
2. For node 1: <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. For node 2: <2, (0, 7, 1)>
4. For node 3: No 3-star found.
5. For node 4: No 3-star found.
6. For node 6: No 3-star found.
7. For node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
8. For node 8: <8, (1, 3, 4)>
9. For node 9: No 3-star found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
