Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the connections between nodes. Let's find the 3-stars one by one:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8) -> <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3) -> <1, (2, 3)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8) -> <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>
4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 6) -> <3, (0, 1, 2)> 
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7) -> <4, (0, 5, 6)>
6. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9) -> <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 9, 3)>
7. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 4) -> <6, (3, 4)>
8. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9) -> <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (9, 2, 4)>
9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5) -> <8, (0, 2, 5)>
10. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 7) -> <9, (5, 7)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars. So the final answer is [10].
