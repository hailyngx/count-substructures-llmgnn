Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes in the graph. The nodes with the highest degree will be the center nodes in a 3-star graph. In this case, node 5 has the highest degree of 5, making it the center node.

Next, let's find the leaves of the 3-star graphs connected to the center node (node 5). The nodes directly connected to the center node are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars: 
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
