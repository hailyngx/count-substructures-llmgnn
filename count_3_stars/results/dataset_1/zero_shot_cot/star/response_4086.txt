Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, and 8.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 7.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- For node 0: <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)> [4]
- For node 1: <1, (2, 6, 8)> [1]
- For node 3: <3, (0, 4, 8)> [1]
- For node 6: <6, (0, 1, 7)> [1]
- For node 7: <7, (0, 6, 9)> [1]
- For node 8: <8, (1, 3, 6)> [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
