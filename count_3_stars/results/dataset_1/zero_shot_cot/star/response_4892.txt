Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 6)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We will list the unique 3-stars as we find them:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
3. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
4. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
5. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
6. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
7. <3, (0, 2, 5)>
8. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
9. <5, (0, 3, 6)>
10. <5, (0, 3, 7)>
11. <5, (0, 3, 9)>
12. <5, (3, 6, 9)>
13. <5, (3, 7, 9)>
14. <5, (3, 9, 6)>
15. <6, (3, 5, 9)>
16. <9, (4, 5, 6)>
17. <9, (4, 5, 7)>
18. <9, (4, 5, 8)>
19. <9, (5, 6, 7)>
20. <9, (5, 6, 8)>
21. <9, (5, 7, 8)>
22. <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
