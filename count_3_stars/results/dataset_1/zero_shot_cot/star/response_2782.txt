Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that act as central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
