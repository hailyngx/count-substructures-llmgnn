Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-stars: 

1. The node degrees can be calculated as follows: 
    - Node 0: 1
    - Node 1: 1
    - Node 2: 1
    - Node 3: 1
    - Node 4: 4
    - Node 5: 3
    - Node 6: 2
    - Node 7: 5
    - Node 8: 2
    - Node 9: 4

2. Identify the nodes with a degree of 3 and check if they form a 3-star:
    - Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 6 forming <5, (3, 6, 6)>
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 7 forming <6, (5, 7, 7)>
    
Thus, there are two unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
