Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find all the 3-stars present in it.

### Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to each node
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 8
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: Connected to node 5
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 5
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 6
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 7

### Step 2: Find all 3-star configurations
1. **<0, (2, 8, 6)>**
2. **<1, (2, 4, 6)>**
3. **<1, (2, 6, 9)>**
4. **<2, (0, 1, 5)>**
5. **<2, (1, 5, 6)>**
6. **<2, (5, 3, 6)>**
7. **<5, (2, 3, 7)>**
8. **<5, (4, 1, 7)>**
9. **<6, (1, 2, 8)>**
10. **<7, (5, 9, 1)>**

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
