Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 1 as the center: (1, 5, 7), (1, 7, 8)
2. Node 2 as the center: (2, 1, 7), (2, 1, 8), (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 8)
3. Node 5 as the center: (5, 1, 7)
4. Node 7 as the center: (7, 1, 2), (7, 1, 5), (7, 2, 5), (7, 2, 8)
5. Node 8 as the center: (8, 1, 7), (8, 1, 2), (8, 9, 2)

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [12]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 7), (7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7), (1, 8)>, <2, (3, 7), (3, 8)>, <5, (1, 7)>, <7, (1, 2), (1, 5)>, <7, (2, 5), (2, 8)>, <8, (1, 7),  (1, 2)>, <8, (9, 2)> 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
