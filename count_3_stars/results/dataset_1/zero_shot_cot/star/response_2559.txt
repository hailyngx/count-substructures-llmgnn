Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to node 0 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are directly connected to node 0. 
    - Potential 3-stars involving node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 4, 5), (0, 9, 7), and (0, 9, 5).
    
Step 2: Identify nodes connected to node 1 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 0, 2, and 4 are directly connected to node 1.
    - Potential 3-stars involving node 1: (1, 0, 4).
    
Step 3: Identify nodes connected to node 2 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 1, 3, and 6 are directly connected to node 2.
    - No potential 3-star involving node 2 is found as it needs to have exactly 3 other nodes connected.

Step 4: Identify nodes connected to node 3 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 2, 4, 8, and 9 are directly connected to node 3.
    - Potential 3-stars involving node 3: (3, 2, 4), (3, 4, 8), and (3, 9, 4).
    
Step 5: Identify nodes connected to node 4 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 0, 1, 3, and 9 are directly connected to node 4.
    - Potential 3-stars involving node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 3, 9).

Step 6: Identify nodes connected to node 5 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 0 and 9 are directly connected to node 5.
    - No potential 3-star involving node 5 is found as it needs to have exactly 3 other nodes connected.

Step 7: Identify nodes connected to node 6 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 2 is directly connected to node 6.
    - No potential 3-star involving node 6 is found as it needs to have exactly 3 other nodes connected.

Step 8: Identify nodes connected to node 7 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 0 and 8 are directly connected to node 7.
    - No potential 3-star involving node 7 is found as it needs to have exactly 3 other nodes connected.

Step 9: Identify nodes connected to node 8 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 3 and 7 are directly connected to node 8.
    - No potential 3-star involving node 8 is found as it needs to have exactly 3 other nodes connected.

Step 10: Identify nodes connected to node 9 which form 3-stars.
    - Node 0, 3, 4, and 5 are directly connected to node 9.
    - Potential 3-stars involving node 9: (9, 0, 3) and (9, 3, 4).

Thus, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
    <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (3, 9, 4)>, <4, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (4, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 9, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
