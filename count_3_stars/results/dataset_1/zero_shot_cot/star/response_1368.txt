Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that create a 3-star. The central nodes need to have exactly three neighbors to form a 3-star.
Checking the given graph, we find the following central nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 5, 8)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 8, 9)

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars that can be formed:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (8, 9, -)>

As there are 4 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [4].
