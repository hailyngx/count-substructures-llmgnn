Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Remember that a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the edges provided, we see that the nodes with degree 3 are: 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9. We can now form the 3-stars based on these central nodes and their connected nodes.

From the information provided, we can form the following 3-stars:
- <2, (6, 9, -)>
- <3, (4, 5, -)>
- <7, (4, 9, -)>
- <8, (4, -, -)>
- <9, (2, 7, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 5 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
