Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: node 0, node 1, node 5, node 6, node 7, node 8, and node 9. These nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star. 

Next, let's go through each of these nodes and check if they form a 3-star with the adjacent nodes. 

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9. Thus, we have a 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 9)>. 

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 7. There are no other nodes connected to node 1.

Next, node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. Thus, we have a 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 6)>.

Proceeding to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9. There are no other nodes connected to node 6.

Moving on to node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9. Thus, we have a 3-star: <7, (1, 8, 9)>.

Next, node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7. There are no other nodes connected to node 8.

Lastly, node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7. Thus, we have a 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 7)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, and <7, (1, 8, 9)> 

The total number of 3-stars is [3].
