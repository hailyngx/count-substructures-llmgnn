Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. We can then form 3-stars with these nodes as the center. 

Let's identify the nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us [4].
