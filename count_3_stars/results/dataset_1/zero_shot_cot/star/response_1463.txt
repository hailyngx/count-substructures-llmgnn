Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8 (4 connections)
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9 (5 connections)
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9 (4 connections)
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8 (4 connections)

Step 2: From the list above, we can see that nodes 2, 5, 8, and 9 have the potential to form 3-stars. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (6, 5, 7)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [4].

Therefore, the answer is [4].
