Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars and then count them. 

First, identify the nodes that are directly connected to a particular central node. 

For each node, determine if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, form a 3-star with the central node and the three connected nodes.

Let's go step-by-step: 

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7. It forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 7)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 9. It does not form a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9. It does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8. It forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 5)>.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7. It forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 3, 7)>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9. It does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8. It does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3 and 7. It does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6. It does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 7)> and <5, (0, 3, 7)>.
