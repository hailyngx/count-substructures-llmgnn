Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 9, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
