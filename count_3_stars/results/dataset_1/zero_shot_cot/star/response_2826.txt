Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph based on the definition. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find all the possible 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (1, 2, 3, 7)
- Node 2: (0, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 4: (2, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (0, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 8: (4, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 1 unique 3-stars with the central node as node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- There are 2 unique 3-stars with the central node as node 2: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with the central node as node 4: <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with the central node as node 7: <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- There is 1 unique 3-star with the central node as node 8: <8, (4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
