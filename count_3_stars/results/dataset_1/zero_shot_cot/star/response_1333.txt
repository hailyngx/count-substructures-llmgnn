Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. The node with three outgoing edges will be considered as the center, and the nodes to which it is connected will be the leaves of the 3-star.

After examining the given graph, we find the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- <0, (6, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (7, 5, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
