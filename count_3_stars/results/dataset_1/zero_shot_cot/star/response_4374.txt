Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 7)>
<1, (3, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 5)>
<4, (0, 0, 7)>
<5, (3, 3, 3)>
<7, (0, 9, 9)>
<9, (7, 7, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
