Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

By observing the edges, we can see that there are two possible 3-stars in this graph:

1. <1, (2, 3, 8)>
2. <6, (3, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
