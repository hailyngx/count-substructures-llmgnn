Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Node 1 has three edges with nodes 0, 2, and 9: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
2. Node 2 has three edges with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <2, (1, 5, 8)>
3. Node 5 has three edges with nodes 2, 4, and 7: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
4. Node 8 has three edges with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <8, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
