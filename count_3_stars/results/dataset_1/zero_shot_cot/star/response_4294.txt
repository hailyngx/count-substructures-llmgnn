Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 7, -)>
<9, (2, 4, -)>

Next, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[9]
