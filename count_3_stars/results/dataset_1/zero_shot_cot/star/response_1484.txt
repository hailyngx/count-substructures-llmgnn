Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars that can be found in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
