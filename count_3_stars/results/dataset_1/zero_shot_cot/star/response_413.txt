Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are the center of 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star has the center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find the nodes with degree 3.

From the given edge list, the degrees of each node are:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 5

So, the nodes with degree 3 are nodes 1 and 9.

Next, we need to find the neighbors of these nodes and check if they form 3-stars. For node 1, its neighbors are nodes 2, 7, and 8. However, there is no 3-star centered at node 1 since there are no two nodes among nodes 2, 7, and 8 that are also neighbors.

For node 9, its neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7. We can see that we have two 3-stars centered at node 9, with the following configurations:
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2], and the unique 3-stars found are <9, (2, 3, 6)> and <9, (2, 6, 7)>.
