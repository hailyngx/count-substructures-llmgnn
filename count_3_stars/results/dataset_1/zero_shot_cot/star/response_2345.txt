Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes in the given graph. 

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is linked to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 3 is linked to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 5 is linked to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 7 is linked to nodes 0, 3, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-star motifs:

[<0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
