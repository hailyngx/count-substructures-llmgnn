Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes will be the nodes with exactly three incident edges. From the given edges, we can determine that nodes 0, 4, and 6 are the central nodes in the graph.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star is formed by the central node and its neighboring nodes. 

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 4:
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 6:
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (4, 7, 0)>

Combining all unique 3-stars, we get:
[<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>] 

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
