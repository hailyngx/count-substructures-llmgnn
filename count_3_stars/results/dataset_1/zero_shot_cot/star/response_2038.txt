Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to other nodes in a 3-star pattern. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

Looking at the given edges, we see the following possible center nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 8, 9)>

For Node 1:
- <1, (0, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5)>

For Node 5:
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (5, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
