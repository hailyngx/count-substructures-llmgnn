Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars.

By examining the given edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Center node 2:
   - <2, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   
2. Center node 3:
   - <3, (2, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (6, 7, 8)>

3. Center node 6:
   - <6, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (3, 5, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7. 
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
