Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
Node 2: 1, 4
Node 3: 1, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 2
Node 5: 1, 3, 8
Node 6: 3, 7
Node 7: 6
Node 8: 0, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 3)> and <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The final answer is [4].
