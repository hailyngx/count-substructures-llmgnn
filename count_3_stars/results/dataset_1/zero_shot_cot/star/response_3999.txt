Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that connects with exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars identified in the graph:

1. <4, (1, 8, 9)>
2. <6, (7, 8, 9)>
3. <7, (6, 8, 9)>
4. <8, (4, 6, 7)>
5. <9, (4, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars identified in the graph and put the final answer inside brackets [].
