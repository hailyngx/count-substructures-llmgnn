Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
