Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique set of nodes that form 3-stars. Here's the breakdown step-by-step:

1. For each node in the graph, identify its neighbors. Based on the given edges:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.

2. Identify 3-star combinations:
   - From the neighbor lists, we can see that Node 2 can form 3-star combinations with (0, 4, 8), (3, 6, 7), and (9, 4, 8). These are the only 3-star configurations in this graph.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: 
   - <2, (0, 4, 8)>
   - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <2, (9, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
