Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Start by identifying nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 5, and 6.
   - Node 5 has edges with nodes 0, 1, and 3.
   - Node 7 has edges with nodes 2, 6, and 8.
   - Node 8 has edges with nodes 4, 7, and 9.
   
2. Next, check if these nodes form 3-stars by having exactly three edges among them:
   - Nodes 3, 5, and 6 do not form a 3-star as node 6 is not connected to nodes 3 and 5.
   - Nodes 5, 0, and 1 do not form a 3-star as node 0 is not connected to nodes 5 and 1.
   - Nodes 7, 2, and 8 do not form a 3-star as node 2 is not connected to nodes 7 and 8.
   - Nodes 8, 4, and 9 form a 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 4 and 9 as the leaves.
   
3. Count the number of 3-stars found:  
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is <8, (4, 9)>.
