Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars we find:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
