Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 7, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, -, -)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, -)>
<8, (6, -, -)>
<9, (0, -, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
