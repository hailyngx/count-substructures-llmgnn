Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Central nodes (nodes with exactly three incident edges):
   - Node 0 is connected to 4, 7, and 8.
   - Node 1 is connected to 0, 3, and 4.
   - Node 4 is connected to 0, 1, and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to 0, 4, and 5.
   - Node 9 is connected to 2, 4, and 6.

2. Counting the number of unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <9, (2, 4, 6)>

3. Final Answer: There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
