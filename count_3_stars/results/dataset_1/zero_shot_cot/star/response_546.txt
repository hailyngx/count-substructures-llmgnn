Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 8)
   - <0, (3, 5, 6)>

2. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 9)
   - <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (7, 9, 0)>

3. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6)
   - <2, (1, 3, 6)>

4. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9)
   - <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (4, 9, 0)>

5. Node 1: (1, 2) - Does not form a 3-star.

6. Node 4: (4, 6) - Does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 9)
   - <5, (0, 9, 0)>

8. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 9) - Does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 8: (8, 0) - Does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)
   - <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (7, 0, 6)>

Therefore, we have found the following unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (7, 9, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (4, 9, 0)>, <5, (0, 9, 0)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (7, 0, 6)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
