Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the central nodes and the leaves connected to them. 

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:
1. Identify the nodes which have exactly three neighbors. These nodes will represent the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each of these central nodes, identify the three neighbors connected to them.

Let's go through the graph to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, and 5.
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 6.
  - <4, (0, 5, 6)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 4.
  - <5, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)> [3]
