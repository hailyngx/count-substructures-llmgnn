Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph based on the definition provided.

Based on the edges provided, we observe the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (0, 2, 4)> - where node 1 is the center, and nodes 0, 2, and 4 are the leaves.
2. <6, (5, 7, 7)> - where node 6 is the center, and nodes 5, 7, and 7 are the leaves.
3. <8, (3, 4, 8)> - where node 8 is the center, and nodes 3, 4, and 8 are the leaves.
4. <9, (1, 2, 1)> - where node 9 is the center, and nodes 1, 2, and 1 are the leaves.

Count of 3-star graphs: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 7, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 1)>
