Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph along with the central node and the leaf nodes:

<0, (2, 5, 7)>  
<1, (4, 8, 9)>  
<3, (6, 7, 8)>  
<7, (0, 3, 8)>  
<8, (1, 7, 9)>  
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
