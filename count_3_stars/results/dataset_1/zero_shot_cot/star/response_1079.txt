Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can identify all the nodes to see which nodes have exactly three edges connected to them. Then, we can check if those nodes form a 3-star. Let's start by finding the nodes with three edges connected to them:  

Node 0: 3 edges  
Node 1: 4 edges  
Node 2: 2 edges  
Node 3: 5 edges  
Node 4: 2 edges  
Node 5: 5 edges  
Node 6: 4 edges  
Node 7: 4 edges  
Node 8: 5 edges  
Node 9: 2 edges  

Based on the given information, we can see that nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8 have exactly three edges connected to them, meaning they can serve as the center of a 3-star. Let's examine each of them to identify the 3-star configurations:  

For Node 0:
- (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8)
<0, (1, 5, 8)>

For Node 3:
- (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7)
<3, (2, 5, 7)>

For Node 5:
- (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3)
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
- (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8)
<5, (6, 7, 8)>

For Node 8:
- (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3)
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
- (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3)
<8, (4, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
