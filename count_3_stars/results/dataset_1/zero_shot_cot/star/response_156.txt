Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, -)>
<6, (2, 5, -)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [7].
