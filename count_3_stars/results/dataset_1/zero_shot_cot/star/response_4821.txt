Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 5)>
2. <4, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <5, (0, 2, 9)>
4. <7, (3, 4, 5)>
5. <8, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
