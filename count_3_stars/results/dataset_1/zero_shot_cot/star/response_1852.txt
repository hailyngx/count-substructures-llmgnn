Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6) creates the 3-star <1, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8) creates the 3-star <2, (6, 7, 8)>
3. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 9) creates the 3-star <3, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 9) creates the 3-star <5, (1, 6, 9)>
5. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5) creates the 3-star <6, (1, 2, 5)>
6. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 9) creates the 3-star <8, (2, 3, 9)>
7. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8) creates the 3-star <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [7].
