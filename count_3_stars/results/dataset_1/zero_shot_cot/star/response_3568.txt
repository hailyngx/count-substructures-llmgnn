Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

To simplify the process, let's first list all the nodes along with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 1, 7, 8
- Node 3: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's identify the 3-star patterns. Based on the neighbors of each node, we can find the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
3. <3, (1, 5, 8)>
4. <4, (1, 8, 0)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
6. <7, (2, 8, 1)>
7. <9, (3, 5, 8)>

There are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
