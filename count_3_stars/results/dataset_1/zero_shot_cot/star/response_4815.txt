Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
