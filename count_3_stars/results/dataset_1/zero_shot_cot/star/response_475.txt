Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with 3 neighbors.  
    Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 6

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if the 3 neighbors are connected to each other.  
    For node 0: (1, 2, 3) - NOT a 3-star
    For node 2: (0, 6, 7) - <2, (0, 6, 7)>
    For node 3: (0, 6, 9) - NOT a 3-star
    For node 6: (2, 3, 7) - <6, (2, 3, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.  
    Total number of 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>.
