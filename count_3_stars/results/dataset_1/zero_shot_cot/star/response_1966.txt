Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Central node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)> 
3. Central node 3: <3, (1, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [3].
