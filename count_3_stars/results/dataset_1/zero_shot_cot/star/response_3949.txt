Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided earlier. 

First, let's list the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: 3, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7
- Node 9: 6, 7

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3: (0, 2, 5), (0, 7, 8), (2, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (5, 7, 3)
- Node 6: (2, 7, 9)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 5), (3, 6, 9), (4, 6, 9)

Hence, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
