Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
