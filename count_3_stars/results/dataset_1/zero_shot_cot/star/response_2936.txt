Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes in a 3-star graph will have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 4, and 8 have 2 edges connected to them, while all other nodes have more than 3 edges connected to them. This means nodes 0, 4, and 8 are potential central nodes.

Now, let's check if they form 3-stars by having 3 edges connected to them. If they do, we will count those as 3-stars.

- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 5), (5, 0) - forms a 3-star <0, (2, 5)>.
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7) - forms a 3-star <4, (3, 5, 7)>.
- Node 8: (8, 5) - does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are two 3-stars in the given graph. 

So the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 5)> and <4, (3, 5, 7)>.
