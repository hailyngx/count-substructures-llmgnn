Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we start by identifying each unique 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 9, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 8)>
<2, (0, 9, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Now, we count the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star in the graph:
- <0, (2, 9, 9)> appears twice.
- <1, (4, 8, 8)> appears once.
- <2, (0, 9, 9)> appears twice.
- <4, (1, 8, 8)> appears once.
- <6, (7, 9, 9)> appears once.
- <8, (1, 5, 8)> appears once.
- <9, (0, 2, 6)> appears once.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
