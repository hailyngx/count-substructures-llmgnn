Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the list of edges, we can see that nodes 7, 8, and 9 are directly connected to the central node 0. 
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[There are a total of 3 3-stars in the given graph.]

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
