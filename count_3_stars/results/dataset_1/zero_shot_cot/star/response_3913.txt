Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: 3rd neighbor (4, 6, 9)
- Node 2: No 3-stars
- Node 3: 3rd neighbor (1, 5, 7)
- Node 4: 3rd neighbor (6, 9, 1)
- Node 5: 3rd neighbor (1, 3, 6)
- Node 6: 3rd neighbor (0, 1, 3)
- Node 7: No 3-stars
- Node 9: No 3-stars

So, the unique 3-star configurations are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>

Thus, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
