Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes with their connected neighbors are:
- Node 0: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 6
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
From the given edges, the 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 
<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 0)>
