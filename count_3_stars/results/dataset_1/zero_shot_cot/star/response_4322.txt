Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list down the 3-star configurations:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>

As we can see, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
