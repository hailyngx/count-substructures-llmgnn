Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in a star pattern. 

Let's start by listing all unique 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (5, 8, 1)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get the final answer: [2].
