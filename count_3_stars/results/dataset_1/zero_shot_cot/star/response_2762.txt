Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the nodes that are connected to 3 other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, 9)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 8, 9)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 3, 7, 9)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 6, 7)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5)

Step 2: List the 3-stars using the identified potential center nodes.

Potential 3-stars centered at node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 7)>
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
[3]

Potential 3-stars centered at node 1:
- <1, (0, 8, 9)>
[1]

Potential 3-stars centered at node 4:
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
[1]

Potential 3-stars centered at node 7:
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
[1]

Potential 3-stars centered at node 8:
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
[1]

Potential 3-stars centered at node 9:
- <9, (0, 4, 5)>
[1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
