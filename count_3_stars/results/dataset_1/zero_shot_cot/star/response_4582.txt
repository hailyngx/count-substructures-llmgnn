Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming possible 3-stars.
    
    - Node 0 is connected to: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 (5 nodes)
    - Node 1 is connected to: 0, 8 (2 nodes)
    - Node 2 is connected to: 6 (1 node)
    - Node 3 is connected to: 0, 5 (2 nodes)
    - Node 4 is connected to: 5, 6, 7 (3 nodes)
    - Node 5 is connected to: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9 (5 nodes)
    - Node 6 is connected to: 0, 2, 4, 7 (4 nodes)
    - Node 7 is connected to: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9 (5 nodes)
    - Node 8 is connected to: 1, 9 (2 nodes)
    - Node 9 is connected to: 5, 7, 8 (3 nodes)
    
Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

    - From the list above, we can see that only node 0 and node 5 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.
    
    - For Node 0, the possible 3-stars are:
        <0, (1, 3, 5)>
        <0, (1, 6, 7)>
        <0, (3, 5, 6)>
        <0, (5, 6, 7)>
        
    - For Node 5, the possible 3-stars are:
        <5, (0, 3, 4)>
        <5, (0, 4, 7)>
        
Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

    - Total number of unique 3-stars: 5
