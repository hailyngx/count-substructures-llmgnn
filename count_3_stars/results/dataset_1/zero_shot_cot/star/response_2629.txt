Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 8, -)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, -, -)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, -)>
<9, (0, 7, -)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
