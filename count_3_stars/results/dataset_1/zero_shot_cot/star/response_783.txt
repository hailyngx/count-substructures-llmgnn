Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to count the number of 3-stars it contains.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7: <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 9: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 4: <3, (6, 9, 4)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6: <5, (0, 4, 6)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 5: <6, (0, 3, 5)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9: <8, (2, 4, 9)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <9, (3, 4, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
