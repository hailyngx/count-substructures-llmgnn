Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star-like structure. 

From the provided edge list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 8)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 7)>
5. <6, (0, 2, 7)>
6. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
7. <8, (3, 7, 9)>
8. <9, (2, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
