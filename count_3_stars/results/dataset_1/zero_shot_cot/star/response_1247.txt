Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 3, 4
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 7

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations in the graph:

<0, (1, 9, _)>  
<1, (0, 9, _)>  
<2, (4, 7, 9)>  
<4, (2, 5, 6)>  
<7, (2, 8, 9)>  

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
