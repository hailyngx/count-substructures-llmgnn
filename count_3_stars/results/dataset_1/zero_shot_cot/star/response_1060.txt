Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, node 1, and node 6 since these can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

1. For node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6. This forms one 3-star: <0, (1, 6)>.
    
2. For node 1:
    - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. 
    - This results in no 3-stars because there are no sets of 3 nodes connected to node 1 such that they form a 3-star.

3. For node 6:
    - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9.
    - This results in one more 3-star: <6, (0, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6)> and <6, (0, 3, 5)>.
