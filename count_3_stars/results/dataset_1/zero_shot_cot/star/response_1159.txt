Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes.

1. Central node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Central node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. Central node 2: <2, (8, 9)>
4. Central node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)>
5. Central node 5: <5, (0, 1, 7)>
6. Central node 8: <8, (0, 1, 2)>
7. Central node 9: <9, (2, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get:

[7]
