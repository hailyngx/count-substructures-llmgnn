Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star in the graph. Since a 3-star requires the center node to be connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3.

From the given edges, we can determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 1

Nodes 3, 6, and 7 are the only nodes with degree 3, so these are the potential centers of the 3-stars.

Now, let's consider each potential center node and identify the 3-stars:
1. For node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 7.

2. For node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.

3. For node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in the graph.
