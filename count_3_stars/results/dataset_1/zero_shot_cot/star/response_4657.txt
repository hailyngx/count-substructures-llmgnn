Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Next, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
- Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the final answer is: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
