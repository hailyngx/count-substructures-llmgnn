Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Then we can form unique 3-stars and count them. 

The central nodes along with their adjacent nodes are as follows:
- Node 1: (2, 3, 4)
- Node 2: (1, 4, 6)
- Node 3: (1, 6, 7)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 7)
- Node 5: (7, 8)
- Node 6: (2, 3, 8)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 8: (5, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (0, 7, 8)

Now let's form the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (7, 8)> 

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
