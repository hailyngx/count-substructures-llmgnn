Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes with three adjacent edges. 

Based on the given edges, the nodes with three adjacent edges are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 4)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 6)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 6)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 5)

Next, we need to count how many different 3-stars can be formed in this graph. Let's count them and then list them:
- 3-stars with center node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- 3-stars with center node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- 3-stars with center node 4: <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- 3-star with center node 5: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- 3-star with center node 6: <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count how many unique 3-stars we have found and put the final answer inside brackets:
