Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 in the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.

Now, we can form 3-star graphs with node 0 as the center and the nodes that are connected to it as leaves:
1. <0, (4, 8, 9)>
2. <0, (4, 1, 3)>
3. <0, (8, 6, 9)>

Hence, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
