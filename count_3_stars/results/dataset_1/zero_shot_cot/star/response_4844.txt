Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (1, 7, 0)>
<5, (1, 0, 0)>
<6, (0, 0, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
