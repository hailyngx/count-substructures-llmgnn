Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph: 

- The central node with degree `3` is node `0`. The three nodes connected to node `0` are nodes `7`, `8`, and `9`. Therefore, the <0, (7, 8, 9)> is a 3-star. 

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and output the final answer inside brackets:
