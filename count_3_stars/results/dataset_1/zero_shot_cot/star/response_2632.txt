Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes with edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.

2. Create unique 3-stars using the above information:
   - <0, (3, 5, 7)> (Center node: 0, Leaves: 3, 5, 7)
   - <2, (3, 4)> (Center node: 2, Leaves: 3, 4)
   - <4, (2, 6, 7)> (Center node: 4, Leaves: 2, 6, 7)
   - <7, (0, 4, 6)> (Center node: 7, Leaves: 0, 4, 6)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: 
   - [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
