Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

- Node 0 is connected to 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to 0.
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to 0 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 7 and 8.

Based on the connections above, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
