Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges.  
In this case, we need to find the nodes that are connected to node 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9 with exactly three edges each.  

For node 0, the nodes connected to it are 2 and 9.  
For node 1, the nodes connected to it are 5, 7, and 8.  
For node 2, the nodes connected to it are 0, 4, and 6.  
For node 7, the nodes connected to it are 1, 3, and 8.  
For node 9, the nodes connected to it are 0, 4, and 7.  

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars formed.  
Let's now count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
