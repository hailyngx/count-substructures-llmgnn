Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

We can see that the center of the 3-star must have degree 3, as it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
3. <4, (2, 9, None)>
4. <5, (3, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (5, 7, None)>
6. <7, (5, 6, None)>
7. <8, (0, 2, None)>
8. <9, (0, 2, 4)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [8].
