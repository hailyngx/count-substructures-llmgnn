Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. Node 1: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
3. Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 8)>
4. Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 7)>
5. Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 4)>
6. Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 4)>
7. Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
