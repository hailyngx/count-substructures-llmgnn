Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes with three connections (degree 3) as potential centers for 3-stars. In this graph, node 7 meets this criterion as it has degree 5, which is greater than two. 

Now, let's go through each neighboring node of node 7 to see if they form a 3-star. 
- Node 0: (7, 0, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (7, 2, 3)
- Node 3: (7, 3, 2)
- Node 4: (7, 4, 9)
- Node 9: (7, 9, 1, 4, 6, 8)

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 3)>
<7, (4, 9)>
<7, (9, 1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
