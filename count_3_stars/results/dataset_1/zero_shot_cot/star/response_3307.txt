Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9) -> One 3-star found <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9) -> One 3-star found <1, (3, 5, 8)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0) -> No 3-star
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7) -> One 3-star found <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 8) -> No 3-star
6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 9) -> One 3-star found <5, (1, 4, 8)>
7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 3) -> No 3-star
8. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9) -> One 3-star found <7, (3, 8, 9)>
9. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7) -> One 3-star found <8, (1, 4, 5)>
10. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 7) -> One 3-star found <9, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
