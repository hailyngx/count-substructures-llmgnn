Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the graph, let's first list out all the potential 3-stars based on the given edges:
1. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 9, x)>
3. <2, (1, 3, x)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 7, x)>
6. <5, (8, x, x)>
7. <6, (7, 8, x)>
8. <7, (0, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (0, 5, 6)>
10. <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Now, we can see that the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 9, x)>
<2, (1, 3, x)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (8, x, x)>
<6, (7, 8, x)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
