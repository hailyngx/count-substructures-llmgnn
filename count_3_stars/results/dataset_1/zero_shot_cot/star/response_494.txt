Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 2)>
<9, (2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
