Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Given the edges: 
- (0, 3), (3, 0)
- (2, 7), (7, 2)
- (3, 6), (6, 3), (3, 9), (9, 3), (6, 9), (9, 6)
- (5, 7), (7, 5)

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 9, 6)>
<5, (7, 2, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 4 3-stars in total. 

So, the final answer is [4].
