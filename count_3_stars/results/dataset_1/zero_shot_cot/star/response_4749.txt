Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 4, 8, 9
Node 1: 3, 8
Node 2: 5, 8
Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 3, 9
Node 5: 2, 6
Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 9
Node 7: 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 7
Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 0)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
