Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (6, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we get [7].
