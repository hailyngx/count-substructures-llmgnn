Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding three leaves.

Given the graph's edges, let's find the 3-stars:

1. Central Node 0: 
    Leaves: (1, 4)
    
2. Central Node 1:
    Leaves: (0, 6)
    
3. Central Node 4:
    Leaves: (0, 2, 3)

4. Central Node 5:
    Leaves: (4, 6, 7)

5. Central Node 6:
    Leaves: (1, 5, 9)

6. Central Node 9:
    Leaves: (5, 6)

Based on the identified 3-stars, the unique ones are:
<0, (1, 4)>
<1, (0, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
