Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.  
Nodes 3, 4, and 8 have exactly three edges connected to other nodes.  

Step 2: For each of the identified nodes, check if they form a 3-star with the connected nodes.  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8.  
  - Node 2, 4, and 8 form a 3-star: <3, (2, 4, 8)>  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8.  
  - Node 2, 3, and 8 form a 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 8)>  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.  
  - Node 1, 3, and 4 form a 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 4)>  

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.  
There are 3 unique 3-stars: <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, and <8, (1, 3, 4)>.
