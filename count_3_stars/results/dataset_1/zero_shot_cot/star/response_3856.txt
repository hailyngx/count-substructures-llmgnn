Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's first list down all the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (8, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 1, 6)>
<3, (6, _, _)>
<4, (5, 8, _)>
<5, (4, _, _)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, _)>
<8, (0, 4, _)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph by counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
