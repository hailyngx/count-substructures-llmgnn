Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, -)>
<2, (0, 1, -)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, -)>
<5, (8, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 4, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (3, 5, -)>
<9, (3, 5, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
