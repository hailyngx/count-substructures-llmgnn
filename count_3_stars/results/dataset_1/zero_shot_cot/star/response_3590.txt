Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify the central nodes in the graph. Since each 3-star contains a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3.

By examining the edges given, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 5, and 7 have a degree of 3, making them potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For central node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. For central node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)> and <1, (5, 9, 9)>
3. For central node 5: <5, (1, 3, 9)> and <5, (3, 1, 9)>
4. For central node 7: <7, (0, 3, 9)> and <7, (3, 0, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (5, 9, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 9)>, and <7, (3, 0, 9)>.
