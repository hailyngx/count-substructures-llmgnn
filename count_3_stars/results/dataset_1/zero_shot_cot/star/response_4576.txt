Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 

1. Node 0 has the neighbors 1, 2, and 8.  
2. Node 1 has the neighbors 0 and 9.  
3. Node 2 has the neighbors 0, 3, and 9.  
4. Node 3 has the neighbors 2 and 4.  
5. Node 4 has the neighbors 3 and 7.  
6. Node 5 has the neighbors 6 and 9.  
7. Node 6 has the neighbor 5.  
8. Node 7 has the neighbor 4.  
9. Node 8 has the neighbors 0 and 9.  
10. Node 9 has the neighbors 1, 2, 5, and 8.  

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 9, 2)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 7, -)>
<5, (6, 9, -)>
<6, (5, -, -)>
<8, (0, 9, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
