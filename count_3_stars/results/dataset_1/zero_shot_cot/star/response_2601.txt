Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, it does not form a 3-star as it has four connections.

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 4. (1, (0, 3, 4))

3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. However, it does not form a 3-star as it doesn't have enough connections.

4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4. (3, (0, 1, 4))

5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 1. (4, (0, 3, 1))

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9. However, it does not form a 3-star as it doesn't have enough connections.

7. Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 do not participate in any 3-stars based on the given connections.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 3, 1)>
