Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. We will then count how many such 3-stars exist.

There are two 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:<br>
<0, (3, 5, 7)> <br>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
