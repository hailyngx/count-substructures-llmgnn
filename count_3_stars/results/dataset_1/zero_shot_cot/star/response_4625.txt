Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, -)>
<1, (0, 5, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 7, -)>
<5, (0, 1, -)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, -, -)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, we can count the total number of 3-stars as [9].
