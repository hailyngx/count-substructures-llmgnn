Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges.

Let's list down the possible 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 0)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 2, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (8, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
