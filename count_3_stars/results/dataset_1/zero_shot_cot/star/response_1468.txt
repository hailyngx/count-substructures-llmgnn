Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 9.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - The 3-star patterns are:
     <1, (2, 6, 7)>
     <2, (1, 7, 9)>
     <7, (1, 2, 9)>
     <8, (0, 3, 6)>
     <9, (2, 7, 8)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - There are 5 unique 3-stars identified.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
