Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the unique 3-stars present:

- <0, (3, 8, -)>
- <2, (3, 5, -)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (2, 6, -)>
- <6, (3, 5, -)>
- <8, (0, 3, -)>
- <9, (3, -,-)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
