Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes with exactly 3 edges.  
- Node 2 has degree 4, so it can be a central node.  
- Node 4 has degree 3, so it can be a central node.  
- Node 7 has degree 5, so it can be a central node.  
- Node 8 has degree 5, so it can be a central node.  

Step 2: For each potential central node, identify its adjacent nodes to form a 3-star.  
- For node 2: {(2, 5, 9), (2, 7, 8)}  
- For node 4: {(4, 0, 8), (4, 7, 8)}  
- For node 7: {(7, 0, 1), (7, 2, 8)}  
- For node 8: {(8, 3, 6), (8, 4, 7)}  

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:  
<2, (5, 9, 2)>  
<2, (7, 8, 2)>  
<4, (0, 8, 4)>  
<7, (0, 1, 7)>  

[There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.]
