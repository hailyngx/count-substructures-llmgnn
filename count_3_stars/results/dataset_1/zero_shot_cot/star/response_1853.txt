Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (3, 2, 9)>
<0, (6, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 0, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 0, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars found, we have found [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
