Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their corresponding neighbors based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 5
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node and three other nodes that are connected directly to the center node.

We can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 9 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
