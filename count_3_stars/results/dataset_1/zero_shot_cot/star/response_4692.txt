Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their neighbors. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three neighbors. 
Based on the given edges, we can identify the following central nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0 (neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 4, 8)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 4, 9)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 1, 9)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 6)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 0, 1, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[Count: 6]

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (8, 0, 3)>
