Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star. These nodes are the ones connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the edges provided, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

1. For node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9)
   <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>

2. For node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
   <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>

3. For node 5: (5, 4), (5, 6)
   <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>

4. For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7)
   <6, (1, 5, 7)>

5. For node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)
   <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
