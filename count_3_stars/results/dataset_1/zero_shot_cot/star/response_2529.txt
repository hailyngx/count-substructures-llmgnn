Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 0, node 1, and node 2 respectively as per the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.

Now, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for the central node and its connected nodes. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
