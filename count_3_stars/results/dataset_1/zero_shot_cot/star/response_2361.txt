Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star configuration.

Let's analyze the connections for each node:

- Node 0 is connected to 2 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to 9.
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to 8 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <5, (0, 1, 9)>
6. <6, (3, 8, 9)>
7. <8, (2, 3, 9)>
8. <9, (4, 5, 6)>
9. <9, (7, 8, 4)>
10. <9, (7, 8, 6)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is: [10].
