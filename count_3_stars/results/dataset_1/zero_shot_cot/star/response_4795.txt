Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, (2, 4, 6))
2. Node 4: (4, (1, 3, 7))
3. Node 6: (6, (0, 1, 8))
4. Node 8: (8, (1, 6))
5. Node 9: (9, (0, 1, 3))

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>
