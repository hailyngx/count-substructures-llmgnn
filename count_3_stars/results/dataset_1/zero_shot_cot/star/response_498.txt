Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them.

Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors connected to it (nodes 2 and 5)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors connected to it (nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors connected to it (nodes 0, 1, and 4)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors connected to it (nodes 6, 7, and 8)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors connected to it (nodes 1, 2, and 7)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors connected to it (nodes 0, 1)
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor connected to it (node 3)
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors connected to it (nodes 3, 4)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors connected to it (nodes 3, 4)
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor connected to it (node 1)

Therefore, the central nodes in this graph are nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Let's now find the 3-stars with these central nodes:

<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 1, 7)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, which are listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
