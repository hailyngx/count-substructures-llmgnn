Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 9: <6, (0, 8, 9)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
5. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <9, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
