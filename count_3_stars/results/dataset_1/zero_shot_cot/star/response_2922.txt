Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star.
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. Node 2: <2, (6, 7, 8)>
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 7, 9)>
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
6. Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 4)>
7. Node 6: <6, (2, 9, 7)>
8. Node 7: Not a central node of a 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a central node of a 3-star.
10. Node 9: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, and <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
