Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star pattern. A 3-star pattern consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edge list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 9, -)>
<4, (5, 7, -)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, -)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 9, -)>
<9, (3, 8, -)>

Counting the unique 3-star patterns, we find that there are 10 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
