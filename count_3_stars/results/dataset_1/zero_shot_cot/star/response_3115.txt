Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. 

For the given graph:
- Node 3 has edges connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 has edges connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 8 has edges connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
