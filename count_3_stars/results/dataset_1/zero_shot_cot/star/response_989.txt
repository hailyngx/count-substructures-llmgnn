Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
