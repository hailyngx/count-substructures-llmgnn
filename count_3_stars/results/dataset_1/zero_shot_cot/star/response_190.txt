Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. (0, 2, 7)
2. (1, 2, 3)
3. (2, 3, 4)
4. (2, 5, 7)
5. (2, 6, 3)

So, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
