Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star present. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars by identifying the central node and the adjacent nodes. 

1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <3, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <6, (1, 7, 9)>
4. <7, (3, 6, 9)>
5. <8, (2, 4, 6)>
6. <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
