Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes and their connections in the given graph.

The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's look for 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4) => <0, (2, 4)>
- For node 1: (1, 3) => <1, (3)>
- For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 8) => <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- For node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9) => <3, (1, 4, 8), <3, (1, 8, 9)>
- For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8) => <4, (0, 2, 3), <4, (0, 2, 5), <4, (0, 2, 7), <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- For node 5: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8) => <5, (4, 7, 8)>
- For node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9) => <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- For node 8: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5) => <8, (2, 3, 4), <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- For node 9: (9, 3), (9, 7) => <9, (3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (2, 4)>
<1, (3)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
