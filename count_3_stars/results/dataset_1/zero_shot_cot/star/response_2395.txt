Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all potential central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2. (0, 1), (0, 2)
- Central node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8. (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- Central node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. (2, 0), (2, 3)
- Central node 3 is connected to node 2. (3, 2)
- Central node 4 is connected to node 5. (4, 5)
- Central node 5 is connected to node 4. (5, 4)
- Central node 6 is connected to node 7. (6, 7)
- Central node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9. (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 9)
- Central node 8 is connected to node 1. (8, 1)
- Central node 9 is connected to node 7. (9, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, -)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, -)>
<4, (5, - , -)>
<6, (7, - , -)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
