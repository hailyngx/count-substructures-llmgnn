Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of 3 nodes where one of them is connected to the other two. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges.

Let's start by identifying the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges:
- Node 8 has 3 incident edges: {(1, 8), (8, 3), (8, 7)}
- Node 7 has 2 incident edges: {(3, 7), (7, 8)}

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
