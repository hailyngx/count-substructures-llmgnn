Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are incident to edges. This step will help us visualize the graph better.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

Next, we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Total number of 3-stars = [4]

<0, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
