Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is the central node and nodes 0, 5, and 6 are the leaves. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
2. Node 2 is the central node and nodes 3, 5, and 7 are the leaves. <2, (3, 5, 7)>
3. Node 3 is the central node and nodes 1, 2, and 7 are the leaves. <3, (1, 2, 7)>
4. Node 5 is the central node and nodes 0, 2, and 6 are the leaves. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
5. Node 6 is the central node and nodes 1, 5, and 9 are the leaves. <6, (1, 5, 9)>
6. Node 7 is the central node and nodes 2, 3, and 9 are the leaves. <7, (2, 3, 9)>
7. Node 9 is the central node and nodes 5, 6, and 7 are the leaves. <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the final answer is [7].
