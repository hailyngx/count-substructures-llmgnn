Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
