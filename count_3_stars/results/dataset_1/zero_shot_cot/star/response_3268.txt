Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-star structures in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-star structures:

<0, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 7, -)>
<4, (1, -, -)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (5, 7, -)>
