Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7 <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 5 <1, (2, 3, 5)>
3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 6 <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8 <3, (1, 4, 8)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 5 <4, (0, 2, 5)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6 <5, (1, 4, 6)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 9 <6, (2, 5, 9)>
8. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5 <8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
