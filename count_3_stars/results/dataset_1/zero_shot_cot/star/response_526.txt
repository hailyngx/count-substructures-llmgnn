Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (6, 7, 1)>
2. Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 6)>
3. Node 2: <2, (4, 8, 9)>
4. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
5. Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 9)>
6. Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)>
7. Node 8: <8, (2, 3, 6)>
8. Node 9: <9, (4, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
