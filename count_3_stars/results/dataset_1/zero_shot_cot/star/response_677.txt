Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. Let's first identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8,)>
<2, (0, 3,)>
<3, (2, )>
<4, (1, 8,)>
<5, (8, 9,)>
<6, (0, 9,)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 6,)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars within the graph: 
[9]
