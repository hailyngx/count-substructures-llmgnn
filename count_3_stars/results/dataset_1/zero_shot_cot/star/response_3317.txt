Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 9)>
<6, (2, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars: [9]
