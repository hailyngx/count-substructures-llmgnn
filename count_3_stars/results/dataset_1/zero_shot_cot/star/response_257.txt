Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.
2. From the given list of edges, identify nodes with three incident edges:
   - Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7)
   - Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 8)
   - Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 9)
   - Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 9), (5, 9)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
