Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Starting with the given edges, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6 (forming a 3-star with center node 0 and leaves 4 and 6).
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9 (forming a 3-star with center node 1 and leaves 3, 5, and 9).
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9 (forming a 3-star with center node 4 and leaves 0, 6, and 9).
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5 (forming a 3-star with center node 6 and leaves 0, 4, and 5).
5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5 (forming a 3-star with center node 9 and leaves 1, 4, and 5).

Hence, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (4, 6)> 
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)> 
<6, (0, 4, 5)> 
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
