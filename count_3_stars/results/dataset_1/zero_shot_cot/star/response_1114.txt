Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    - Node 0 has neighbors 3, 6, 8
    - Node 1 has neighbors 5, 7
    - Node 5 has neighbors 1, 9
    - Node 6 has neighbors 0, 7, 9
    - Node 7 has neighbors 1, 6, 8, 9
    - Node 9 has neighbors 5, 6, 7

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
    - In this case, we can observe that 3-star patterns occur when a node is connected to three other nodes. 
    - Looking at the identified nodes, we see that nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9 can function as the center of a 3-star.
    
Step 3: Find the unique 3-stars.
    - Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
        - <0, (3, 6, 8)>
        - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
        - <5, (1, 9)>
        - <6, (0, 7, 9)>
        - <9, (5, 6, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
