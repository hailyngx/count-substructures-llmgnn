Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

By looking at the given edges, we can identify the nodes that have exactly three incident edges. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's list these nodes:

1. Node 0
2. Node 5
3. Node 7

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each of these central nodes to form the 3-stars:

For Node 0:
- Leaves: 4, 5, 9
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Leaves: 0, 3, 7
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>

For Node 7:
- Leaves: 1, 3, 9
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, and <7, (1, 3, 9)>.
