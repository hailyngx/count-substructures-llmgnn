Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we will count the instances of these 3-stars.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8)
   <0, (3, 4, 7)>
   <0, (3, 4, 8)>
   <0, (4, 7, 8)>

2. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6)
   <1, (5, 6, -)>

3. Node 2: (2, 7)
   <2, (7, -, -)>

4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 7)
   <3, (0, 7, -)>

5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)
   <4, (0, 6, 7)>
   <4, (0, 7, 8)>
   <4, (6, 7, 8)>

6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 6)
   <5, (1, 6, -)>

7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9)
   <6, (1, 5, -)>
   <6, (4, 5, 8)>
   <6, (5, 8, 9)>

8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8)
   <7, (0, 3, 4)>
   <7, (0, 4, 8)>
   <7, (3, 4, 8)>

9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   <8, (0, 6, 9)>
   <8, (4, 6, 7)>
   <8, (6, 7, 9)>

10. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8)
   <9, (6, 8, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of [10].
