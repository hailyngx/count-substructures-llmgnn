Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph: 

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 6: <2, (0, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, and 8: <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 9: <7, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
