Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [3].
