Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0: <0, (5, 7, 9)>
2. For node 1: <1, (2, 6, 8)>
3. For node 2: <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. For node 3: <3, (2, 5, 0)>
5. For node 4: <4, (6, 7, 0)>
6. For node 5: <5, (0, 3, 7)>
7. For node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)>
8. For node 7: <7, (0, 4, 5)>
9. For node 8: <8, (1, 9, 0)>
10. For node 9: <9, (0, 1, 8)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [10].
