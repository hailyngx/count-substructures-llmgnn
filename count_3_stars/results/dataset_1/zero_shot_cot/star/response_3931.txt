Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9:
   <0, (4, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6:
   <1, (2, 5, 6)>

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5:
   <6, (0, 1, 5)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.]
