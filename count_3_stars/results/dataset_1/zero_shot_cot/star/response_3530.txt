Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edge list, we notice that nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7 do not have any edges connecting to exactly three nodes, so they cannot be the center of a 3-star. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the remaining nodes:
- Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 5), (1, 2, 5, 6), (1, 5, 6, 8), (1, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 5, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 0, 1, 2), (5, 3, 6, 7), (5, 1, 2, 6), (5, 2, 6, 7)
- Node 8: (8, 1, 2, 3), (8, 1, 2, 9), (8, 1, 3, 9), (8, 2, 3, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 2, 3, 7), (9, 2, 3, 8), (9, 3, 7, 8), (9, 3, 8, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<3, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>,
<8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>,
<9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find that there are [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
