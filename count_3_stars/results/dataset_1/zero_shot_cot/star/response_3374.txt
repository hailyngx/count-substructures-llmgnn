Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 9, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
