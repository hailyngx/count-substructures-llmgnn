Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the correct degree. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaves, the nodes must satisfy the conditions:
- The total number of nodes must be one more than a multiple of 4.
- Each leaf node must be connected to exactly one central node and no other leaf nodes.

In this graph, nodes 0, 4, and 8 satisfy the conditions above and can be considered as potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 4)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>

Thus, we have found 4 unique 3-stars, and the output should be: [4].
