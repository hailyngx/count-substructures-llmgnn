Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (5, 7, -)>
3. <2, (6, 8, -)>
4. <3, (0, 8, -)>
5. <4, (6, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
7. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
8. <7, (1, 4, 5)>
9. <8, (2, 3, -)>
10. <9, (4, 5, -)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
