Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be considered as the centers of the 3-stars.

By examining the list of edges provided, we can identify the nodes with exactly three edges as follows:
- Node 5: (0, 5), (4, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (7, 4)

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, -)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
