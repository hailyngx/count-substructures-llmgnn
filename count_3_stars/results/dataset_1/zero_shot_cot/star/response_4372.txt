Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected in this manner. Let's denote the nodes as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3
- Node 7 is connected to node 4
- Node 8 is connected to node 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
[<0, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (6, 9, 0)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
