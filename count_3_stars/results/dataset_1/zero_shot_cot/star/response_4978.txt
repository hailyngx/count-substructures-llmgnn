Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, -)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, -, -)>
<5, (3, 4, -)>
<6, (0, 2, -)>
<7, (9, -, -)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
