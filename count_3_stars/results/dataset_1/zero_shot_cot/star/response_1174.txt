Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 5, 6)>
5. <4, (1, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
7. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
8. <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
