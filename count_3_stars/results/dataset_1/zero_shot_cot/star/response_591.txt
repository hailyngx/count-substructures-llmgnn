Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. 
The central nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9 since these nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Now, let's list down the 3-stars in the graph based on the central nodes:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 6 in total. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
