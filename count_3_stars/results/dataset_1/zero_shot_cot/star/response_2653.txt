Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Given the graph data, we can determine the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting them to the other nodes. Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
