Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <2, (1, 5, 7)>
4. <5, (1, 2, 8)>
5. <6, (0, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
