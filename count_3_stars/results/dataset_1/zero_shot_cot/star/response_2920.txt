Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. The central node (0) is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8. So, no 3-star.
2. The central node (1) is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. So, one 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 8)>.
3. The central node (2) is connected to nodes 6 and 9. So, no 3-star.
4. The central node (3) is connected to nodes 0 and 9. So, no 3-star.
5. The central node (4) is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8. So, one 3-star: <4, (0, 6, 8)>.
6. The central node (5) is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9. So, one 3-star: <5, (1, 8, 9)>.
7. The central node (6) is connected to nodes 2 and 4. So, no 3-star.
8. The central node (7) is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9. So, one 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 9)>.
9. The central node (8) is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5. So, no 3-star.
10. The central node (9) is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, no 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
