Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>  
2. <1, (4, 6, 7)>  
3. <2, (5, 7, -)>  
4. <3, (0, 4, 9)>  
5. <4, (1, 3, 5)>  
6. <5, (0, 2, 4)>  
7. <6, (0, 1, 4)>  
8. <7, (2, 4, 5)>  

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in the given graph.  
The final answer is [8].
