Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<1, (8, 9, x)>  (since x is not connected to any other node and cannot form a star)
<2, (0, 3, x)>  (since x is not connected to any other node and cannot form a star)
<3, (0, 4, x)>  (since x is not connected to any other node and cannot form a star>
<5, (6, 7, x)>  (since x is not connected to any other node and cannot form a star)
<8, (1, 9, x)>  (since x is not connected to any other node and cannot form a star)

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
The final answer is [4].
