Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a star.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. From node 0: (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
2. From node 3: (3, 4)
3. From node 4: (4, 0, 3, 8)
4. From node 5: (5, 6, 7)
5. From node 6: (6, 0, 5)
6. From node 7: (7, 5, 8)
7. From node 8: (8, 0, 4, 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:

<0, (2, 4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4)>
<5, (6, 7)>
<7, (5, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
