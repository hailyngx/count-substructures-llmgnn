Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
Node 0 is connected to node 5.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to node 1.
Node 7 is connected to node 9.
Node 8 is connected to node 2.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 7.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is 4. 

So, the final answer is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>.
