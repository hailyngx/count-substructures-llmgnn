Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
1. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 9)>
