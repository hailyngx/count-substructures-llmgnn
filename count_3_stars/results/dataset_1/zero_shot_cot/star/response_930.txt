Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. Hence, the 3-star <0, (1, 5, 6)> is found.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4. Hence, the 3-star <1, (0, 2, 4)> is found.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6. Hence, the 3-star <2, (1, 3, 6)> is found.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5. Hence, the 3-star <3, (2, 4, 5)> is found.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5. Hence, the 3-star <4, (1, 3, 5)> is found.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4. Hence, the 3-star <5, (0, 3, 4)> is found.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5. Hence, the 3-star <6, (0, 2, 5)> is found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
