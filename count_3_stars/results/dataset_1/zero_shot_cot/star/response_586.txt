Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (1, 5, 8)
2. Node 1: (0, 5, 2)
3. Node 2: (5, 7, 8)
4. Node 3: (0, 8, 5)
5. Node 5: (1, 2, 8)
6. Node 7: (2, 8, 5)
7. Node 8: (3, 5, 7)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 5)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>
