Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
