Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node's neighbors and see if there is a 3-star centered at that node. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6
  - 3-star at node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7
  - 3-star at node 1: <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 2 has neighbors: 6, 9
  - No 3-star can be formed at node 2.
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 6
  - 3-star at node 3: <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 7
  - 3-star at node 4: <4, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0
  - No 3-star can be formed at node 5.
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 3
  - 3-star at node 6: <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 4
  - No 3-star can be formed at node 7.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2
  - No 3-star can be formed at node 9.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>.
