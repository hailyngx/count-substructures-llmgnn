Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 8
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
   - Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5
   - Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
   - Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 7
   - Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 9
   - Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 0
   - Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 4, 7

2. From the above analysis, we can identify the following 3-stars:
   - <0, (2, 4, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 6)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 4, 7)>
   - <7, (0, 5, 9)>
   - <9, (4, 7, 0)>

3. Counting the total number of 3-stars: 8

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
