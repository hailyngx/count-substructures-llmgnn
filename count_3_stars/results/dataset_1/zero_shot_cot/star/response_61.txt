Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes of the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From node 0: (0, 2, 7), (0, 4, 9) [2 unique 3-stars]
- From node 1: (1, 2, 7), (1, 6, 9) [2 unique 3-stars]
- From node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 7, 8) [2 unique 3-stars]
- From node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 4, 9) [2 unique 3-stars]
- From node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 2, 9) [2 unique 3-stars]
- From node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 6, 7) [2 unique 3-stars]

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Let's represent these as follows:
<0, (2, 7, 4)>, <0, (4, 9, 0)>, <1, (2, 7, 1)>, <1, (6, 9, 1)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (4, 9, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (2, 9, 7)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
