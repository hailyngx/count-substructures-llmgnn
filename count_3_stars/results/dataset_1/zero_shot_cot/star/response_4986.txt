Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, as these would be potential central nodes for 3-stars. The nodes connected to node 0 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed central nodes of 3-stars by verifying that they each have exactly three edges. 
- Node 1 has 2 edges connected to it. It cannot be a central node.
- Node 3 has 2 edges connected to it. It cannot be a central node.
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected to it. It cannot be a central node.
- Node 7 has 2 edges connected to it. It cannot be a central node.
- Node 8 has 2 edges connected to it. It cannot be a central node.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. 

The final answer is: [0]
