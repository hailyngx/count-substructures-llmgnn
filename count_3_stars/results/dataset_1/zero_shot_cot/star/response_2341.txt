Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 

Let's look at each node and its adjacent nodes to find all possible 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8) -> <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9) -> <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 8) -> No 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7) -> No 3-star
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 9) -> <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 8) -> No 3-star
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 9) -> No 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 8) -> <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 7) -> <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 6) -> <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
