Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Starting with node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - <0, (1, 7)>

2. Moving on to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
   - <1, (0, 7, 2)>
   - <1, (0, 7, 3)>
   - <1, (0, 7, 5)>
   - <1, (0, 7, 6)>
   - <1, (0, 7, 8)>

3. Moving on to node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
   - <2, (1, 7)>

4. Moving on to node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
   - <3, (1, 6, 7)>

5. Moving on to node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to node 5.
   - <4, (5)>

6. Moving on to node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, and 7.
   - <5, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (1, 6, 7)>

7. Moving on to node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8.
   - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 7, 8)>

8. Moving on to node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
   - <7, (0, 2, 3)>
   - <7, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (0, 6, 9)>

9. Moving on to node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
   - <8, (1, 6)>

10. Moving on to node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to node 7.
   - <9, (7)>

So, there are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
