Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
   
Nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Step 2: For each node identified in Step 1, check if it forms a 3-star.

- For Node 0:
    - <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- For Node 3:
    - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
- For Node 7:
    - <7, (0, 3, 6)>
    - <7, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- For Node 8:
    - <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified in Step 2.

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
