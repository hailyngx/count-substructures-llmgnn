Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the central nodes in the graph. These are the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the central nodes:

Central Nodes: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
