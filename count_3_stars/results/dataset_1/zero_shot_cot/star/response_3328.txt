Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node of each 3-star configuration. We will then check if they have exactly three leaves connected to the central node. 

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
