Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 9)
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8)
(2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7)
(3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7)
(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5)
(5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)
(6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 8)
(7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3)
(8, 1), (8, 6)
(9, 0)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 6)>
