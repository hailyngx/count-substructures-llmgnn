Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the possible 3-stars. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 9), (2, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>

There are [5] unique 3-stars in the graph.
