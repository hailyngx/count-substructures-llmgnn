Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each unique combination where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, -)>

The last 3-star <9, (0, 1, -)> is missing one connected node because there are no available edges connecting node 9 to another node. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
