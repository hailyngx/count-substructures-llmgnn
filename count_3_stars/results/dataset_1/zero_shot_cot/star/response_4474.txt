Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors.
    - Node 0, 4, 8, and 9 have exactly three neighbors.

Step 2: Look for 3-stars centered at the nodes identified in Step 1.
    - For node 0:
        - <0, (1, 4, 8)>
        - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
        - <0, (4, 8, 9)>
    - For node 4:
        - <4, (0, 1, 9)>
    - For node 8:
        - <8, (0, 3, 5)>
    - For node 9:
        - <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
    - Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
