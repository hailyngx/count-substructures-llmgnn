Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it for each 3-star. 

Given the edges provided, we can find the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (6, 9, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we can determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
