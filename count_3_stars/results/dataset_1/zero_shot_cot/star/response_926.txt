Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
