Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8. It forms a 3-star. 
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8. It forms a 3-star.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8. It forms a 3-star.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7. It forms a 3-star.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. It forms a 3-star.
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9. It forms a 3-star.
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 4. It forms a 3-star.

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
