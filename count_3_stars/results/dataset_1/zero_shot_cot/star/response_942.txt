Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Looking at the edge list, we see that nodes 3, 4, and 7 form a 3-star with center node 4: <4, (3, 7)>. 
Similarly, nodes 6, 7, and 8 form a 3-star with center node 7: <7, (6, 8)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <4, (3, 7)> and <7, (6, 8)>.
