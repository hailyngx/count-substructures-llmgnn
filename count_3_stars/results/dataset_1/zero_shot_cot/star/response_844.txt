Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (1)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

There are a total of [10] 3-star configurations in the graph.
