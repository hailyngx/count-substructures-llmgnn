Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node (degree = 3) in order to find the 3-stars. 

Nodes connected to node 0: 2
Nodes connected to node 1: 8
Nodes connected to node 2: 0, 7
Nodes connected to node 3: 8
Nodes connected to node 4: 8, 9
Nodes connected to node 5: 6, 8, 9
Nodes connected to node 6: 5, 7
Nodes connected to node 7: 2, 6
Nodes connected to node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
Nodes connected to node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.]
<2, (0, 7, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
