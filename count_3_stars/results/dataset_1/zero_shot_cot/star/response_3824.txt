Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<2, (3, 8, 3)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 0, 0)>
<5, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
