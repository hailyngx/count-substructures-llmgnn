Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
2. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
3. <6, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [3].
