Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8. So, a 3-star is formed at node 0: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8. So, a 3-star is formed at node 1: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9. So, a 3-star is formed at node 3: <3, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
