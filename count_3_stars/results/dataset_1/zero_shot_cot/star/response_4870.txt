Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Starting by listing all 3-star patterns:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [11]
