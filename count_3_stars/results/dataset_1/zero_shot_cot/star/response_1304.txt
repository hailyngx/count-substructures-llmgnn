Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 1.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 1)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 0)>
<9, (1, 4, 1)>

Since all the identified 3-stars are unique, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
