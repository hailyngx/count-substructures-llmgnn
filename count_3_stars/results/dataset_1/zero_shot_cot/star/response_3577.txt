Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the provided information, we can see that node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (2, 3, 4, 5), node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 6, 8), and node 8 is connected to 4 other nodes (3, 4, 6, 7, 9). 

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
