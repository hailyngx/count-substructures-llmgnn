Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the edges and identify the 3-stars. 

1. Node 0:
   - 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>

2. Node 1:
   - 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 6)>

3. Node 2:
   - No 3-stars (Does not have enough connections)

4. Node 3:
   - 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>

5. Node 4:
   - 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>

6. Node 5:
   - No 3-stars (Does not have enough connections)

7. Node 6:
   - 3-star: <6, (1, 4, 7)>

8. Node 7:
   - 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-stars (Does not have enough connections)

10. Node 9:
   - No 3-stars (Does not have enough connections)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore [9].
