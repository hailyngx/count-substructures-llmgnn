Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 3, 7)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
4. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
5. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
6. <7, (0, 1, 8)>
7. <8, (2, 5, 7)>
8. <9, (3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
