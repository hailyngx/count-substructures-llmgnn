Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 
The central nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
Based on the given edges, we can identify the leaves for each central node: 
- Central node 0 has leaves 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Central node 1 has leaves 3, 6, 9
- Central node 2 has leaves 0, 3, 5, 7
- Central node 3 has leaves 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Central node 4 has leaves 0, 3, 5, 7
- Central node 5 has leaves 0, 2, 4
- Central node 6 has leaves 0, 1, 3, 8
- Central node 7 has leaves 0, 2, 4
- Central node 8 has leaves 0, 6, 9
- Central node 9 has leaves 1, 3, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[There are a total of 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
