Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 1: (1, 2, 9), (1, 6, 7)
- For node 2: (2, 1, 9)
- For node 3: (3, 4, 6), (3, 6, 9), (3, 9, 4)
- For node 4: (4, 3, 6)
- For node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 3, 4), (6, 4, 3)
- For node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 1, 2), (9, 2, 1), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 3)

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [14]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 9, 0)>, <1, (6, 7, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>, <3, (9, 4, 6)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 2, 1)>, <9, (3, 6, 9)>
