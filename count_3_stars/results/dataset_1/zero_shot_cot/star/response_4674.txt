Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 6)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
4. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
5. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <7, (1, 2, 9)>
7. <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
