Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 9, 1)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9].
