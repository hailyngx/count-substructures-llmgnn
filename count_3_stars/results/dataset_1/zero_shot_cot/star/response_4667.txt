Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first list out all possible 3-stars with the corresponding central node and leaf nodes.

Based on the given edges, the possible 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (6)>
<4, (8, 9)>
<5, (6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1)>
<8, (1, 4)>
<9, (4, 5)>

Now, we count the unique 3-stars: [12].
