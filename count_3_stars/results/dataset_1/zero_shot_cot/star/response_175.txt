Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. 
To be part of a 3-star, a node must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. 
Let's list the nodes that meet this criterion: 

- Node 0: 2 edges
- Node 1: 1 edge
- Node 2: 3 edges
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 4: 3 edges <3, 4, 7>
- Node 5: 4 edges <2,4,9>
- Node 7: 1 edge
- Node 8: 2 edges
- Node 9: 4 edges <0,5,8>

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node with exactly 3 edges, since they can be centers of 3-stars. 

The number of 3-stars in this graph: []
<3, 4, 7>
<5, 2, 9>
<9, 0, 8>
