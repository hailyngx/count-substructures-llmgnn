Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of a 3-star in the graph. 

Let's first list the 3-stars we find in the graph:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars in the graph, we find a total of [3].
