Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 5.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 8.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 3, 7, 9.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 3, 5, 8.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
