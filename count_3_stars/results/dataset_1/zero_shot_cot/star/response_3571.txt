Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars. 

Let's start by examining each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Node 0:
- (0, 2, 8)
- (0, 2, 9)
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
Total: 2

Node 2:
- (2, 0, 8)
- (2, 0, 9)
- (2, 4, 6)
- (2, 4, 7)
- (2, 4, 9)
- (2, 6, 4)
- (2, 6, 7)
- (2, 7, 4)
- (2, 7, 9)
- (2, 8, 0)
- (2, 8, 9)
- (2, 9, 0)
- (2, 9, 4)
- (2, 9, 7)
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (8, 0, 9)>
- <2, (9, 4, 7)>
Total: 6

Node 4:
- (4, 2, 6)
- (4, 2, 9)
- (4, 6, 2)
- (4, 6, 9)
- (4, 9, 2)
- (4, 9, 7)
- <4, (2, 6, 9)>
Total: 1

Node 6:
- (6, 2, 4)
- (6, 4, 2)
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
Total: 1

Node 7:
- (7, 2, 9)
- (7, 9, 2)
- <7, (2, 9, 4)>
Total: 1

Node 8:
- (8, 0, 2)
- (8, 2, 0)
- (8, 2, 9)
- <8, (0, 2, 9)>
Total: 2

Node 9:
- (9, 0, 2)
- (9, 2, 0)
- (9, 2, 4)
- (9, 2, 7)
- (9, 4, 2)
- (9, 4, 7)
- (9, 7, 2)
- <9, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
Total: 2

Total number of 3-stars: 2 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 15

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (8, 0, 9)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 9, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>
