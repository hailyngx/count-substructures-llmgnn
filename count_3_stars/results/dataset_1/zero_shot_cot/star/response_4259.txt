Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. We need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6

Next, let's list out all the 3-stars in the graph with their corresponding nodes:

<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
