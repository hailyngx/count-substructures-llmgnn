Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 2, -)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 2, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
6. <6, (2, 4, -)>
7. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
8. <8, (2, 5, 9)>
9. <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
