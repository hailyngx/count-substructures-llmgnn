Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Given the edge list provided, we can start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star configuration. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 6, 0)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
