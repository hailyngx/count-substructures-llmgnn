Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars with the center node. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 6, 0)>
- <1, (0, 6, 2)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (6, 7, 8)>
- <9, (3, 4, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
