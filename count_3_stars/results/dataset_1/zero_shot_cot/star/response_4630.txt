Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We know that a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like structure.

Given the edges in the graph, we can determine the 3-stars by identifying the central node and its three connected nodes.

Looking at the graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 8)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <3, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <6, (0, 2, 3)>
6. <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
