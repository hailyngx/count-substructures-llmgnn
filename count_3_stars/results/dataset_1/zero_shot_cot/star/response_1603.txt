Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, -)>
<2, (6, -, -)>
<3, (5, -, -)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, -)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, -)>
<9, (1, 7, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
