Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the center nodes:
   - Nodes 0, 2, and 3 have 3 edges each.
   - Nodes 1, 6, and 9 have 1 edge each.
   - Nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8 have 4 edges each.

2. Count the 3-stars in the graph:
   - For a 3-star to exist, the center node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
   
3. Count the 3-stars based on the center nodes:
   <0, (3, 4, 9)>
   <2, (5, 7, 8)>
   <3, (0, 6, 7)>

4. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [3] 

Therefore, the final answer is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, and <3, (0, 6, 7)>.
