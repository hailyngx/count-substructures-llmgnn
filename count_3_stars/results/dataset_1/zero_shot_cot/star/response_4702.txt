Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 3, 7
Node 1: 6
Node 2: 6
Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 3, 4, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 9
Node 7: 0, 3
Node 8: 3, 5, 9
Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

We observe the following 3-stars:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, and <6, (1, 2, 9)>.
