Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes
- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes
- Node 1 is connected to 1 node
- Node 2 is connected to 2 nodes
- Node 3 is connected to 2 nodes
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes
- Node 5 is connected to 2 nodes
- Node 6 is connected to 1 node
- Node 7 is connected to 1 node
- Node 8 is connected to 1 node

Step 2: Identify all possible 3-star configurations
- Since only node 4 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (0, 3, 6, and 8), we will have 3-stars centered at node 4.
- The 3-stars can be formed by choosing 2 nodes out of the 3 connected nodes.
- The unique 3-star combinations are: 
  <4, (0, 3, 6)>
  <4, (0, 3, 8)>
  <4, (0, 6, 8)>
  <4, (3, 6, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found
- There are 4 unique 3-star configurations.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
