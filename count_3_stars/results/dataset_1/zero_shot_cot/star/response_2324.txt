Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step.

Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 9, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So the final answer is [10].
