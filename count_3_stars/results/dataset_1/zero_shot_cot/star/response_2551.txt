Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Given that a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of 18 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
