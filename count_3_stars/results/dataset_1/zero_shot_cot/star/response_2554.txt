Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. First, let's list out all nodes along with their adjacent nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

2. Now, we have identified the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. Let's list them inside <>:
<0, (4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3), (5, 8)>
<5, (4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 3), (8)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>

3. Finally, let's count the unique 3-stars listed inside the <>:
