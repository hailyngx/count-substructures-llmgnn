Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges.

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
