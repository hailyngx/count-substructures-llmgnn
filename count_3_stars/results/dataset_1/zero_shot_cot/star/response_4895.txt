Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form a 3-star.

1. Node 1 has edges with nodes 2 and 4. So, node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 2 and 4.
2. Node 3 has edges with nodes 7 and 9. So, node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 7 and 9.
3. Node 6 has edges with nodes 7 and 8. So, node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 7 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 4)>
<3, (7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
