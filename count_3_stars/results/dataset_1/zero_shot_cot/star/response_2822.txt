Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

The central node can be any node from 0 to 9.
For each central node, we need to find 3 leaves (connected directly to the central node) such that the leaves are not directly connected to each other.

By going through the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (7, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 8, 9)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 8)>
6. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
7. <6, (1, 5, 8)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 5)>
9. <8, (3, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Thus, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
