Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
- The central node is node 0: (0, 1, 4, 5)
- The central node is node 1: (1, 0, 2, 4), (1, 0, 4, 5)
- The central node is node 2: (2, 1, 3, 6)
- The central node is node 3: (3, 2, 4, 9)
- The central node is node 4: (4, 0, 1, 3), (4, 0, 7, 8), (4, 0, 7, 9), (4, 1, 3, 7), (4, 1, 5, 7), (4, 1, 7, 8), (4, 1, 7, 9), (4, 3, 7, 9)
- The central node is node 5: (5, 0, 1, 7)
- The central node is node 6: (6, 2)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
    
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2)>
