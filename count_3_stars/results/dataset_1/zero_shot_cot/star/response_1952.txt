Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph: 

<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
