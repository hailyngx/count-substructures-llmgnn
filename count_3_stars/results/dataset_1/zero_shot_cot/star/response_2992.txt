Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 3, 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 8

Next, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph. We notice that there are only two 3-star structures in this graph: one centered around node 0 and one centered around node 8. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
