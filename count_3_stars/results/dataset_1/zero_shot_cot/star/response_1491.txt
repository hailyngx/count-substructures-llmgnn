Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 2: (2, 6, 9)
2. Central node 3: (3, 0, 6)
3. Central node 6: (6, 2, 8)
4. Central node 7: (7, 1, 8)
5. Central node 8: (8, 1, 5)
6. Central node 9: (9, 2, 3)

Count of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars: <2, (6, 9, 2)>, <3, (0, 6, 3)>, <6, (2, 8, 6)>, <7, (1, 8, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>.
