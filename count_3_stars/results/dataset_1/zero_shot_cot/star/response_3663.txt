Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to 2 nodes: 3, 7
- Node 2 is connected to 5 nodes: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 3, 6
- Node 6 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 4, 9
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes: 0, 9

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 2 forms three 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
