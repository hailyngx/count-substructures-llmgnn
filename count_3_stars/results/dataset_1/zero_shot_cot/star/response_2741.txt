Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first determine the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: neighbors {0, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 4, 5}

From the above list, we can see that the nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 9 have exactly three neighbors. Let's enumerate the 3-stars:

- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
