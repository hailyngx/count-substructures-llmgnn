Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Given the list of edges:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 2, 3
- Node 2 is connected to 1 node: 1
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 6, 9
- Node 5 is connected to 1 node: 7
- Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes: 3, 9
- Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8 is connected to 1 node: 7
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 3, 6, 7

By examining the connections, we can identify the 3-star patterns:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
<0, (1, 7, 9)> <1, (0, 2, 3)> <3, (1, 6, 9)> <7, (0, 5, 8)> <9, (0, 3, 6)>
