Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- The central node 0 has leaves 1, 6, but there is no third leaf connected to it.
- The central node 1 has leaves 0, 4, 9. So, <1, (0, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.
- The central node 2 has leaves 3, but there is no third leaf connected to it.
- The central node 3 has leaves 2, 6, 9. So, <3, (2, 6, 9)> is a 3-star.
- The central node 4 has leaves 1, 5, 6. So, <4, (1, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
- The central node 5 has leaves 4, 7, 8. So, <5, (4, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.
- The central node 6 has leaves 0, 3, 4. So, <6, (0, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.
- The central node 7 has leaves 5, 9, but there is no third leaf connected to it.
- The central node 8 has leaves 4, 5, 6. So, <8, (4, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.
- The central node 9 has leaves 1, 3, 7. So, <9, (1, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
