Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 9, 1)>
2. <1, (3, 0, 9)>
3. <2, (3, 8, 6)>
4. <4, (3, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (4, 3, 6)>
6. <8, (3, 2, 6)>
7. <9, (0, 1, 6)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [7].
