Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

It appears that the central node must be node 1 since it is connected to the most nodes. The nodes connected to node 1 are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 9)>
3. <1, (6, 0, 4)>
4. <1, (6, 0, 5)>
5. <1, (6, 4, 7)>
6. <1, (6, 4, 7)>
7. <1, (6, 5, 7)>
8. <1, (6, 5, 7)>
9. <1, (9, 0, 3)>
10. <1, (9, 3, 7)>
11. <1, (9, 7, 0)>
12. <1, (9, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
