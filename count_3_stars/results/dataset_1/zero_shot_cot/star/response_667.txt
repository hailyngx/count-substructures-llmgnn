Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center of each 3-star
- Only consider nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.
- Possible centers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8

Step 2: Identify the neighbors of each center node
- For each center node, identify which three nodes are connected to it.

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars
- Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph based on the identified center nodes and their connected nodes.

Final Answer: [3]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 9, 4)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
