Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, -)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 2, -)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 9, -)>
- Node 9: <9, (4, 2, 7)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph.
