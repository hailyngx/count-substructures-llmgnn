Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes are connected to each node to determine the 3-star configurations.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are <0, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 9, 5)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, and <6, (2, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
