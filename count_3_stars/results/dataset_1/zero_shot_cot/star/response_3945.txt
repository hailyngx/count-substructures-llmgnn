Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique occurrence of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Central node 1 with leaves 0, 2, 3: <1, (0, 2, 3)>
2. Central node 1 with leaves 4, 6, empty: <1, (4, 6)>
3. Central node 2 with leaves 4, 7, empty: <2, (4, 7)>
4. Central node 3 with leaves 5, 8, empty: <3, (5, 8)>
5. Central node 5 with leaves 4, 7, 9: <5, (4, 7, 9)>
6. Central node 7 with leaves 5, 6, empty: <7, (5, 6)>
7. Central node 8 with leaves 3, 9, empty: <8, (3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
