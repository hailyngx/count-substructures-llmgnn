Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 3, 6, 8)
   - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
   - <0, (2, 3, 8)>

2. Node 1: (1, 3, 5)
   - <1, (3, 5)>

3. Node 2: (2, 0, 3, 4, 5, 8)
   - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
   - <2, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <2, (0, 3, 8)>

4. Node 3: (3, 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9)
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 8)>

5. Node 4: (4, 2, 9)
   - <4, (2, 9)>

6. Node 5: (5, 1, 2, 3, 7)
   - <5, (1, 2, 3)>

7. Node 6: (6, 0)
   - No 3-star centered at node 6.

8. Node 7: (7, 5, 9)
   - <7, (5, 9)>

9. Node 8: (8, 0, 2, 3)
   - <8, (0, 2, 3)>

10. Node 9: (9, 3, 4, 7)
   - <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <1, (3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>
