Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's visualize the graph with the given edges:

(0)---(4)
 |     |
(2)---(5)---(1)
 |     |     |
(9)---(8)---(7)
       |
      (3)

We need to count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
