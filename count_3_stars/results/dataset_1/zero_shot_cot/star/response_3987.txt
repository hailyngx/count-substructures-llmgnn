Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list all nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6.

Now, let's list the 3-star configurations:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
