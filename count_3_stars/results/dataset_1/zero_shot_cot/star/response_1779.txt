Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (3, 5, x)> (Note: x is unknown)
- <1, (5, 7, x)> (Note: x is unknown)
- <3, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

[5]
