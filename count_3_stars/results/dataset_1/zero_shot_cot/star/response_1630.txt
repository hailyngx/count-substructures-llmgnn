Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 4, 6) - <0, (4, 6)>
- Node 1: (1, 4, 5) - <1, (4, 5)>
- Node 2: Not a part of any 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 1, 4) - <3, (1, 4)>
- Node 4: Not a part of any 3-star (already counted in other 3-stars)
- Node 5: Not a part of any 3-star (already counted in other 3-stars)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 5) - <6, (0, 5)>
- Node 7: (7, 1, 6) - <7, (1, 6)>
- Node 8: Not a part of any 3-star
- Node 9: (9, 2, 8) - <9, (2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 6)>, <1, (4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4)>, <6, (0, 5)>, <7, (1, 6)>
