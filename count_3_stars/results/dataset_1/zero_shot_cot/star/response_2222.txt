Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are part of a 3-star structure.
    - Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Step 2: For each node, determine the number of edges connected to it. This will help identify potential central nodes for 3-stars.
    - Node 0: 1 edge
    - Node 1: 2 edges
    - Node 2: 3 edges
    - Node 3: 3 edges
    - Node 4: 2 edges
    - Node 5: 2 edges
    - Node 6: 1 edge
    - Node 7: 4 edges
    - Node 8: 6 edges
    - Node 9: 3 edges

Step 3: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
    - From the above analysis, nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9 are potential central nodes for 3-stars.
    
    <2, (3, 5, 8)>
    <3, (2, 8, 9)>
    <8, (2, 3, 4)>
    <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
