Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify the central nodes (nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes).
2. For each central node, find the nodes connected to it and form 3-stars.

Central nodes: 0, 3, 8, 9

3-stars:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Count = 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
