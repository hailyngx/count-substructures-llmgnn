Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges:

1. For node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)
   <0, (2, 3, 4)>

2. For node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8)
   <1, (2, 3, 8)>

3. For node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3)
   <2, (0, 1, 3)>

4. For node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)
   <3, (0, 1, 2)>

5. For node 4: (4, 0), (4, 7)
   No 3-star centered at node 4.

6. For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 9)
   No 3-star centered at node 5.

7. For node 6: (6, 7), (6, 9)
   No 3-star centered at node 6.

8. For node 7: (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8)
   <7, (3, 4, 8)>

9. For node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 9)
   <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (7, 3, 9)>

10. For node 9: (9, 2), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)
   <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (8, 6, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (7, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>
