Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given edges, we can see that the center nodes and their leaves are as follows:
- Center 0: Leaves 2, 8
- Center 1: Leaves 6, 7
- Center 2: Leaves 0, 8
- Center 3: Leaves 4, 9
- Center 4: Leaves 3, 5
- Center 6: Leaves 1, 9
- Center 7: Leaves 1, 9
- Center 8: Leaves 0, 2, 9
- Center 9: Leaves 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 8)>
<1, (6, 7)>
<2, (0, 8)>
<3, (4, 9)>
<4, (3, 5)>
<6, (1, 9)>
<7, (1, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 7, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have 9 in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
