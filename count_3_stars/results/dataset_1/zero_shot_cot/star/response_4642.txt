Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars by finding the unique combinations of nodes where one node is the center and the other three are connected to it.

Let's list out the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (8, 2, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
