Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to find the 3-stars.

First, let's list the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: (0, 2, 7, 8), (0, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 6, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 2, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 1, 4), (7, 2, 4, 6)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>.
