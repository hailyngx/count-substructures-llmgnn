Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, -)>
<3, (2, 4, -)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, -)>
<7, (4, -, -)>
<8, (1, -, -)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. We found 10 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is: 

[10]
