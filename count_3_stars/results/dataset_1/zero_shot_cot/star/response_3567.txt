Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 2, 3, 5
   <0, (2, 3, 5)>

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 5, 9
   <1, (5, 9)>

3. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 4, 6, 8
   <2, (4, 6, 8)>

4. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 4, 8
   <3, (4, 8)>

5. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
   <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>

6. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 0, 1
   <5, (0, 1)>

7. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 2, 4, 7, 8
   <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>

8. Central node: 8
   Leaves: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
   <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>

9. Central node: 9
   Leaves: 1, 4, 8
   <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
