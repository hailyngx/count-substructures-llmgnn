Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <1, (4, 5, 6)>
4. <2, (0, 8, 9)>
5. <3, (1, 9, 4)>
6. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
7. <4, (6, 7, 9)>
8. <5, (1, 6, 8)>
9. <6, (0, 4, 5)>
10. <6, (4, 5, 7)>
11. <9, (0, 2, 3)>
12. <9, (4, 3, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
