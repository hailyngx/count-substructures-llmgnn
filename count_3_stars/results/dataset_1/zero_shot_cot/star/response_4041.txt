Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 1)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 1)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, -)> (Only two leaves connected to node 7)
<8, (6, -, -)> (Only one leaf connected to node 8)
<9, (6, -, -)> (Only one leaf connected to node 9)
