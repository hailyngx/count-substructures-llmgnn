Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
