Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors and construct all possible 3-star configurations around those nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's construct the 3-stars:

<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
