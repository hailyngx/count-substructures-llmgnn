Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0:
    - <0, (2, 5, 8)>
    
2. Node 1:
    - <1, (6, 7, 9)>
    
3. Node 2:
    - <2, (0, 7, 8)>
    
4. Node 3:
    - No 3-star
    
5. Node 5:
    - <5, (0, 9, 6)>
    
6. Node 6:
    - <6, (1, 9, 5)>
    
7. Node 7:
    - <7, (1, 2, 8)>
    
8. Node 8:
    - <8, (0, 2, 7)>
    
9. Node 9:
    - No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
