Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by locating the central node and its three connected nodes. 

From the given edges, the possible 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (2, 6, X)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, X)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, X)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, X, X)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
