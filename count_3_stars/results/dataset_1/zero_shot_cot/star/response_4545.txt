Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can find all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

In this graph, the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 0, 1, 6, and 7.

Now, let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
