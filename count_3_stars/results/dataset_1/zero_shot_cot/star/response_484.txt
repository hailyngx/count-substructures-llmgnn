Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star. 

First, let's find the central nodes and their corresponding leaves based on the edges provided:
- Central nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Leaves connected to each central node:
    - Central node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
    - Central node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
    - Central node 3: 1, 4, 8
    - Central node 4: 1, 3
    - Central node 5: 2, 7, 8, 9
    - Central node 6: 0, 1, 2
    - Central node 7: 1, 2, 5
    - Central node 8: 3, 5
    - Central node 9: 1, 2, 5

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
