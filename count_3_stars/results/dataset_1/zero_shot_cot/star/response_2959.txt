Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (5, 8, 9)>
2. <1, (6, 7, -)>
3. <2, (3, 6, -)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (5, 7, 8)>
6. <5, (0, 3, 4)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 8)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (0, 4, 6)>
10. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
