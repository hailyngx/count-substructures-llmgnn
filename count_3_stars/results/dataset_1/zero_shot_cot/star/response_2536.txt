Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

First, let's list down the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- From node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (0, 5, 9)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- From node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- From node 5: <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.
