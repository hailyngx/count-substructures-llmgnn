Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-star graphs.

Based on the given edges, the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5 and 9.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (6, 9)>
<7, (5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
