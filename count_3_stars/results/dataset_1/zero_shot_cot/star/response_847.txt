Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 8. Possible 3-stars involving node 0 are:
   <0, (6, 7, 8)>

2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8. Possible 3-stars involving node 1 are:
   <1, (3, 6, 7)>
   <1, (3, 6, 8)>
   <1, (3, 7, 8)>
   <1, (6, 7, 8)>

3. Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 3. Since it doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star, we skip it.

4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 0. Possible 3-stars involving node 3 are:
   <3, (1, 2, 6)>
   <3, (1, 6, 0)>
   
5. Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 7. Since it doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star, we skip it.

6. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 7. Possible 3-stars involving node 6 are:
   <6, (0, 1, 3)>
   <6, (0, 7, 1)>
   <6, (0, 7, 3)>

7. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6. Possible 3-stars involving node 7 are:
   <7, (0, 1, 4)>
   <7, (0, 6, 1)>
   <7, (0, 6, 4)>

8. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2. Possible 3-stars involving node 8 are:
   <8, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (6, 7, 8)> 
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 7, 1)>
<6, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<7, (0, 6, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars we found: [14]
