Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0:
   None

2. Node 1:
   <1, (7, 9, 0)>

3. Node 2:
   <2, (3, 6, 7)>

4. Node 3:
   <3, (2, 5, 9)>

5. Node 4:
   None

6. Node 5:
   <5, (0, 3, 7)>
   <5, (7, 9, 6)>

7. Node 6:
   <6, (2, 4, 9)>
   <6, (4, 9, 5)>

8. Node 7:
   <7, (1, 5, 2)>
   <7, (2, 5, 9)>
   <7, (1, 9, 0)>

9. Node 9:
   <9, (1, 3, 5)>
   <9, (1, 6, 7)>
   <9, (5, 6, 2)>
   <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [14].
