Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

Possible 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 9, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
