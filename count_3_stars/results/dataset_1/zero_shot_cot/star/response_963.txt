Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 9:
   - <0, (3, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8:
   - <1, (2, 7, 8)>

3. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8:
   - <2, (1, 4, 8)>

4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 8:
   - <3, (0, 7, 8)>

5. Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges connected to it.

6. Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it has 3 edges connected to it but not in the correct pattern.

7. Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it has 2 edges connected to it.

8. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5:
   - <7, (1, 3, 5)>

9. Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it has 5 edges connected to it.

10. Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it has 4 edges connected to it.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
