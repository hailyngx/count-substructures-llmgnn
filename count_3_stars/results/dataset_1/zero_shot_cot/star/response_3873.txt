Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which are potential centers of 3-stars:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 7
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 3
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 5
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 2, 5

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars by checking the configurations of 3-stars.

Considering each potential center node:
1. Node 1:
   - <1, (2, 4, 6)>
   - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 9)>
   [4 unique 3-stars]

2. Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 5, 9)>
   [1 unique 3-star]

3. Node 3: (No 3-star configurations)

4. Node 4: (No 3-star configurations)

5. Node 5:
   - <5, (2, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (2, 7, 9)>
   - <5, (6, 7, 9)>
   [3 unique 3-stars]

6. Node 6: (No 3-star configurations)

7. Node 7: (No 3-star configurations)

8. Node 9: (No 3-star configurations)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 1 + 3 = 8].
