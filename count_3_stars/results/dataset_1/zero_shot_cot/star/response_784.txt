Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that create 3-stars around them. We look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (8, 4, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (2, 7, -)>
5. <4, (8, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 6, -)>
7. <6, (2, 5, -)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 9)>
9. <8, (1, 2, 4)>
10. <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Thus, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
