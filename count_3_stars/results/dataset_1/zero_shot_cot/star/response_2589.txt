Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. **Node 1**: (1, 4), (1, 8) --- Node 1 forms a 3-star <1, (4, 8)>

2. **Node 2**: (2, 6) --- Node 2 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to two other nodes.

3. **Node 4**: (4, 1), (4, 5) --- Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (1, 5)>

4. **Node 5**: (5, 4), (5, 8) --- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (4, 8)>

5. **Node 6**: (6, 2), (6, 7) --- Node 6 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to two other nodes.

6. **Node 7**: (7, 6) --- Node 7 does not form a 3-star since it is only connected to one other node.

7. **Node 8**: (8, 1), (8, 5) --- Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (1, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 8)>, <4, (1, 5)>, and <5, (4, 8)>.
