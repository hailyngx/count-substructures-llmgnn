Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Starting with node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4)
  - <0, (1, 3, 4)>

- Moving to node 1: (1, 0)
  - No 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

- Moving to node 2: (2, 9)
  - No 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

- Moving to node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5)
  - <3, (0, 4, 5)>

- Moving to node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 9)
  - <4, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 3, 9)>

- Moving to node 5: (5, 3)
  - No 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

- Moving to node 6: (6, 9)
  - No 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

- Moving to node 8: (8, 4), (8, 9)
  - No 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

- Moving to node 9: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 8)
  - <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
