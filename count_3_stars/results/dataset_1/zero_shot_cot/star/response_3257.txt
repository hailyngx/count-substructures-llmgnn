Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes which are connected to node 8, as node 8 will be the central node in each 3-star.

The nodes connected to node 8 are: 0, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, we can form 3-stars based on these connections. Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (9, 2, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. Thus, the answer is [5].
