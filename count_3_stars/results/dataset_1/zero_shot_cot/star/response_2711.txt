Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars based on the given edges. 

- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 9), (9, 0) - forms a 3-star <0, (1, 9)>
- Node 1: (0, 1), (1, 6), (1, 9), (6, 1) - forms two 3-stars <1, (0, 6, 9)> and <1, (6, 0, 9)>
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 8), (4, 3), (5, 3), (8, 3) - forms one 3-star <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 4: (3, 4), (4, 7), (4, 9), (7, 4), (9, 4) - forms one 3-star <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: (1, 6), (5, 6), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 5), (7, 6) - forms one 3-star <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: (2, 7), (4, 7), (6, 7), (7, 4) - forms one 3-star <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
