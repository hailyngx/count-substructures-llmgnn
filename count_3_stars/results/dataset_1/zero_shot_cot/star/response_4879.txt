Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

Starting with node 1:
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 3 and 4, forming two potential 3-stars: <1, (3, 4)>.
  
Moving on to node 2:
- Node 2 has an edge with node 7, but it's not part of a 3-star structure.
  
Node 3:
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7, forming four potential 3-stars: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>.
  
Node 4:
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 1 and 7, forming a potential 3-star: <4, (1, 7)>.
  
Node 5:
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 3 and 8, forming a potential 3-star: <5, (3, 8)>.
  
Node 6:
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 3 and 7, forming a potential 3-star: <6, (3, 7)>.
  
Node 7:
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8, forming five potential 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>.
  
Node 8:
- Node 8 has an edge with node 5, but it's not part of a 3-star structure.

Finally, counting the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (3, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 7)>, <5, (3, 8)>, <6, (3, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
