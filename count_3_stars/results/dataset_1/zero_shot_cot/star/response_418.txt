Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars, which consist of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to it by edges. 
Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For each node in the graph, check if it has exactly three neighbors. These nodes have the potential to be the centers of 3-stars.

2. For each node that has exactly three neighbors, check if these neighbors form a 3-star around it by being connected to each other through the center node.

Based on the given graph, the nodes that have exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 2:
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>

2. For Node 3:
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>

3. For Node 4:
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>

4. For Node 5:
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>

5. For Node 8:
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>.
