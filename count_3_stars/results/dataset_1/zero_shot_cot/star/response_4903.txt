Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

The possible center nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Step 2: For each center node, count the number of 3-stars that can be formed.

- Center node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 8) [3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>]
- Center node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 0, 6), (1, 0, 7) [3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>]
- Center node 2: (2, 0, 3) [3-star: <2, (0, 3, 6)>]
- Center node 3: Not applicable (as it's connected to only 2 nodes)
- Center node 4: (4, 0, 6), (4, 0, 7) [3-stars: <4, (0, 6, 7)>]
- Center node 6: (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 4), (6, 1, 7), (6, 1, 8), (6, 1, 9), (6, 2, 3), (6, 2, 4), (6, 2, 7), (6, 2, 8), (6, 4, 7), (6, 4, 8), (6, 4, 9), (6, 7, 8) [3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>]
- Center node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 1, 6), (7, 1, 8) [3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>]
- Center node 8: (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 6), (8, 0, 7) [3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>]
- Center node 9: Not applicable (as it's connected to only 1 node)

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found, taking into account each unique center node and its corresponding leaves.

The total number of 3-stars: 22

[The final answer: [22]]
