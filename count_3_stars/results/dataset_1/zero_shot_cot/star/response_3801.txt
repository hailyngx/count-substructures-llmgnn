Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected to them.

Looking at the graph and given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <3, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <4, (3, 7, 5)>
3. <5, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <6, (3, 5, 9)>
5. <7, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
