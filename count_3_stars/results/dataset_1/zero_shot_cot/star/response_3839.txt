Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three adjacent edges. These nodes correspond to the central nodes of 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 3, 4)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, -)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
