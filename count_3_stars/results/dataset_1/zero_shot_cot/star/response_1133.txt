Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
6. Node 5 is connected to node 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9. <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 8. <3, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 7. <4, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, and <4, (5, 6, 7)>.
