Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, X)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 9, X)>
<9, (4, 8, X)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
