Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

In a 3-star, there is one central node and three leaf nodes connected to it. Since there are 10 nodes in the graph, any node can be the central node. So, there are 10 possibilities for the central node.

2. Next, identify the 3-star configurations for each central node:

- For central node 0: no 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 edges.
- For central node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- For central node 2: no 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 edges.
- For central node 3: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- For central node 4: no 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 edges.
- For central node 5: <5, (0, 1, 9)>
- For central node 6: no 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 edges.
- For central node 7: no 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 edges.
- For central node 8: no 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 edges.
- For central node 9: no 3-star can be formed as it has fewer than 3 edges.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:

<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>].
