Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, -)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, -)>
<4, (9, -, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (2, -, -)>
<7, (2, 8, -)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get: [9].
