Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars that exist in the graph.

Given the graph, let's list the possible 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (4, 8, 9)
2. Node 1: (3, 7, unknown) - No third node connected to node 1.
3. Node 2: (5, 7, 9)
4. Node 3: (1, 5, 8)
5. Node 4: (0, 6, unknown) - No third node connected to node 4.
6. Node 5: (2, 3, 8)
7. Node 6: (4, unknown, unknown) - No other connected nodes to node 6.
8. Node 7: (1, 2, 8)
9. Node 8: (0, 3, 5)
10. Node 9: (0, 2, 5)

From the list above, we can see that there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
