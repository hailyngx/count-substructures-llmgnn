Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5

Now, let's count the 3-stars by identifying the central node and its connected nodes:
1. Central node: 7
Connected nodes: 1, 4, 6
<7, (1, 4, 6)>

2. Central node: 5
Connected nodes: 7, 8, 9
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

3. Central node: 2
Connected nodes: 4, 6, 8
<2, (4, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
