Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, -)>
- <3, (0, 5, -)>
- <4, (8, -, -)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (0, 7, -)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (0, 1, 7)>

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
