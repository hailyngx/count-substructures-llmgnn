Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars in it:

1. Total Nodes: 10
2. Total Edges: 30

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, the central node of each 3-star will have 3 edges connected to it. We will look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:

- Nodes with 3 edges connected: 
    - Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 5)
    - Node 1 (connected to nodes 4, 7, 8)
    - Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 9)
    - Node 3 (connected to nodes 4, 6, 7)
    - Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 8)
    - Node 6 (connected to nodes 3, 7, 9)
    - Node 7 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 6)
    - Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 5, 1)
    - Node 9 (connected to nodes 4, 6, 1)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:
   - <0, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <2, (0, 5, 9)>
   - <3, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (0, 2, 8)>
   - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
   - <7, (1, 3, 6)>
   - <8, (0, 5, 1)>
   - <9, (4, 6, 1)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [9]
