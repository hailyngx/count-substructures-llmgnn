Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the node 0, as it will serve as the central node for the 3-stars. 
The nodes connected to node 0 are: 5, 6, 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. For node 0:
   - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
   
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
