Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to understand that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From the given edges, we can observe that nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, and 9 have degree 3, and these nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
