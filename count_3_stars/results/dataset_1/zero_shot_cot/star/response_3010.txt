Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have degree 5, while nodes 2, 9 have degree 2, and node 3 has degree 4.

2. Let's identify the 3-stars centered at each node:
    - Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>
    - Node 1: <1, (0, 5, 3)>
    - Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 5)>
    - Node 5: <5, (0, 3, 8)>
    - Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)>
    - Node 8: <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>
    - Node 9: <9, (8, 3, 0)>

3. Counting the total number of 3-stars: [9].

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
