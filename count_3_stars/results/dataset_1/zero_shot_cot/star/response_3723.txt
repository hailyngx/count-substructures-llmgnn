Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the Central Nodes   
In a 3-star graph, the central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the central nodes in the given graph based on this criterion:  
Central nodes: 1, 2, 4

Step 2: Find 3-Stars   
For each central node, check the nodes it is connected to and see if they form a 3-star pattern.  
Let's look at each central node:

For central node 1:  
Connections: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9)  
<1, (3, 6, 9)>

For central node 2:  
Connections: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8)  
<2, (4, 5, 6)>  
<2, (4, 7, 8)>

For central node 4:  
Connections: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)  
<4, (2, 3, 5)>  
<4, (2, 7, 8)>  
<4, (3, 5, 9)>

Step 3: Count the Unique 3-Stars   
Count the unique 3-stars identified above:  
Total count of 3-stars: [6]

Final Answer: [6]  
Unique 3-Stars: <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>
