Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the edges provided, we can start by examining each node to see if it satisfies the definition of a 3-star. 

Let's examine each node and list the 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 9, 5)>
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get: <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
