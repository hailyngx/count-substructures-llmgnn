Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (1, 2, 0)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 6)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
