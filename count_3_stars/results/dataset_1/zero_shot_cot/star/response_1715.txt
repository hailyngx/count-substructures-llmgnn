Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.

- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 2: 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 9
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 5
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
We can count the number of 3-stars by looking for nodes that meet this criteria.

From the list above, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (8, 9)>
<1, (5, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 5)>
<8, (0, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Total number of unique 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
