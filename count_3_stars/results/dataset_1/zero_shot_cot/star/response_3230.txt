Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify nodes that are part of 3-stars.

Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we need to find nodes with 3 neighbors in the graph. Let's identify such nodes:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, and <4, (5, 6, 7)>.
