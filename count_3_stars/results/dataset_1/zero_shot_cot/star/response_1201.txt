Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the graph. These are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

Central nodes: 1, 2, 4, 9

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
