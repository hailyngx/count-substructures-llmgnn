Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to form 3-stars. We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (6, 7)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
