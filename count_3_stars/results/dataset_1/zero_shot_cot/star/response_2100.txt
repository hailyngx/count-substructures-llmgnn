Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (0)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Since each 3-star is counted for every unique central node, the total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
