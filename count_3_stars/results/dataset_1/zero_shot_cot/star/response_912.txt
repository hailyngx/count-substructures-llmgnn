Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 9, _)>
<4, (3, 9, _)>
<5, (1, 7, _)>
<6, (0, 1, _)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, _)>
<9, (3, 4, _)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
