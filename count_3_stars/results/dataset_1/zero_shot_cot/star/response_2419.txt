Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 8, 2)>
<2, (0, 8, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (8, 6, 5)>
<5, (3, 2, 7)>
<6, (8, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
