Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) -> <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. Node 3: (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) -> <3, (1, 2, 7)>
3. Node 7: (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) -> <7, (0, 2, 3)>
4. Node 8: (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) -> <8, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, and <8, (0, 3, 5)>.
