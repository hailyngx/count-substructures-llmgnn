Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

1. Starting with node 0 as the central node:
    - <0, (2, 3, 6)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <0, (2, 3, 9)>
    
2. Moving to node 1 as the central node:
    - <1, (2, 9, 0)>

3. Next, we move to node 2 as the central node:
    - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 7)>
    - <2, (0, 3, 9)>
    
4. Continuing with node 3 as the central node:
    - <3, (0, 2, 7)>
    - <3, (0, 2, 9)>
    
5. Moving to node 6 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars can be formed as node 6 is only connected to node 0.
    
6. Moving to node 7 as the central node:
    - <7, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (0, 3, 9)>
    
7. Moving to node 8 as the central node:
    - No 3-stars can be formed as node 8 is only connected to nodes 0 and 7.
    
8. Finally, we move to node 9 as the central node:
    - <9, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <9, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [11], and they are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (2, 9, 0)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>.
