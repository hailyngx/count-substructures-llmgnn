Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the provided edge list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <1, (4, 6, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
