Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8) - <1, (2, 4, 8)>
2. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 9) - <2, (1, 9, -)>
3. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 6) - <3, (5, 6, -)>
4. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, -) - <4, (1, -, -)>
5. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7) - <5, (3, 4, 7)>
6. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 9) - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
7. Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9) - <7, (5, 9, -)>
8. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6) - <8, (0, 1, 6)>
9. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) - <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
