Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all nodes connected to the center node (degree = 3)  
- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)  
  
Step 2: For each node from Step 1, find all possible 3-stars  
<0, (3, 4, 5)>  
<0, (3, 4, 6)>  
<0, (4, 5, 6)>  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
  
Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars
