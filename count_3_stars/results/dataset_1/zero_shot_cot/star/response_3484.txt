Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3 is the center of the following 3-stars:
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>

2. Node 4 is the center of the following 3-stars:
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<4, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>

3. Node 5 is the center of the following 3-stars:
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 4)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [12]
