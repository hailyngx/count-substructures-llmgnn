Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 9)
   - <0, (3, 6, 9)>

2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 7)
   - <1, (4, 7, 1)>

3. Node 2: (2, 8)
   - No 3-star centered at node 2

4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 5)
   - <3, (0, 4, 5)>

5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 8)
   - <4, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <4, (3, 0, 5)>
   - <4, (5, 1, 8)>
   - <4, (1, 7, 8)>

6. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
   - <5, (3, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (4, 6, 7)>
   - <5, (6, 0, 5)>
   - <5, (4, 1, 8)>
   - <5, (4, 7, 8)>

7. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 5)
   - No 3-star centered at node 6

8. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 8)
   - <7, (1, 5, 8)>

9. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7)
   - <8, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <8, (4, 1, 5)>
   - <8, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <8, (1, 4, 7)>

10. Node 9: (9, 0)
   - No 3-star centered at node 9

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
