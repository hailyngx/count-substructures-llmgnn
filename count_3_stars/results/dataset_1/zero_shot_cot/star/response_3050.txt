Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Given the information provided:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.

Now we can list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
