Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 8)
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (0, 8)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 7, 8)
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5, 7)

2. For each node with three neighbors, check if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with (2, 4, 6), (3, 6, 8), and (4, 8, 6)
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (0, 6, 8) and (5, 8, 9)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (0, 6, 8)
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 8) and (2, 8, 9)

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
