Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to the center in each possible 3-star in the graph. 

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to node 8.

Starting from node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.

Starting from node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.

Starting from node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.

Starting from node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.

Starting from node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4.

Starting from node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4.

Starting from node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to node 1.

Starting from node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 9.

Starting from node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 8.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 
- From node 0: 1 3-star
- From node 1: 1 3-star
- From node 2: 1 3-star
- From node 3: 1 3-star
- From node 4: 1 3-star
- From node 5: 1 3-star
- From node 6: 1 3-star
- From node 7: 1 3-star
- From node 8: 1 3-star
- From node 9: 1 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
  
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (8)>
<1, (3, 7)>
<2, (6, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 4)>
<6, (2, 4)>
<7, (1)>
<8, (0, 3, 4, 9)>
<9, (2, 8)>
