Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Given the edges provided, we can start by listing the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (2, 7, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we can see that there are 5 unique 3-stars listed above.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
