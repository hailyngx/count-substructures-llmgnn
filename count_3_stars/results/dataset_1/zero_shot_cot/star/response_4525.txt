Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Start by identifying the nodes that are central nodes in the 3-stars. These are nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges:
   - Node 0 has 3 incident edges (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)
   - Node 2 has 3 incident edges (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 8)
   - Node 5 has 3 incident edges (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6)
   - Node 8 has 3 incident edges (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5)

Now, we can form the unique 3-stars based on the central nodes and their connected nodes:

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
