Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars:

<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
