Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 6)>
2. <2, (4, 7, 9)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
4. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
5. <8, (0, 4, 9)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [5].
