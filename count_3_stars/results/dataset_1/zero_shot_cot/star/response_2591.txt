Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node 
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 7: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph
- To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Counting the number of such configurations helps us find the number of 3-stars.

Step 3: Determining the 3-stars
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars
- Counting the unique 3-stars identified above gives us the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Output: 
[8]
