Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

From the edge list:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 8, and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8

We can observe the following 3-star graphs:
1. <0, (2, 5, 9)>
2. <2, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (2, 3, 8)>
4. <5, (0, 2, 6)>
5. <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
