Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8. 
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7.

Now, we can construct the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. <0, (6, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (2, 7, 8)>
4. <5, (4, x, x)> (In this case, x represents an unknown node since there's no information about the connected node to 5)
5. <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
