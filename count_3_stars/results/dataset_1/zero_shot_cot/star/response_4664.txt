Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9 have 3 incident edges each. Therefore, these are the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Let's analyze the 3-stars for each potential central node:

For node 0:
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
Total: 1

For node 1:
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
Total: 1

For node 4:
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
Total: 1

For node 9:
- <9, (0, 8, 0)> (Note: This 3-star is counted twice due to the same edges being incident on node 9 as on node 0)
Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
