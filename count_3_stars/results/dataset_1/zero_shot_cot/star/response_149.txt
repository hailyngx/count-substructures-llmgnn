Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars mentioned above, we get a total of [6].
