Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 9, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
