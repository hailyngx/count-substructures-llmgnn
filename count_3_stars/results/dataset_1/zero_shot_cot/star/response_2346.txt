Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 8, 9)>
5. <4, (5, 8, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 4, 9)>
7. <6, (2, 7, 0)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 6)>
9. <8, (1, 3, 4)>
10. <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
