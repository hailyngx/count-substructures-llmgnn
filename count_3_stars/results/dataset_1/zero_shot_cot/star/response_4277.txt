Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. We need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.
2. We then need to count the unique 3-stars formed by these nodes.

Let's follow these steps:

Nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 0, 7
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [5].
