Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 as these can be potential central nodes of 3-stars. The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are: 2, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's examine each of these nodes as potential central nodes of 3-stars and see if they are indeed connected to exactly three other nodes.

For central node 2:
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
  Total = 2

For central node 7:
- <7, (3, 5, 9)>
  Total = 1

For central node 8:
- <8, (4, 2, 5)>
- <8, (4, 5, 2)>
  Total = 2

For central node 9:
- <9, (2, 7, 9)>
  Total = 1

[Total 3-stars: 6]
