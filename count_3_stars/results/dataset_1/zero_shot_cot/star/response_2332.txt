Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

The center nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's identify the leaves for each center node:

- Center 0: (3, 5, 6, 9)
- Center 1: (2, 4, 6, 7)
- Center 2: (1, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Center 3: (0, 6)
- Center 4: (1, 2, 6, 7, 8)
- Center 5: (0)
- Center 6: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Center 7: (1, 2, 4)
- Center 8: (4)
- Center 9: (0, 2)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 5, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (1, 4, 6, 7, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 6)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 6, 7, 8)>, 
<5, (0)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<8, (4)>, 
<9, (0, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
