Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's list down the 3-stars found inside <>: 

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [7].
