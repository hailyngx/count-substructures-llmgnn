Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (6, 9, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 5)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
