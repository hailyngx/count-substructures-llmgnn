Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes that are connected in such a way that they form 3-star structures. 

1. Node 2 is the central node in the following 3-stars:
   <2, (0, 4, 5)>
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   <2, (5, 7, 9)>
  
2. Node 3 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <3, (5, 9, -)>
   
3. Node 4 is the central node in the following 3-stars:
   <4, (2, 5, 7)>
   <4, (5, 7, 6)>

4. Node 5 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <5, (2, 4, 6)>
   
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [6].
