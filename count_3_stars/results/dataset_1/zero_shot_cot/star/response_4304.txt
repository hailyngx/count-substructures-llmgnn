Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found on the graph and place the answer inside brackets: [5].
