Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

In this case, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: Does not have 3 edges connected to it.
2. Node 1: Does not have 3 edges connected to it.
3. Node 2: Has 4 edges connected to it: (1,2), (2,3), (2,5), (2,6).
4. Node 3: Has 3 edges connected to it: (2,3), (3,4), (3,6).
5. Node 4: Has 4 edges connected to it: (0,4), (3,4), (4,7), (4,8).
6. Node 5: Does not have 3 edges connected to it.
7. Node 6: Has 4 edges connected to it: (2,6), (3,6), (6,7), (6,9).
8. Node 7: Has 3 edges connected to it: (4,7), (6,7), (7,8).
9. Node 8: Does not have 3 edges connected to it.
10. Node 9: Does not have 3 edges connected to it.

Therefore, based on the given graph, we have found the following 3-stars:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
