Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Identify nodes with 3 connections:
    - Node 1 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 3.
    - Node 2 has connections with nodes 1, 5, and 7.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star:
    - Node 1: (1, 0, 2, 3) - Not a 3-star because 0 is not directly connected to 3.
    - Node 1: (1, 2, 3, 4) - Not a 3-star because 4 is not directly connected to 3.
    - Node 1: (1, 3, 4, 6) - Not a 3-star because 6 is not directly connected to 3.
    - Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 4) - Not a 3-star because 0 is not directly connected to 4.

    - Node 2: (2, 1, 5, 7) - Not a 3-star because 7 is not directly connected to 5.
    - Node 2: (2, 1, 5, 8) - Not a 3-star because 8 is not directly connected to 5.
    - Node 2: (2, 1, 5, 9) - Not a 3-star because 9 is not directly connected to 5.
    - Node 2: (2, 5, 6, 9) - Not a 3-star because 6 is not directly connected to 5.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [0].
