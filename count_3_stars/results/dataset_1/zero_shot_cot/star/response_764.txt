Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges.

Identifying such nodes:
- Node 0 has 4 edges
- Node 1 has 1 edge
- Node 2 has 1 edge
- Node 3 has 2 edges
- Node 4 has 1 edge
- Node 5 has 5 edges
- Node 6 has 2 edges
- Node 7 has 3 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 9 has 5 edges

Nodes with exactly three edges are 7 and 8. Let's form 3-stars with these nodes as centers:

<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<7, (0, 5, 8)>  
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
