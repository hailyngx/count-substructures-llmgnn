Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 has 4 connections: 1, 2, 6, 7.
   As it has exactly three connections excluding itself, node 0 is the center of a 3-star. 
   <0, (1, 2, 6)>

2. Node 1 has 5 connections: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8.
   As it has exactly three connections excluding itself, node 1 is the center of a 3-star.
   <1, (0, 2, 5)>

3. Node 2 has 4 connections: 0, 1, 9.
   As it has fewer than 3 connections excluding itself, it's not the center of a 3-star.

4. Node 3 has 3 connections: 4, 7, 9.
   As it has exactly three connections excluding itself, node 3 is the center of a 3-star.
   <3, (4, 7, 9)>

5. Node 4 has 3 connections: 3, 9.
   As it has fewer than 3 connections excluding itself, it's not the center of a 3-star.

6. Node 5 has 3 connections: 1, 8, 9.
   As it has exactly three connections excluding itself, node 5 is the center of a 3-star.
   <5, (1, 8, 9)>

7. Node 6 has 1 connection: 0.
   As it has fewer than 3 connections excluding itself, it's not the center of a 3-star.

8. Node 7 has 4 connections: 0, 1, 3, 8.
   As it has exactly three connections excluding itself, node 7 is the center of a 3-star.
   <7, (0, 1, 3)>

9. Node 8 has 3 connections: 1, 5, 7.
   As it has fewer than 3 connections excluding itself, it's not the center of a 3-star.

10. Node 9 has 4 connections: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
    As it has exactly three connections excluding itself, node 9 is the center of a 3-star.
    <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
