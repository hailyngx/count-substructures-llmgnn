Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are the potential centers for 3-stars. These nodes will be the centers of our 3-stars if they are connected to three other nodes.

The potential central nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

#### For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
- So, <0, (1, 2, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 0.

#### For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- So, <1, (0, 2, 3)> is a 3-star centered at node 1.
- So, <1, (0, 4, 5)> is another 3-star centered at node 1.

#### For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.
- So, <2, (0, 1, 6)> is a 3-star centered at node 2.
- So, <2, (1, 3, 5)> is another 3-star centered at node 2.
- So, <2, (0, 3, 5)> is another 3-star centered at node 2.

#### For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- So, <3, (1, 2, 5)> is a 3-star centered at node 3.

#### For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- So, <4, (1, 8, 9)> is a 3-star centered at node 4.

#### For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- So, <5, (1, 2, 3)> is a 3-star centered at node 5.

#### For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
- So, <6, (0, 2, 7)> is a 3-star centered at node 6.

#### For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, and 9.
- So, <8, (0, 6, 9)> is a 3-star centered at node 8.

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
