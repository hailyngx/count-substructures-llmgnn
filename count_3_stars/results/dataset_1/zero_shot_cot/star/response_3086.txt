Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the center node of each potential 3-star.

Potential center nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Step 2: For each center node, identify its adjacent nodes. Check if each pair of adjacent nodes is connected to each other, forming a 3-star.

Let's go through each potential 3-star one by one:

1. Center node 0: Adjacent nodes are 1, 3, and 8. 
   - Check if (1, 3), (1, 8), and (3, 8) are edges. 
   - Only (1, 3) is an edge, so no 3-star with center node 0.

2. Center node 1: Adjacent nodes are 0, 6, and 7.
   - Check if (0, 6), (0, 7), and (6, 7) are edges.
   - Only (0, 7) is an edge, so no 3-star with center node 1.

3. Center node 2: Adjacent nodes are 4, 7, and 9.
   - Check if (4, 7), (4, 9), and (7, 9) are edges.
   - Only (4, 7) is an edge, so no 3-star with center node 2.

4. Center node 3: Adjacent nodes are 0 and 4.
   - Check if (0, 4) is an edge.
   - (0, 4) is indeed an edge, so a 3-star is found: <3, (0, 4)>

5. Center node 4: Adjacent nodes are 2 and 3.
   - Check if (2, 3) is an edge.
   - (2, 3) is not an edge, so no 3-star with center node 4.

6. Center node 5: Adjacent nodes are 6, 7, and 8.
   - Check if (6, 7), (6, 8), and (7, 8) are edges.
   - Only (6, 7) is an edge, so no 3-star with center node 5.

7. Center node 6: Adjacent nodes are 1 and 5.
   - Check if (1, 5) is an edge.
   - (1, 5) is indeed an edge, so a 3-star is found: <6, (1, 5)>

8. Center node 7: Adjacent nodes are 1, 2, and 5.
   - Check if (1, 2), (1, 5), and (2, 5) are edges.
   - (1, 5) is an edge, so no 3-star with center node 7.

9. Center node 8: Adjacent nodes are 0, 5, and 9.
   - Check if (0, 5), (0, 9), and (5, 9) are edges.
   - Only (0, 5) is an edge, so no 3-star with center node 8.

10. Center node 9: Adjacent nodes are 2 and 8.
   - Check if (2, 8) is an edge.
   - (2, 8) is indeed an edge, so a 3-star is found: <9, (2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<3, (0, 4)>, <6, (1, 5)>, <9, (2, 8)>]
