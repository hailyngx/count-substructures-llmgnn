Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes of the 3-stars. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we will look for nodes in the graph that have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 1 (neighbors: 3, 5, 9)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7)

Next, we will construct the 3-stars. Let's list them:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>

There are **4** 3-stars in this graph. 
Thus, the final answer is [4].
