Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Since it is connected to only 3 other nodes (2, 4, 5), there is one 3-star <0, (2, 4, 5)>.

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9. It is part of the previously identified 3-star with node 0.

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8. Since it is connected to only 3 other nodes (0, 1, 5), there is another 3-star <4, (0, 1, 5)>.

4. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. It is also part of the 3-star identified above with node 4.

5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8. It is part of the 3-star identified above with node 0.

6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9. Since node 6 is connected to more than 3 other nodes, it does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. Since it is connected to only 3 other nodes (5, 6, 8), there is another 3-star <3, (5, 6, 8)>.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9. It is part of the 3-star identified above with node 3.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It is part of the 3-star identified above with node 0.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, and 7. Since it is connected to only 3 other nodes (0, 2, 6), there is another 3-star <9, (0, 2, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars identified are <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, and <3, (5, 6, 8)>.
