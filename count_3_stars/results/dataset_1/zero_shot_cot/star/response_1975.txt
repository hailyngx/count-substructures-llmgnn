Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all possible 3-stars by considering each node as the center and its adjacent nodes as leaves. 

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
