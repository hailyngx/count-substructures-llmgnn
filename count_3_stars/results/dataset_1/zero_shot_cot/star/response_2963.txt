Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all possible triangles in the graph. Since a 3-star is a specific type of triangle where one node is connected to all other nodes, we need to find triangles where one node has connections to all other nodes in the triangle.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12] (inside brackets).
