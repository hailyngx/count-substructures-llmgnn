Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes in the set.
Let's find the 3-star structures in the given graph:
1. <0, (1, 2, 9)> 
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)> 
3. <2, (0, 6, 7)> 
4. <4, (1, 7, 9)> 
5. <5, (1, 3, 0)> 
6. <6, (2, 7, 8)> 
7. <7, (2, 4, 6)> 
8. <9, (0, 1, 4)> 

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
