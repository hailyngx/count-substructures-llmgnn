Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form a 3-star. In this case, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars:
1. <2, (0, 3, 3)>
2. <3, (2, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
4. <5, (4, 8, 9)>
5. <6, (1, 7, 7)>
6. <7, (6, 6, 6)>
7. <8, (4, 5, 8)>
8. <9, (3, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
