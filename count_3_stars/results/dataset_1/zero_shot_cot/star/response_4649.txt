Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves connected to it, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 5)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 6)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 7)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 2, 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 3, 4)
- Node 9 (connected to node 3)

Next, we can list the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 7, *not connecting to any other node*)>
- <6, (2, 8, *not connecting to any other node*)>
- <7, (3, 4, *not connecting to any other node*)>

Since there are 6 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [6].
