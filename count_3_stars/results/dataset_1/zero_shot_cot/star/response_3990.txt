Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (1, 0, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 1)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique 3-stars:
[7]
