Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by checking each node as a potential center and counting the number of 3-star configurations around it.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
