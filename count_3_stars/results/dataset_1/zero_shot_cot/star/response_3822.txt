Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 8)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (1, 3, 4)>
7. <6, (0, 7, 9)>
8. <7, (2, 4, 5)>
9. <8, (1, 5, 9)>
10. <9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [10].
