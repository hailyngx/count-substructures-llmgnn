Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. The central nodes must have exactly three neighbors. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, and 4 have 4 neighbors each.  
Hence, we need to look closer at nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9 to find the central nodes. 

Looking at the available edges, we see that nodes 2 and 7 have 6 neighbors each, while node 9 has 5 neighbors. Node 8 has only 1 neighbor, so it cannot be a central node. 
Therefore, the central nodes of the 3-stars are node 2, node 5, and node 9. 

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node to form the 3-stars. 
- For node 2: (2, 0, 7), (2, 1, 5), (2, 3, 4)
- For node 5: (5, 1, 9), (5, 2, 4)
- For node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 4, 5), (9, 8, 0)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<2, (0, 7, 1)>, <2, (1, 5, 2)>, <2, (3, 4, 2)>, <5, (1, 9, 5)>, <5, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (8, 0, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
