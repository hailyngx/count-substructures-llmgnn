Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8: <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4: <2, (0, 1, 4)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9: <3, (2, 6, 9)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 6: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 7: <5, (4, 6, 7)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 8: <6, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are 6 3-stars in the given graph.

The final answer is [6].
