Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. These nodes will act as the center of 3-star graphs.
   
2. For each of these nodes, identify the three nodes that they are connected to and construct the 3-stars.

In this graph:
- Node 2 and Node 4 have 3 incident edges each.
- For Node 2, the three nodes it is connected to are 1, 3, and 4, forming a 3-star with Node 2 as the center. (<2, (1, 3, 4)>)
- For Node 4, the three nodes it is connected to are 2, 6, and 8, forming another 3-star with Node 4 as the center. (<4, (2, 6, 8)>)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
