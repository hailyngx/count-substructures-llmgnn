Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are part of a 3-star configuration. In a 3-star, a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges in the graph:
- 3-star centered at node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 9)
- 3-star centered at node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (1, 2)
- 3-star centered at node 3: (3, 2), (3, 7), (2, 3)
- 3-star centered at node 6: (6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 9)
- 3-star centered at node 7: (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8)
- 3-star centered at node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7)
- 3-star centered at node 9: (9, 1), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Hence, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 1)>
<3, (2, 7, 3)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
