Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
