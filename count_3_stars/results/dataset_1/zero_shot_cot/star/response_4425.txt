Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 1: (1, 3, 8)
- From node 3: (3, 1, 8)
- From node 4: (4, 1, 6) and (4, 6, 9)
- From node 6: (6, 1, 4) and (6, 4, 9)
- From node 8: (8, 1, 3)
- From node 9: (9, 4, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (3, 8, 1)>  
<3, (1, 8, 3)>  
<4, (1, 6, 4)>  
<4, (6, 9, 4)>  
<6, (1, 4, 6)>  
<6, (4, 9, 6)>
