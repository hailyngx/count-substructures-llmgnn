Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected leaves for each 3-star. 

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8. <0, (2, 3, 8)> [1]
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 8. <1, (3, 4, 7)> [2]
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 8. <2, (0, 8, 3)> [3]
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 8. <3, (0, 1, 5)> [4]
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. <4, (1, 5, 6)> [5]
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9. <5, (3, 4, 6)> [6]
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. <6, (4, 5, 6)> [7]
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9. <7, (1, 9, 3)> [8]
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3. <8, (0, 1, 2)> [9]
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7. <9, (1, 3, 5)> [10]

Count: [10]
