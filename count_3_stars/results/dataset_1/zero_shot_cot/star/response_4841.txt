Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4: 3, 5, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs:

1. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
2. <2, (6, 7, 9)>
3. <3, (4, 5, 8)>
4. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
5. <5, (3, 4, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 2, 7)>
7. <7, (0, 2, 4)>
8. <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star subgraphs.
