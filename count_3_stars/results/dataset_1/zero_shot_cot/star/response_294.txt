Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify each 3-star configuration.

Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with 3 incident edges.

Here are the nodes that have 3 incident edges:
- Node 0 has edges (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9)
- Node 1 has edges (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)
- Node 2 has edges (2, 3), (2, 7), (2, 8)
- Node 3 has edges (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5)
- Node 4 has edges (4, 1), (4, 6), (6, 4)
- Node 5 has edges (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7)
- Node 6 has edges (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7)
- Node 7 has edges (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5)
- Node 8 has edge (8, 2)
- Node 9 has edge (9, 0)

We can see that only nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 meet the criteria of being the center of a 3-star.

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:

- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- <4, (1, 6, 4)>
- <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
