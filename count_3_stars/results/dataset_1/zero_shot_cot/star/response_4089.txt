Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

Since there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
