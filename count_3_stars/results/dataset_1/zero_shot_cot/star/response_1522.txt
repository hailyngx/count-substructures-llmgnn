Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A central node in a 3-star graph is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
For this graph, the central nodes are nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, and 8. 

Next, let's find the leaves for each central node. To do this, we need to look for nodes connected to each central node that are not connected to each other. 

- Central node 0: Its leaves are nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Central node 1: Its leaves are nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Central node 2: Its leaves are nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Central node 5: Its leaves are nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Central node 8: Its leaves are nodes 0, 2, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- The 3-star with central node 0: <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- The 3-star with central node 1: <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- The 3-star with central node 2: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- The 3-star with central node 5: <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- The 3-star with central node 8: <8, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
