Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, we identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1
- Node 4: 1, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0

We observe that the degrees of the nodes vary. To form a 3-star, we need to find the nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, we list all possible 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
[]

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, which means the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
