Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 8), (0, 9)
   - Possible 3-stars involving node 0:
     <0, (8, 9)>

2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 9)
   - Possible 3-stars involving node 1:
     <1, (4, 9)>

3. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 6)
   - Possible 3-stars involving node 2:
     <2, (3, 6)>

4. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 6)
   - Possible 3-stars involving node 3:
     <3, (2, 6)>

5. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 7)
   - Possible 3-stars involving node 4:
     <4, (1, 7)>

6. Node 5: (5, 8)
   - No 3-star possible with node 5 as the center.

7. Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9)
   - Possible 3-stars involving node 6:
     <6, (2, 3)>
     <6, (2, 9)>
     <6, (3, 9)>

8. Node 7: (7, 4)
   - No 3-star possible with node 7 as the center.

9. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 5)
   - Possible 3-stars involving node 8:
     <8, (0, 5)>

10. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 6)
    - Possible 3-stars involving node 9:
      <9, (0, 1)>
      <9, (0, 6)>
      <9, (1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (8, 9)>, <1, (4, 9)>, <2, (3, 6)>, <3, (2, 6)>, <4, (1, 7)>, <6, (2, 3)>, <6, (2, 9)>, <6, (3, 9)>, <8, (0, 5)>, <9, (0, 1)>, <9, (0, 6)>, <9, (1, 6)>.
