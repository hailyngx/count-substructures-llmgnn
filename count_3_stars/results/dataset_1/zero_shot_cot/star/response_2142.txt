Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 with neighbors 1, 2, and 5
2. Node 1 with neighbors 0, 3, and 4
3. Node 2 with neighbors 0, 4, and 6
4. Node 3 with neighbors 1, 4, and 5
5. Node 4 with neighbors 1, 2, and 3
6. Node 5 with neighbors 0, 3, and 9
7. Node 6 with neighbors 2 and 9
8. Node 7 with neighbors 1, 2, and 3
9. Node 8 with neighbors 0, 1, and 2
10. Node 9 with neighbors 1, 3, and 4

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have [10]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)> 

So, the answer is [10].
