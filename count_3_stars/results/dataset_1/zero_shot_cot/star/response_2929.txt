Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9 and 0. <0, (5, 9, 0)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7 and 1. <1, (3, 7, 1)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5 and 3. <3, (1, 5, 3)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3 and 5. <5, (0, 3, 5)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8 and 6. <6, (3, 8, 6)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7 and 8. <8, (5, 7, 8)>
7. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2 and 9. <9, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer inside brackets is [7].
