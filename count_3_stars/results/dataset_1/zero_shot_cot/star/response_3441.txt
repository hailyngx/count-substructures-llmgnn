Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-stars in the given graph. 

A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

By observing the graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 9, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 9, 9)>
<6, (9, 9, 1)>
<7, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (4, 4, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

Since these are unique 3-stars, we count them only once.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
