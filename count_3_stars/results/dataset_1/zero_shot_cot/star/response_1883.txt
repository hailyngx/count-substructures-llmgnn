Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes forming a 3-star configuration.

The central node of each 3-star will have degree 3 in the graph. Let's find out which nodes have degree 3:

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 1
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 4

Therefore, nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are potential central nodes for 3-star configurations since their degrees are 3 or more.

Let's check the neighbors of these potential central nodes to find the 3-stars:

1. For node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7)
2. For node 4: (4, 0, 2)
3. For node 5: (5, 1, 2), (5, 2, 6), (5, 2, 7)
4. For node 6: (6, 2, 5), (6, 5, 8)
5. For node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 2, 5), (7, 9, 0)
6. For node 9: (9, 0, 7), (9, 7, 8)

Therefore, there are 11 unique 3-star configurations in the given graph:
<2, (1, 5), (4, 5)>, <2, (5, 6), (7, 2)>, <2, (5, 7), (1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2), (0, 2)>, <5, (1, 2), (2, 6)>, <5, (2, 6), (2, 7)>, <6, (2, 5), (5, 8)>, <7, (0, 2), (2, 5)>, <7, (9, 0), (0, 7)>, <9, (0, 7), (7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
