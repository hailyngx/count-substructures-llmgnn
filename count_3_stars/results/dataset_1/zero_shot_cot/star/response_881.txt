Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by identifying the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (), not a 3-star>
<5, (2, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [9].
