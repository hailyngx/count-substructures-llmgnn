Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 1, Leaves: 3, 7, 0
2. Central node: 2, Leaves: 3, 5, 0
3. Central node: 3, Leaves: 1, 2, 4
4. Central node: 3, Leaves: 1, 2, 6
5. Central node: 3, Leaves: 1, 4, 9
6. Central node: 3, Leaves: 2, 4, 6
7. Central node: 4, Leaves: 3, 5, 9
8. Central node: 5, Leaves: 2, 4, 8
9. Central node: 8, Leaves: 5, 7, 9

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 7, 0)>, 
<2, (3, 5, 0)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<4, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
