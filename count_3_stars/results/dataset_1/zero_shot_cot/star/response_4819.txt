Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Given that a 3-star graph consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the edges provided. 

Looking at the edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 9, -)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, -)>
<7, (3, 5, -)>
<8, (2, -.-)>
<9, (4, -.-, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
