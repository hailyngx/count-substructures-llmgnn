Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph:

Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 6), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 6)

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. For node 1:
   - (1, 7) and (7, 1) form a 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 7 and 2 as leaves. <1, (7, 2)>

2. For node 2:
   - (2, 7), (2, 8), and (2, 9) form 3-stars with node 2 as the center and nodes 7, 8, and 9 as leaves. <2, (7, 8, 9)>

3. For node 3:
   - None of the edges connect to node 3, so no 3-stars can be formed with node 3 as the center.

4. For node 6:
   - (6, 3), (6, 9), and (6, 9) form 3-stars with node 6 as the center and nodes 3 and 9 as leaves. <6, (3, 9)>

5. For node 7:
   - (7, 1), (7, 2), and (7, 8) form 3-stars with node 7 as the center and nodes 1, 2, and 8 as leaves. <7, (1, 2, 8)>

6. For node 8:
   - (8, 2) and (8, 7) form a 3-star with node 8 as the center and nodes 2 and 7 as leaves. <8, (2, 7)>

7. For node 9:
   - (9, 2) and (9, 6) form a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 2 and 6 as leaves. <9, (2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (7, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (2, 7)>
<9, (2, 6)>
