Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star structures in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
