Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Given the edge list provided, we can identify the 3-star configurations in the graph by looking for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. Let's list them step by step:

1. Look for nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. Identify the unique 3-stars from the nodes found in step 1.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's start with step 1:

Nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 6), (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)

Now, let's move to step 2 to identify the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>  
<0, (1, 4, 5)>  
<0, (1, 4, 7)>  
<3, (1, 5, 7)>  
<4, (0, 1, 6)>  
<4, (0, 1, 7)>  
<4, (3, 6, 8)>  
<5, (0, 3, 6)>  
<5, (0, 3, 7)>  
<6, (1, 4, 5)>  
<6, (1, 4, 8)>  
<7, (0, 3, 5)>  
<7, (0, 3, 8)>  
<8, (3, 4, 6)>  
<8, (3, 4, 7)>  

Finally, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars: [15]
