Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. Let's go step-by-step:

1. The central node (center) and its leaf nodes in a 3-star graph are uniquely determined. So, for each node, we will check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

2. For each node that is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we will check if these connections form a 3-star pattern.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
