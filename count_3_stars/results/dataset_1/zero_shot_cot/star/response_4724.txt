Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 1)>
<9, (2, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
