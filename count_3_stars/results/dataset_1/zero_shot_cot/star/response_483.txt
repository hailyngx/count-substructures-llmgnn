Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 4, 8), (0, 8, 9)
- For node 1: (1, 8, 6), (1, 8, 7), (1, 6, 5)
- For node 5: (5, 6, 8), (5, 8, 9)
- For node 9: (9, 7, 5)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (8, 6, 7)>
- <1, (6, 5, 8)>
- <5, (6, 8, 5)>
- <5, (8, 9, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 6)>
- <9, (7, 5, 8)>
