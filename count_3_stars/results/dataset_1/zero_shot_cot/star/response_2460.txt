Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. A central node in a 3-star must have exactly three neighbors. Here are the nodes with three neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7.

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <2, (0, 5, 7)>
2. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
3. <5, (2, 6, 9)>
4. <6, (2, 3, 5)>
5. <7, (0, 1, 5)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [5].
