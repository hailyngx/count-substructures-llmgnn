Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes connected to node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to node 6 and node 9.

2. Identify nodes connected to node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

3. Identify nodes connected to node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

4. Identify nodes connected to node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.

5. Identify nodes connected to node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.

6. Identify nodes connected to node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.

7. Identify nodes connected to node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 9.

8. Identify nodes connected to node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.

9. Identify nodes connected to node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.

10. Identify nodes connected to node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Based on the connections, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (6, 9)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (6, 3, 9)>
- <1, (6, 5, 9)>
- <1, (7, 9, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <7, (1, 9, 8)>
- <8, (1, 9, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 8)>
- <9, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 3, 1)>
- <9, (5, 6, 1)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>

There are 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [21].
