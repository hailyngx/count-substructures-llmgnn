Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find those instances step-by-step.

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes by edges:
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 7, and 7 (duplicate edge).
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 8 (duplicate edge).
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 7, 2, and 8.
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.

2. Counting the 3-stars:
   - <1, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <2, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
