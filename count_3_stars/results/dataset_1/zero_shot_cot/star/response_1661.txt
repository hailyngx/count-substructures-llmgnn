Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Start by listing the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.

2. Now, identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- There are no 3-stars with node 0 as the central node because it has 4 neighbors.
- There is one 3-star with node 1 as the central node: <1, (6, 7, 9)>.
- There are no 3-stars with node 2 as the central node because it has 2 neighbors.
- There are two 3-stars with node 3 as the central node: <3, (0, 4, 9)> and <3, (4, 5, 9)>.
- There is one 3-star with node 4 as the central node: <4, (2, 3, 9)>.
- There are no 3-stars with node 5 as the central node because it has only 1 neighbor.
- There are no 3-stars with node 6 as the central node because it has 4 neighbors.
- There are no 3-stars with node 7 as the central node because it has 3 neighbors.
- There are no 3-stars with node 8 as the central node because it has only 1 neighbor.
- There is one 3-star with node 9 as the central node: <9, (1, 3, 4)>.

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [4].

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, and <9, (1, 3, 4)>.
