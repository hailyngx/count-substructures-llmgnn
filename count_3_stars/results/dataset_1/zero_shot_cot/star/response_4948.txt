Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph.
The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 9.
Now, we will determine the 3-stars in the graph by looking at each central node and its neighbors. 

For central node 0:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 8)> 

For central node 2:
- Neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
- 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 8)>

For central node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>

For central node 4:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 8)> 

For central node 9:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- 3-stars: <9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] and they are <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>.
