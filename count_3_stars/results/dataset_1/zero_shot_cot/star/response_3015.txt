Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {2, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 4}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 9}
- Node 6: {1}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs:

- For node 0: No 3-star is formed because it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 1: No 3-star is formed because it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 2: No 3-star is formed because it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 3: No 3-star is formed because it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 4: One 3-star is formed with central node 4 and leaves 2, 3, and 5. <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- For node 5: No 3-star is formed because it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 6: No 3-star is formed because it has less than 3 connections.
- For node 9: No 3-star is formed because it has less than 3 connections.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is: [1]

Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 3, 5)> [1]
