Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are:  
Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9)  
Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8)  
Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8)  
Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9)  
Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 2)  
Node 9 (connected to nodes 0 and 3, and 5)  

Step 2: For each of these nodes, find the 3-stars they form.

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- Total: 2

For node 1:
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Total: 1

For node 2:
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- Total: 1

For node 5:
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- Total: 2

For node 8:
- <8, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (0, 7, 9)>
- Total: 2

For node 9:
- <9, (0, 3, 5)>
- Total: 1

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
Total 3-stars: 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
