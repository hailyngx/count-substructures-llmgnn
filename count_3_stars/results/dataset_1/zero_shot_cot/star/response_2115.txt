Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 9, 1)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
