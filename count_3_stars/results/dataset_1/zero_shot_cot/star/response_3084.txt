Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, -)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
[6]
