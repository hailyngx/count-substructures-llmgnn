Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the center of the 3-star graphs.

Potential central nodes:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 7)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 5)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 0, 4, 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8)

Step 2: For each potential central node, check if it forms a 3-star with its connected nodes.

3-Star graphs:
- <0, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-star graphs.

Total number of 3-star graphs: 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
