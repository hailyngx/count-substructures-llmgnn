Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will follow these steps:

Step 1: Count the degree of each node.
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 6
- Node 4 has degree 2
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 2

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
- From the degrees, we can see that nodes 0, 7, and 3 are potential centers of 3-stars.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars.
- For node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 6, 7), (0, 7, 8) => 3 3-stars
- For node 7: (7, 2, 8), (7, 5, 3), (7, 0, 6) => 3 3-stars
- For node 3: (3, 1, 2), (3, 7, 5), (3, 0, 6) => 3 3-stars

Step 4: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
- Total number of 3-stars = 3 (from node 0) + 3 (from node 7) + 3 (from node 3) = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 0)>, <0, (6, 7, 0)>, <0, (7, 8, 0)>, <7, (2, 8, 7)>, <7, (5, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 3)>, <3, (7, 5, 3)>, <3, (0, 6, 3)>
