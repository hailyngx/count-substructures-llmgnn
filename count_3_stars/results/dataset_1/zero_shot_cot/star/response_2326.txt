Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 4  
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 6, 7  
Node 2: 1, 5  
Node 3: 5  
Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8, 9  
Node 5: 2, 3, 7, 9  
Node 6: 1, 4  
Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9  
Node 8: 4, 7  
Node 9: 4, 5, 7  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

3-stars centered at:
Node 1: (0, 4, 6), (2, 6, 7)  
Node 4: (0, 6, 8), (0, 6, 9), (1, 6, 8), (1, 6, 9), (2, 6, 8), (2, 6, 9)  
Node 5: (2, 3, 7), (3, 7, 9)  
Node 7: (2, 3, 5), (3, 5, 9)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].  

The unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (0, 4, 6)>  
<1, (2, 6, 7)>  
<4, (0, 6, 8)>  
<1, (2, 6, 7)>  
<4, (0, 6, 8)>  
<4, (0, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 6, 8)>  
<4, (1, 6, 9)>  
<4, (2, 6, 8)>  
<4, (2, 6, 9)>  
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
