Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each set of nodes that form a 3-star. 

Let's examine the graph node by node to identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 3
   - <0, (1, 3)>
   
2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 8, 9
   - <1, (0, 8, 9)>
   
3. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 4, 8
   - <3, (0, 4, 8)>
   
4. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 3, 7, 9
   - <4, (3, 7, 9)>
   
5. Node 7:
   - Connected to node 4
   - No 3-star
   
6. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 3, 9
   - <8, (1, 3, 9)>
   
7. Node 9:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 4, 8
   - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
   
Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 
There are 6 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
