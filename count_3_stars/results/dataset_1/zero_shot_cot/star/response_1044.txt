Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern with itself as the center.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9

From the above connections, we can form the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>

As these are the only unique 3-star patterns present in the given graph, the final answer is [2].
