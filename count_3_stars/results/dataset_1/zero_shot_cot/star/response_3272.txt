Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree = 3) and create a list of their neighbors.

Nodes connected to the center node (degree = 3):
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Given the connections above, there are two possible 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (6, 7, 9)>
2. <6, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
