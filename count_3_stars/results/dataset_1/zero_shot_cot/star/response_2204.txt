Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we need to look for nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.
Nodes with exactly 3 incident edges are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 5)>
<3, (7, 7, 7)>
<6, (5, 5, 5)>
<8, (5, 5, 5)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
