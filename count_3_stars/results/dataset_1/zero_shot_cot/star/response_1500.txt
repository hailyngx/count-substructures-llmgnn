Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to Node 1.
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1 and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (1, 1, 5)> (not unique)
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 3)> (not unique)
- Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 6, 6)> (not unique)

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
