Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique 3-star structures. 

Let's list out the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 1)>
<7, (0, 4, 2)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
