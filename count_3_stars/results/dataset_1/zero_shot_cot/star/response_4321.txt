Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)
  <0, (4, 6, 7)>
  <0, (4, 5, 6)>
  <0, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 1: (1, 7)
  No 3-star centered at node 1.

- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 6)
  <2, (5, 3, 6)>
  
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 5)
  <3, (4, 5, 6)>
  
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 6)
  <4, (0, 3, 6)>
  
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6)
  No new 3-star centered at node 5.

- Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)
  <6, (0, 4, 7)>
  <6, (2, 5, 3)>
  <6, (4, 0, 3)>
  <6, (5, 3, 4)>
  <6, (6, 7, 8)>
  
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 6)
  No new 3-star centered at node 7.

- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 6)
  No 3-star centered at node 8.

- Node 9: (9, 6)
  No 3-star centered at node 9.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 3, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 3)>, <6, (4, 0, 3)>, <6, (5, 3, 4)>, <6, (6, 7, 8)>.
