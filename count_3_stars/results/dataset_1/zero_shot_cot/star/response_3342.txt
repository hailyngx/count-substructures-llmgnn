Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with three or more edges connected to them.  
In this graph, nodes 0, 2, 6, 7 have three or more edges connected to them.  

Step 2: Check if the nodes with three or more edges connected to them form a 3-star.  
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 7)>  
- Node 2 does not form a 3-star as one leaf (node 4) is missing.  
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 9)>  
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 5)>  

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars found.  
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.  

Therefore, the final answer is [3].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 7, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
