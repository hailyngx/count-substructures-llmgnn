Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Given the edges:
(0, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 2), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)

To count the 3-stars, we need to look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will form the center of a 3-star.

In this graph, the following 3-stars can be found:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 9, -)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
