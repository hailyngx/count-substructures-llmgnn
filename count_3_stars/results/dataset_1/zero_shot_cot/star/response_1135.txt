Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify 3-star configurations in the graph  
Step 2: Count the number of 3-star configurations  

Given Graph:  
- 10 nodes, labeled 0 to 9  
- 36 edges  

Let's find the 3-star configurations in the graph:  

1. Nodes with degree:  
   - Node 0: Degree 2  
   - Node 1: Degree 8  
   - Node 2: Degree 4  
   - Node 3: Degree 3  
   - Node 4: Degree 4  
   - Node 5: Degree 5  
   - Node 6: Degree 3  
   - Node 7: Degree 1  
   - Node 8: Degree 5  
   - Node 9: Degree 3  

2. 3-star configurations:  
<1, (0, 4, 6)>  
<1, (2, 4, 8)>  
<1, (5, 4, 8)>  
<1, (7, 2, 3)>  
<1, (9, 0, 4)>  
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
