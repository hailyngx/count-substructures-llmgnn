Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges which represent the center nodes of potential 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three edges are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- For node 2:
    - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 7)>

- For node 3:
    - <3, (0, 2, 7)>

- For node 4:
    - <4, (2, 6, 9)>

- For node 5:
    - <5, (6, 7, 9)>

- For node 7:
    - <7, (2, 5, 6)>

- For node 9:
    - <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
