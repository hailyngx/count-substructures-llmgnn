Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern.

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 8, 1)>
2. <1, (3, 0, 6)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <4, (2, 5, 7)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 7)>
7. <6, (1, 7, 9)>
8. <7, (1, 2, 6)>
9. <8, (0, 6, 9)>
10. <9, (6, 8, 1)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the final answer is [10].
