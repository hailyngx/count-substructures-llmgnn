Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 8)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 9)>
4. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <7, (3, 5, 9)>
6. <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
