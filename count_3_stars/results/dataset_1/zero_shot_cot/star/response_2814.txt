Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially serve as the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0
- Node 6
- Node 9

Step 2: For each of the identified nodes, check if it forms a 3-star by having exactly 3 edges connecting it to other nodes.

<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
