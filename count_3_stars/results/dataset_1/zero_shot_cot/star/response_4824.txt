Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's visualize the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Edges:
- 0 is connected to 6 and 9
- 1 is connected to 6
- 2 is connected to 3
- 3 is connected to 2, 6, and 9
- 4 is connected to 5, 6, 7, and 9
- 5 is connected to 4
- 6 is connected to 0, 1, 3, and 4
- 7 is connected to 4
- 9 is connected to 0, 3, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

[1] There is exactly one 3-star in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].

Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 9)>
