Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connected edges to see the structure of the graph more clearly:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 2, 3
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: (2, 6, 8), (2, 6, 9), (6, 8, 9) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 1: (3, 4, 5), (3, 4, 9), (3, 5, 9) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 2: (0, 6, 9) -> 1 3-star
- Node 3: (1, 6, 7), (1, 6, 8), (6, 7, 8) -> 3 3-stars

[Total number of 3-stars: 10]

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
