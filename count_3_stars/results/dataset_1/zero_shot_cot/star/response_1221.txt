Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

First, let's list down all the nodes in the format (node, degree):
- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 1
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 7

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 4 is the center of a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 9 as leaves <4, (2, 6, 9)>
2. Node 6 is the center of a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9 as leaves <6, (4, 7, 9)>
3. Node 9 is the center of a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7 as leaves <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
