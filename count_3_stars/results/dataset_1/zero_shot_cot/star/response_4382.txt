Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5. (4 edges)
   - Forms 1 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 5)>

2. Node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8. (4 edges)

3. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. (6 edges)
   - Forms 1 3-star: <2, (3, 8, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9. (5 edges)

5. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 9. (4 edges)

6. Node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. (3 edges)

7. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 1 and 3. (2 edges)

8. Node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9. (4 edges)

9. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, and 9. (5 edges)

10. Node 9:
    - Connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8. (5 edges)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
