Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's denote the nodes as follows based on the given information:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations in the graph:
1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 5, 6
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 4, 9
3. Central node: 2, Leaves: 5, 7
4. Central node: 3, Leaves: 8

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6)>
<1, (4, 9)>
<2, (5, 7)>
<3, (8)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
