Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars. We can do this by examining each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star.

For example, Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7. This makes Node 0 the center of a 3-star with leaves 2, 5, and 7. Let's mark this 3-star: <0, (2, 5, 7)>.

Similarly, we can identify the other 3-stars in the graph.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 3, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
