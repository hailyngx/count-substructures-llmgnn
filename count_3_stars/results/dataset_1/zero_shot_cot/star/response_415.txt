Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3.
In this graph, nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have degree 3.

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, find its neighbors.
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 2, 6
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 9
- Node 9 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.
- For node 2: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 8), (0, 4, 7), (0, 4, 8), (0, 7, 8), (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 8), (1, 7, 8)
  Total: 9 3-stars centered at node 2
- For node 3: (1, 6, 9)
  Total: 1 3-star centered at node 3
- For node 6: (3, 7, 9)
  Total: 1 3-star centered at node 6
- For node 7: No 3-stars as it doesn't have three distinct neighbors.
- For node 8: (0, 2, 9)
  Total: 1 3-star centered at node 8
- For node 9: (3, 5, 6)
  Total: 1 3-star centered at node 9

Step 4: Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
Total 3-stars: 9 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 13

[13] 
Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>
