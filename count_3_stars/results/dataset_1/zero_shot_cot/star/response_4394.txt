Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 0: Connected to 1 node (Degree = 1)
- Node 1: Connected to 5 nodes (Degree = 5)
- Node 2: Connected to 6 nodes (Degree = 6)
- Node 3: Connected to 6 nodes (Degree = 6)
- Node 4: Connected to 1 node (Degree = 1)
- Node 5: Connected to 4 nodes (Degree = 4)
- Node 6: Connected to 5 nodes (Degree = 5)
- Node 7: Connected to 4 nodes (Degree = 4)
- Node 8: Connected to 2 nodes (Degree = 2)
- Node 9: Connected to 3 nodes (Degree = 3)

It can be observed that only Node 9 has a degree of 3. Therefore, there is only one 3-star in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
