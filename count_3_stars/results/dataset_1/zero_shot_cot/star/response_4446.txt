Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node for each potential 3-star in the graph:

- Node 0 has neighbors 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 1, 5, 9
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 6, 8
- Node 5 has neighbor 2
- Node 6 has neighbors 1, 4
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 1
- Node 8 has neighbors 0, 1, 4
- Node 9 has neighbor 2

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 unique 3-star: <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 forms 1 unique 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star
- Node 4 does not form any 3-star
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of 2 3-stars in the given graph.
