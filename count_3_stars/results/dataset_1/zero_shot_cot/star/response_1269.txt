Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars.
In this graph, we are looking for nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes.
The potential central nodes are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Step 2: For each potential central node, check if it is indeed the center of a 3-star.
Let's go through each potential central node:
1. For node 0:
    - (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 5) form a 3-star <0, (1, 2, 4)>
2. For node 1:
    - (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3) form a 3-star <1, (0, 2, 3)>
    - (1, 8), (1, 9) cannot form a 3-star because node 1 has more than 3 neighbors.
3. For node 4:
    - (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5) form a 3-star <4, (0, 2, 5)>
    - (4, 6), (4, 8) do not form a 3-star because node 4 has more than 3 neighbors.
4. For node 5:
    - (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 9) form a 3-star <5, (0, 4, 9)>
5. For node 6:
    - (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9) form a 3-star <6, (4, 7, 9)>
6. For node 8:
    - (8, 1), (8, 4) do not form a 3-star because node 8 has more than 3 neighbors.
7. For node 9:
    - (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5) form a 3-star <9, (1, 3, 5)>
    - (9, 6) do not form a 3-star because node 9 has more than 3 neighbors.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
