Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 7, 6)>
<3, (6, 6, 4)>
<5, (7, 7, 4)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
