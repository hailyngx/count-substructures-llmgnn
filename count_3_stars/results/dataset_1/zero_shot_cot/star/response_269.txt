Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 has no 3-star.
- Node 1 has a 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 has no 3-star.
- Node 3 has three 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 has a 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- Node 5 has no 3-star.
- Node 6 has a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 7 has no 3-star.
- Node 8 has a 3-star: <8, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 has two 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
