Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Let's identify them one by one.

1. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
2. <3, (1, 7, 9)>
3. <4, (1, 6, -)>
4. <6, (4, 5, 9)>
5. <7, (3, 9, -)>
6. <9, (6, 7, -)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
