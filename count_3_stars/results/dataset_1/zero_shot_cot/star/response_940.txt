Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, *)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, *)>
<8, (0, 9, *)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[5]
