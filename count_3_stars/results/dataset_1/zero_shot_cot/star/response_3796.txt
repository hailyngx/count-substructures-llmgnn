Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

The central node of a 3-star will be the node with exactly three edges connected to it. Therefore, we will identify all nodes in the graph that have exactly three incident edges.

Nodes with exactly three incident edges are: 1, 2, 6, 8

Now, we will check the connections of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars. 

When we check the connections, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>.
