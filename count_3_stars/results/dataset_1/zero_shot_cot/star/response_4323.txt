Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central node in a 3-star graph must have degree 3. From the given edge list, nodes 0, 1, and 2 have degree 3.

Now, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node:

For node 0:
- Leaves connected to node 0 are 1, 2, and 5.

For node 1:
- Leaves connected to node 1 are 0, 5, and 8.

For node 2:
- Leaves connected to node 2 are 0, 7, and 9.

Next, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Now, let's list all the unique 3-star configurations:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>

Since each of these unique 3-star configurations can occur at most once in the given graph, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
