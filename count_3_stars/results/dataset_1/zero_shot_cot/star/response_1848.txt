Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that act as centers and their adjacent nodes. We can see that nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are the potential centers.

Looking at the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes, we can now count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. Let's denote the central nodes by their numbers.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, n)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 8, n)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, n)>
<8, (1, 3, n)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
