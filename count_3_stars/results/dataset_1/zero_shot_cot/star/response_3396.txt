Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.

Next, we can count the number of 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 8. <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7. <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 9. <8, (5, 1, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and 8. <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
