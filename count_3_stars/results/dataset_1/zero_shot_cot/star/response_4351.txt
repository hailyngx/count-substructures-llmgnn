Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's first list down the nodes along with the nodes they are connected to:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.

Now, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<7, (8, 9, 0)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (3, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above gives us a total of [17].
