Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes can be considered as the center of a 3-star. In this case, any node with exactly three neighbors is a potential center for a 3-star.

From the given graph, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each potential center:

For node 0:
- <0, (1, 2, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 1:
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (3, 9, 4)>

For node 2:
- No 3-stars as node 2 has only two neighbors.

For node 6:
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 9, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 9, 4)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 9, 5)>.
