Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3)
2. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7)
3. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 7)
4. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 7)
5. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)
6. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 5)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
