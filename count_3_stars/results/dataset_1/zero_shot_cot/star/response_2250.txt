Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 4, 8
Node 1: 0, 5, 7, 9
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 2, 9
Node 5: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 3, 5
Node 7: 1, 5
Node 8: 0
Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms one 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 1 forms two 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 7)> and <1, (5, 9, 4)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- Node 5 forms three 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, and <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 5, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in this graph.
