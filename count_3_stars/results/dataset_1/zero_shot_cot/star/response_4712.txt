Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from node 0:
   - 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 4, 5, 7 as the leaves <0, (4, 5, 7)>

2. Moving on to node 1:  
   - 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 4, 8, 9 as the leaves <1, (4, 8, 9)>

3. Moving on to node 2: No 3-star because it has only 2 edges (2, 3) and (2, 7).

4. Moving on to node 3:
   - 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 0, 1, 2 as the leaves <3, (0, 1, 2)>
   - 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 5, 7, 9 as the leaves <3, (5, 7, 9)>

5. Moving on to node 4:
   - 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 0, 1, 5 as the leaves <4, (0, 1, 5)>
   - 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 6, 7, 9 as the leaves <4, (6, 7, 9)>

6. Moving on to node 5: No 3-star because it has only 3 edges (5, 0), (5, 3), and (5, 4).

7. Moving on to node 6:
   - 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 4, 7, 9 as the leaves <6, (4, 7, 9)>

8. Moving on to node 7:
   - 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 0, 2, 3 as the leaves <7, (0, 2, 3)>
   - 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 4, 6, 9 as the leaves <7, (4, 6, 9)>

9. Moving on to node 8: No 3-star because it has only 2 edges (8, 1) and (8, 9).

10. Moving on to node 9:
   - 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 1, 3, 5 as the leaves <9, (1, 3, 5)>
   - 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 4, 6, 7 as the leaves <9, (4, 6, 7)>


Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
