Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <1, (6, 9)>
2. <2, (4, 7)>
3. <6, (1, 8)>
4. <7, (2, 9)>
5. <8, (6)>
6. <9, (1, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
