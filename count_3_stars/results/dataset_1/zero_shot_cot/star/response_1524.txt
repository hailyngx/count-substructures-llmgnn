Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 edges connected to them, as they can potentially be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. These nodes are: 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-stars that can be formed with these nodes as the centers:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 3, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>

By counting these unique 3-stars, we find that there are [5] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
