Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star.

In this graph, the central node of a 3-star must have degree 3 and the other three nodes should be directly connected to this central node. 

Let's first identify all the nodes with degree 3:
- Node 0 has degree 3 (connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7).
- Node 3 has degree 7 (connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9).
- Node 8 has degree 4 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9).
- Node 9 has degree 4 (connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9).

Now, let's list all the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (8, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 
So, the final answer is [4].
