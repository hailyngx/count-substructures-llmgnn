Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0, Leaves: 1, 4, 5
2. Central node: 1, Leaves: 0, 3, 8
3. Central node: 2, Leaves: 5, 6
4. Central node: 3, Leaves: 1, 8
5. Central node: 4, Leaves: 0, 6, 9
6. Central node: 5, Leaves: 0, 2
7. Central node: 6, Leaves: 2, 4, 7
8. Central node: 8, Leaves: 0, 3, 9
9. Central node: 9, Leaves: 4, 8

Count of 3-stars: [9]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (5, 6)>, <3, (1, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 2)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (4, 8)>
