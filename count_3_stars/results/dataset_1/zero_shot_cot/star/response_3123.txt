Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
   - Node 0: 4, 6
   - Node 1: 6
   - Node 2: 3, 8
   - Node 3: 2, 5, 7
   - Node 4: 0, 5
   - Node 5: 3, 4
   - Node 6: 0, 1, 8, 9
   - Node 7: 3
   - Node 8: 2, 6
   - Node 9: 6

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - From the node list, identify 3-stars:
     - <0, (4, 6)>
     - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
     - <6, (0, 1, 8)> 
   
   - Count the unique 3-stars: [3] 
   
3. List of unique 3-stars:
   - <0, (4, 6)>
   - <3, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (0, 1, 8)> [\3\]
