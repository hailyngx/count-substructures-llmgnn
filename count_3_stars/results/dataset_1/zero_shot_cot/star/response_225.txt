Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze this graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, we identify all nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 7
- Node 1: 6, 8
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 5, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Next, we look for 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with leaves 5, 9 (star: 4, (5, 9))
- Node 5 can form two 3-stars: with 4, 9 (star: 5, (4, 9)) and with 7, 9 (star: 5, (7, 9))
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with leaves 5, 8 (star: 7 ,(5, 8))
- Node 8 can form two 3-stars: with 1, 9 (star: 8, (1, 9)) and with 7, 9 (star: 8, (7, 9))

Putting the unique 3-stars found together, we have:
<4, (5, 9)>, <5, (4, 9)>, <5, (7, 9)>, <7, (5, 8)>, <8, (1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
