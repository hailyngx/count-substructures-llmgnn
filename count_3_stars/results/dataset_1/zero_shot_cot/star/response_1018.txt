Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first define a 3-star as described in the prompt. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars by locating the central node and the three connected nodes for each star. 

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step: 

1. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 8)
   - <1, (4, 8)>

2. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 7)
   - <2, (5, 7)>

3. Node 3: (3, 5)
   - No 3-star centered at node 3. 

4. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 8)
   - <4, (1, 6, 8)>

5. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3)
   - No 3-star centered at node 5.

6. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8)
   - <6, (4, 7, 8)>

7. Node 7: (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 8)
   - <7, (2, 6, 8)>

8. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)
   - <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 8)>, <2, (5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>
