Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

Since we have identified 6 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
