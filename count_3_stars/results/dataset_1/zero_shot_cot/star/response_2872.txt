Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break this down step-by-step.

**Step 1:** Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and a 3-star <1, (0, 6, 8)>.
- Node 2 is connected to only one other node.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and a 3-star <3, (0, 8, 9)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and a 3-star <4, (7, 0, 8)>.
- Node 5 is connected to only one other node.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and a 3-star <6, (1, 0, 2)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and a 3-star <7, (4, 0, 8)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and a 3-star <8, (0, 3, 8)>.
- Node 9 is connected to only one other node.

**Step 2:** Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <4, (7, 0, 8)>
- <6, (1, 0, 2)>
- <7, (4, 0, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 8)>

Since there are six unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [6].
