Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. Then we will determine how many unique 3-stars exist in the graph.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

Let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, -)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, -)>
<6, (1, 9, -)>
<9, (6, -,-)>

There are a total of [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
