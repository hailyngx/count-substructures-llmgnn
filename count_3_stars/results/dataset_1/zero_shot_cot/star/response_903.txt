Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (2, 7, 1)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 2)>
4. <4, (2, 9, 2)>
5. <5, (3, 7, 9)>
6. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
7. <9, (4, 5, 6)>
  
After listing the unique 3-stars, we count them to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
