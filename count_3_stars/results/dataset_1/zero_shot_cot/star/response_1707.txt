Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the center node and its adjacent nodes. 

From the given edges, we can see that the node with the most adjacent nodes is node 4 with 7 edges. Therefore, node 4 is the center node in this graph.

Next, let's determine all the 3-stars in the graph by looking at the edges connected to the center node. 

The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
