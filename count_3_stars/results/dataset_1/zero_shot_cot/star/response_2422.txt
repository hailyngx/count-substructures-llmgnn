Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
