Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

A 3-star consists of a central node and exactly three other nodes connected to the central node. 

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph: 

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [14].
