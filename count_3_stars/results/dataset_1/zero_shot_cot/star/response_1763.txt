Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the edges, we can see that there are several potential 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify them:

1. <0, (5, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (5, 8, 1)>
3. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <4, (6, 0, 8)>
5. <4, (7, 0, 8)>
6. <6, (0, 4, 8)>
7. <8, (0, 4, 6)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
