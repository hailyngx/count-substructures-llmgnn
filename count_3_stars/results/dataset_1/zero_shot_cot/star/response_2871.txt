Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list down the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4. So, the corresponding 3-star is <2, (3, 4)>.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8. So, the corresponding 3-stars are <3, (2, 7)> and <3, (2, 8)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].  
The unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 4)>, <3, (2, 7)>, and <3, (2, 8)>.
