Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.  
These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

The nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 6, and 8)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5)

Step 2: For each of the identified central nodes, list the connected nodes to form the 3-stars.

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
