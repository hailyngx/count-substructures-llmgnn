Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 

In this graph, the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7)

Step 2: For each potential center, find all the unique 3-stars.

For Node 0:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 6:
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 7:
- <7, (0, 2, 6)>
- [1 unique 3-star]

For Node 8:
- <8, (0, 6, 7)>
- [1 unique 3-star]

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars: [5]
