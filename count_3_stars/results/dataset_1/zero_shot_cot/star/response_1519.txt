Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the cases where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6: 
    - Central node: 0
    - Leaves: 2, 3, 6
    - <0, (2, 3, 6)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7:
    - Central node: 1
    - Leaves: 4, 7
    - <1, (4, 7)>

3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9:
    - Central node: 3
    - Leaves: 0, 9
    - <3, (0, 9)>

4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 8:
    - Central node: 4
    - Leaves: 1, 8
    - <4, (1, 8)>

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8, and 9:
    - Central node: 7
    - Leaves: 1, 5, 8
    - <7, (1, 5, 8)>
    
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9:
    - Central node: 8
    - Leaves: 4, 7, 9
    - <8, (4, 7, 9)>

7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8:
    - Central node: 9
    - Leaves: 3, 5, 7
    - <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (4, 7)>, <3, (0, 9)>, <4, (1, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>
