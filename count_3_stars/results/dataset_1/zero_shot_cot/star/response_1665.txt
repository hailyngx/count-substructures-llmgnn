Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique combinations of 3-star patterns in the graph. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (2, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <1, (5, 6, 9)>

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (0, 7, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 7, 9)>

5. Node 5:
   - <5, (1, 7, 9)>

6. Node 6:
   - <6, (1, 7, 9)>

7. Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <7, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 8)>

8. Node 8:
   - <8, (4, 7, 9)>

9. Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [13].
