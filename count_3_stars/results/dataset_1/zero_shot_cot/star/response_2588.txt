Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three neighbors. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can see that the nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Among these, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
