Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star has a center connected to three other nodes by edges, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes that meet this criteria:
- Node 2 has edges connecting to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 5 has edges connecting to nodes 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 has edges connecting to nodes 4 and 8.
- Node 7 has edges connecting to nodes 0, 2, and 9.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph based on these nodes:

1. <2, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <5, (2, 3, 8)>
3. <6, (4, 8)>
4. <7, (0, 2, 9)>

Count: [4]
