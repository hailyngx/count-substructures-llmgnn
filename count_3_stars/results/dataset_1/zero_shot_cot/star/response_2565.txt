Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's start by looking for all possible 3-stars:

1. Possible 3-stars involving node 0:
<0, (5, 7, 2)>

2. Possible 3-stars involving node 1:
<1, (4, 2, 3)>

3. Possible 3-stars involving node 2:
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (7, 5, 0)>

4. Possible 3-stars involving node 3:
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (8, 6, 7)>

5. Possible 3-stars involving node 4:
<4, (1, 2, 3)>

6. Possible 3-stars involving node 5:
<5, (2, 0, 7)>

7. Possible 3-stars involving node 6:
<6, (7, 8, 3)>

8. Possible 3-stars involving node 7:
<7, (4, 2, 6)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

9. Possible 3-stars involving node 8:
<8, (3, 6, 7)>

10. Possible 3-stars involving node 9:
<9, (3, 7, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found.
