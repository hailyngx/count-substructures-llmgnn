Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. Since the center is connected to exactly three other nodes, we are looking for nodes with degree 3 in this graph. 
The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9.

Next, for each of these central nodes, we can find the 3-stars by looking at their neighbors. 

For central node 0:
- Leaves: 2, 3, 4 <0, (2, 3, 4)>

For central node 2:
- Leaves: 0, 7, 8 <2, (0, 7, 8)>

For central node 4:
- Leaves: 0, 1, 8 <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- Leaves: 8, 9, 1 <4, (8, 9, 1)>

For central node 7:
- Leaves: 2, 5, 9 <7, (2, 5, 9)>
- Leaves: 5, 6, 9 <7, (5, 6, 9)>

For central node 9:
- Leaves: 3, 4, 7 <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- Leaves: 4, 8, 7 <9, (4, 8, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (8, 9, 1)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (4, 8, 7)>.
