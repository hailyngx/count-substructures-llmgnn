Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5, but it has two edges (0, 4) and (0, 5), not forming a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5 and 8, but it has two edges (1, 5) and (1, 8), not forming a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to node 8 through the edge (2, 8) but does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 9 through edges (3, 7) and (3, 9), not forming a 3-star.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9. The edges (4, 0), (4, 2), and (4, 9) form a 3-star <4, (0, 2, 9)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6. The edges (5, 0), (5, 1), and (5, 6) form a 3-star <5, (0, 1, 6)>.
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with node 5: <6, (5, 0, 1)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9. The edges (7, 3), (7, 8), and (7, 9) form a 3-star <7, (3, 8, 9)>.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7. The edges (8, 1), (8, 2), and (8, 7) form a 3-star <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7. The edges (9, 3), (9, 4), and (9, 7) form a 3-star <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (5, 0, 1)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>
