Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are four 3-stars in the given graph. 

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, -)>
<8, (2, 4, -)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
