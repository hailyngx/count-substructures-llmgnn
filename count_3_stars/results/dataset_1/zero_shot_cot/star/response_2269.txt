Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph. Here they are listed below:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 6, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
