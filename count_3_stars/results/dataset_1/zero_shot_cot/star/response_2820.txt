Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 7, -)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, -)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, - , -)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (5, 9, -)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Since each 3-star is uniquely defined by its center node and leaf nodes, we listed them only once. 

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are a total of [10] 3-stars.
