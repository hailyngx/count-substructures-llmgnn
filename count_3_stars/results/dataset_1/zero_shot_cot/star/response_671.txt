Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- The center node (0) is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5: <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- The center node (1) is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6: <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- The center node (2) is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8: <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- The center node (5) is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9: <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- The center node (8) is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9: <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- The center node (9) is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4: <9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
