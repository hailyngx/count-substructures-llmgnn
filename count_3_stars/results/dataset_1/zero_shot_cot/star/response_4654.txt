Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connections. 

Central nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8)
- Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 0), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)
- Node 2 has 2 edges: (2, 0), (2, 9)
- Node 3 has 2 edges: (3, 4), (3, 7)
- Node 4 has 2 edges: (4, 3), (4, 8)
- Node 5 has 1 edge: (5, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8)
- Node 7 has 5 edges: (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9)
- Node 8 has 6 edges: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)
- Node 9 has 2 edges: (9, 2), (9, 7)

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 9, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (3, 8, 7)>
<5, (8, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
