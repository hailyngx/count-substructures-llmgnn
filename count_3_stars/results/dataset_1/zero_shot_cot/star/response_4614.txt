Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's analyze the connections of each node:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes: 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes: 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes: 0 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes: 1, 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes: 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes: 2 and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to 2 nodes: 0 and 6.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
