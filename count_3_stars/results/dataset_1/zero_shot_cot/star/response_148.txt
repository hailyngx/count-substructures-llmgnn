Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, -)>
<5, (-, 9, -)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (6, -, -)>
<8, (1, 2, -)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
