Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7)
2. Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)
3. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 6)
4. Node 4: (4, 2)
5. Node 5: (5, 2)
6. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8)
7. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 9)
8. Node 8: (8, 6)
9. Node 9: (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 9)>
<2, (3, 1, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 1)>
<6, (3, 1, 8)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in this graph.
