Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8. This forms one 3-star with (0, 1, 5, 6) as the unique set of nodes. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
  
Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9. 
- We already counted the star centered at 0 with leaves 1, 5, and 6.
- There are two more 3-stars: one with (1, 3, 4, 7) and another with (1, 8, 9, 4). <1, (3, 4, 7)> and <1, (8, 9, 4)>
  
Moving to the remaining nodes:
- Nodes 2, 5, 6, 9 do not form any additional 3-stars.
- Node 3 is part of the star <1, (3, 4, 7)> which we already counted.
- Node 4 is part of stars <1, (3, 4, 7)> and <1, (8, 9, 4)> which we already counted.
- Node 7 is part of stars <1, (3, 4, 7)> and <1, (8, 9, 4)> which we already counted.
- Node 8 is part of stars <0, (1, 5, 6)> and <1, (8, 9, 4)> which we already counted.
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. Inside brackets: **[3]**.
