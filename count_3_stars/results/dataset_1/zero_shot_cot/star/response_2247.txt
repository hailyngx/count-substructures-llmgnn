Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph and then count them. 

Let's identify the 3-stars first:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 0, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 0, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 3, 6)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars identified above:
