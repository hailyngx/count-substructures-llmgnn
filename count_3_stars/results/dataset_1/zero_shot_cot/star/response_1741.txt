Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify such 3-stars from the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 9)>
4. <5, (1, 6, 1)>
5. <6, (5, 8, 1)>
6. <8, (0, 2, 6)>
7. <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
