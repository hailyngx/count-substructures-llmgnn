Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

By analyzing the edges provided, we can identify the nodes with three edges connected to them:

Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)
Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 9)
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 9)
Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- From Node 0: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- From Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- From Node 8: <8, (0, 3, 9)>
- From Node 9: <9, (0, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
