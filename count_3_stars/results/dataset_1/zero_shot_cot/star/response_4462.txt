Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them (excluding self-loops). Then, we will count how many instances of these unique 3-stars exist in the graph.

1. Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 
   - Node 1
   - Node 2
   - Node 3

2. Identify the 3-stars involving these central nodes:
   - For Node 1: (1, 4, 8), (1, 4, 8)
   - For Node 2: (2, 7, 4)
   - For Node 3: No 3-star as there are more or fewer than three edges connected to Node 3.

3. Count the number of instances of each unique 3-star:
   - <1, (4, 8, 1)> [2 instances]
   - <2, (7, 4, 2)> [1 instance]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
