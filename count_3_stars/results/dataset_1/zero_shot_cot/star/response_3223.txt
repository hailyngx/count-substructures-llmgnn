Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[4]
