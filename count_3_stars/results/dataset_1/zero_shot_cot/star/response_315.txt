Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.
