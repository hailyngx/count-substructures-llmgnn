Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided. In this case, each 3-star will have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Create a list of nodes connected to each node:
   - Node 0: 1, 4, 7
   - Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 9
   - Node 2: 6
   - Node 3: 1, 4, 8, 9
   - Node 4: 0, 3
   - Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8
   - Node 6: 2, 5
   - Node 7: 0, 5, 8
   - Node 8: 3, 5, 7
   - Node 9: 1, 3

2. Identify the 3-stars:
    - 3-star 1: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
    - 3-star 2: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
    - 3-star 3: <3, (1, 4, 9)>
    - 3-star 4: <5, (1, 6, 7)>

3. Count the number of 3-stars found: [4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
