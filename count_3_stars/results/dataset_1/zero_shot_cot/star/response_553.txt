Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
The given graph is as follows:

```
    1 -- 2
    |    |
    3 -- 4 -- 6
   /|    |    |
0  9    7    8
   \     \
    5     0
```

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
