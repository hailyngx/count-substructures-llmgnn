Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We can do this by examining each node and checking its neighbors.

1. Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 4, 8). It forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 8)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 2, 6, 7). However, none of these connections form a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to 2 other nodes (1, 6), which does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes (5, 7, 9). It forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 7, 9)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 5, 6). It forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 5, 6)>.
6. Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes (3, 4, 7). It forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 7)>.
7. Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 2, 4). It forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 3, 5). It forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 5)>.
9. Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes (0, 6), which does not form a 3-star.
10. Node 9 is connected to 1 other node (3), which does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, and <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
