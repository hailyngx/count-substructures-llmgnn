Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (0, 8, -)>
4. <5, (0, 1, -)>
5. <7, (1, 6, 8)>
6. <8, (3, 4, 7)>
7. <9, (0, 1, -)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
