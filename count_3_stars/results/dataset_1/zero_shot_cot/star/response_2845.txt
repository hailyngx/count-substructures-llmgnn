Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can serve as the center of a 3-star.

Looking at the list of edges, we can see that nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 have degree 5, and nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 9 have degree 2 or 3. 

Now, let's count the 3-stars by considering each potential center node:

- For center node 0: There are no 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- For center node 1: There are no 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- For center node 2: <2, (0, 3, 5)> is one 3-star.
- For center node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)> is one 3-star.
- For center node 4: <4, (3, 5, 7)> is one 3-star.
- For center node 5: <5, (2, 3, 8)> and <5, (3, 4, 8)> are two 3-stars.
- For center node 8: <8, (2, 3, 9)> is one 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, and <8, (2, 3, 9)>.
