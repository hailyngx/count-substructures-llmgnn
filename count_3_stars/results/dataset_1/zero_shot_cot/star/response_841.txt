Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

Nodes with three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 (edges with nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 1 (edges with nodes 5, 9)
- Node 4 (edges with nodes 6, 7, 8)
- Node 6 (edges with nodes 0, 4, 5, 9)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

<1, (5, 9)>

<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>

<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>

Count of unique 3-stars: 11
