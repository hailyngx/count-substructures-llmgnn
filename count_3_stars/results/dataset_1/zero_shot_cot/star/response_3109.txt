Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's start by finding all the 3-stars:

<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4].
