Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (6, 9, 0)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
