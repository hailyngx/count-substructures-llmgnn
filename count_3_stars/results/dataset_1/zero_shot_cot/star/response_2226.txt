Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

To form a 3-star, we look for nodes that have degree 3, meaning they are connected to three other nodes. 

After analyzing the given graph, we find that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7 have degree 3. Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 8, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
