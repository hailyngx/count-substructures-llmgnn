Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with the highest degree in the graph, which are nodes 1 and 4 with degree 5 each. Since a 3-star has the center connected to exactly three other nodes, nodes 1 and 4 are candidates to be centers of 3-stars. 

Let's analyze the possible 3-stars:

1. For node 1:
   - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <1, (5, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (5, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 9)>

2. For node 4:
   - <4, (0, 3, 7)>
   - <4, (0, 7, 8)>
   - <4, (3, 7, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
