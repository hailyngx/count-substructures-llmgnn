Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Based on the nodes found above, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
