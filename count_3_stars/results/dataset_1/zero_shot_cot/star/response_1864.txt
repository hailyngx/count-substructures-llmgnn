Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 9, and 5 (*Note: 5 already counted from Node 0)
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 7 and 8

2. Now, count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)> (with Node 5 as the center)
- <4, (7, 9, 5)> (with Node 7 as the center) 
- <6, (7, 8, 9)> (ignoring Node 5 as it's already counted)
- <6, (8, 7, 9)> (same 3-star as above but combination order different)

3. Final count:
- Total number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
