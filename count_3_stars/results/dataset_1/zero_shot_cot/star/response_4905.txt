Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. We need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
