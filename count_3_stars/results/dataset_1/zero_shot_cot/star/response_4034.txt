Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to node 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 5.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 6. <4, (0, 8, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 3 and 9. <5, (3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
