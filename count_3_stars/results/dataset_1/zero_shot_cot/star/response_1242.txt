Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0, connected to nodes 2, 5, 8:
    <0, (2, 5, 8)>

2. Node 1, connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, 9:
    <1, (4, 6, 7)>
    <1, (4, 6, 9)>
    <1, (4, 7, 9)>
    <1, (6, 7, 9)>

3. Node 2, connected to nodes 0, 3, 7:
    <2, (0, 3, 7)>

4. Node 3, connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6:
    <3, (2, 4, 5)>
    <3, (2, 4, 6)>
    <3, (2, 5, 6)>

5. Node 4, connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, 9:
    <4, (1, 3, 6)>
    <4, (1, 6, 8)>
    <4, (1, 6, 9)>
    <4, (1, 8, 9)>
    <4, (3, 6, 8)>
    <4, (3, 6, 9)>
    <4, (3, 8, 9)>

6. Node 5, connected to nodes 0, 3, 6:
    <5, (0, 3, 6)>
    <5, (3, 6, 0)>

7. Node 6, connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5:
    <6, (1, 3, 5)>
    <6, (1, 3, 4)>
    <6, (1, 3, 6)>
    <6, (1, 4, 5)>
    <6, (1, 4, 6)>
    <6, (1, 5, 6)>

8. Node 7, connected to nodes 1, 2, 9:
    <7, (1, 2, 9)>

9. Node 8, connected to nodes 0, 4:
    <8, (0, 4, 1)>

10. Node 9, connected to nodes 1, 4, 7:
    <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, the answer is [15]. The unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>.
