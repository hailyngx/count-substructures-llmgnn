Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with at least three edges incident on them.

Nodes with at least three incident edges:
- Node 0 has 5 incident edges
- Node 3 has 5 incident edges
- Node 8 has 6 incident edges

Next, we examine the neighbors of the potential central nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

For Node 0:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)> - forms a 3-star

For Node 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 5)> - forms a 3-star
- <3, (0, 5, 8)> - forms a 3-star

For Node 8:
- <8, (0, 1, 6)> - forms a 3-star
- <8, (3, 4, 9)> - forms a 3-star

Count of 3-stars: [4]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 6)>
