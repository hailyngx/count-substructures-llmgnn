Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that meet this criteria. Let's find and list the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
