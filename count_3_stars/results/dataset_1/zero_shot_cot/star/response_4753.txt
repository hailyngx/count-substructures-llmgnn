Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the nodes connected to each node and then determine how many 3-stars are present. 

Node 0: (2, 3, 5, 9)
Node 2: (0, 4)
Node 3: (0, 4, 7, 8, 9)
Node 4: (2, 3, 5, 6, 9)
Node 5: (0, 4, 9)
Node 6: (4, 8)
Node 7: (3, 8)
Node 8: (3, 6, 7)
Node 9: (0, 3, 4, 5)

Let's list out the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>

Counting unique 3-stars: [5]
