Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

The 3-stars can be formed with the following nodes as the center and leaves:
1. Center: 0, Leaves: 3, 7
2. Center: 2, Leaves: 6, 7, 8
3. Center: 3, Leaves: 0, 1, 6
4. Center: 4, Leaves: 7, 9
5. Center: 6, Leaves: 2, 3, 5, 8
6. Center: 7, Leaves: 0, 2, 4, 8
7. Center: 8, Leaves: 2, 5, 6, 7
8. Center: 9, Leaves: 2, 4

Therefore, there are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
