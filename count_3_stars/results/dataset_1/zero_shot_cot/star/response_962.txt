Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify and list all unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 9, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 7)>

There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
