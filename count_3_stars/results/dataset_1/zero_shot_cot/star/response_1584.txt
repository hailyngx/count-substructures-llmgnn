Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.  
    - Node 2 is connected to 3, 5, and 8.  
    - Node 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5.  
    - Node 5 is connected to 0, 2, and 3.  
    - Node 7 is connected to 1, 4, and 9.  

Step 2: Check each identified node to see if they form a 3-star.  
    - Nodes 2, 3, and 5 form a 3-star with central node 2.  
    - Nodes 2, 3, and 5 form a 3-star with central node 5.  
    - No 3-star is formed using nodes connected to 7.  

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.  
    - <2, (3, 5, 8)>  
    - <5, (0, 2, 3)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
