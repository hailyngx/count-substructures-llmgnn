Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we will check the connections of these nodes to form the 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes: 0, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes: 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes: 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-stars present in the given graph:
1. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
2. <4, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <7, (0, 2, 6)>
4. <9, (1, 3, 4)>
5. <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and put the final answer in brackets:
