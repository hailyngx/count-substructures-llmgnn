Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Central nodes in this graph will be the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify the central nodes based on this criteria:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 4.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
