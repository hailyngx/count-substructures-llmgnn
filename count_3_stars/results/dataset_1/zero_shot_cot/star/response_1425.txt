Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 9, 9)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (2, 7, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 7)>
6. <5, (1, 8, 9)>
7. <7, (3, 4, 8)>
8. <8, (2, 3, 5)>
9. <9, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
