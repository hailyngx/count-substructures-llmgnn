Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node

- Node 0: connected to nodes 3 and 5
- Node 1: connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 2: connected to node 1
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9
- Node 4: connected to node 8
- Node 5: connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 8
- Node 6: connected to node 9
- Node 7: connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9
- Node 8: connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5
- Node 9: connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

[7]
