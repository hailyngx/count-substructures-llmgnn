Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 7
- Node 1: 4, 5
- Node 2: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 2

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph: 

1. <0, (4, 7, 1)>
2. <1, (4, 5, 0)>
3. <1, (4, 5, 8)>
4. <2, (4, 7, 0)>
5. <2, (4, 7, 9)>
6. <4, (0, 1, 5)>
7. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
8. <4, (2, 5, 0)>
9. <4, (5, 0, 1)>
10. <5, (1, 4, 8)>
11. <5, (4, 1, 0)>
12. <5, (8, 4, 1)>
13. <6, (7, 8, 0)>
14. <6, (8, 7, 5)>
15. <7, (0, 2, 6)>
16. <7, (2, 6, 0)>
17. <8, (5, 6, 1)>
18. <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
