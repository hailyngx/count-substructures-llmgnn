Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly three incident edges are the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9 are the central nodes as they each have exactly three incident edges.

Next, let's list the neighbors of each central node to form the unique 3-stars:

- For node 0: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- For node 2: <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- For node 4: <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- For node 9: <9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
