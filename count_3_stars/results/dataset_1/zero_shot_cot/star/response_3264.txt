Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

- Node 0 has 5 edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)
  - <0, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 3, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <0, (3, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9)
  - <1, (4, 8, 9)>
  
- Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4)
  - <2, (0, 3, 4)>
  
- Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 9)
  - <3, (0, 2, 9)>
  
- Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 7)
  
- Node 5 has 2 edges: (5, 8), (5, 9)

- Node 6 has 2 edges: (6, 7), (6, 8)

- Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8)

- Node 8 has 6 edges: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9)

- Node 9 has 5 edges: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [11].
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>.
