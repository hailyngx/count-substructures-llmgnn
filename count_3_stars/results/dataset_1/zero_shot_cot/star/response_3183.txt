Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-star patterns:

<0, (6, 7, 4)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (5)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-star patterns, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the graph.
