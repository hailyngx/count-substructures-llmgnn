Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 5, 6)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <4, (0, 1, 7)>
5. <5, (1, 3, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
  
Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:  
[6]
