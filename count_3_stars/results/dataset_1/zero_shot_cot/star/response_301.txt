Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes with their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 2, 3, 5  
Node 1: 5, 8, 9  
Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9  
Node 3: 0, 2, 5  
Node 4: 5, 6  
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9  
Node 6: 2, 4  
Node 7: 2, 8  
Node 8: 1, 7  
Node 9: 1, 2, 5  

From the list above, we can see that there are two 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
