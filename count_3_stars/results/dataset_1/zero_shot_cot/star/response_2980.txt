Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars. 
Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected in the pattern: center node - leaf node - leaf node - leaf node. 

There are three different 3-star configurations possible:
1. (0, 3, 5, 6)
2. (2, 3, 4, 7)
3. (5, 4, 6, 9)

Now, let's count the occurrences of these unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 7)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>

We see that each unique 3-star appears only once in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
