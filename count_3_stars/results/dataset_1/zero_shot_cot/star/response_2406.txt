Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 7
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1, 2

Now, we can see that there are four 3-stars in this graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
