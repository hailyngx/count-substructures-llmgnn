Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (3, 4, 8)>
3. <3, (0, 2, 6)>
4. <3, (2, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 6)>
6. <6, (3, 4, 5)>
7. <7, (1, 2, 5)>
8. <7, (2, 5, 6)>
9. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
