Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. The central node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
   <0, (1, 4, 5)>
   <0, (1, 4, 7)>
   <0, (1, 4, 9)>
   <0, (4, 5, 7)>
   <0, (4, 5, 9)>

2. The central node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
   <1, (0, 3, 8)>

3. The central node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
   <3, (1, 4, 6)>

4. The central node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
   <4, (0, 2, 3)>
   <4, (0, 3, 9)>
   <4, (2, 3, 9)>

5. The central node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 7.
   <5, (0, 6, 7)>

6. The central node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
   <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
