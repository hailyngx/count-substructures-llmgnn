Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to determine the possible 3-stars involving node 0 as the center:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 2 to determine the possible 3-stars involving node 2 as the center:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.

Based on the connections, we can form the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
