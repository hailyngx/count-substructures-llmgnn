Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify 3-stars in the given graph:

- The center node is node 0: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 8)
- The center node is node 1: (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 5)
- The center node is node 2: (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 9)
- The center node is node 3: (3, 8), (3, 9)
- The center node is node 4: (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6)
- The center node is node 5: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 8)
- The center node is node 6: Not a 3-star as it has only one edge.
- The center node is node 7: (7, 2), (7, 8)
- The center node is node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7)
- The center node is node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 5, 7)>, <9, (2, 3)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
