Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central node for each potential 3-star by looking for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 8)  
Node 2 has 5 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7, 8)  
Node 3 has 2 neighbors (2, 7)  
Node 4 has 1 neighbor (7)  
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6)  
Node 6 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 8)  
Node 7 has 6 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9)  
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 9)  
Node 9 has 2 neighbors (7, 8)  

Therefore, nodes 5 and 6 are the only nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, making them central nodes for 3-stars. Let's now find the leaves for each 3-star with 5 and 6 as the central nodes.

For node 5:
- Leaves: 0, 2, 6
  - <5, (0, 2, 6)>

For node 6:
- Leaves: 0, 2, 5, 7, 8
  - <6, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
