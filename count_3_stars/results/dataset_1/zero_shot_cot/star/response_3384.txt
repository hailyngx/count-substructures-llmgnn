Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star configuration. 

Let's start by listing all possible 3-stars with the given nodes:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[9]
