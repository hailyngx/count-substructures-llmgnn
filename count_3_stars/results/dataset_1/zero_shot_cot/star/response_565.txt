Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

- Center node: 0, Leaves: 7, 9
- Center node: 1, Leaves: 3
- Center node: 2, Leaves: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Center node: 3, Leaves: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Center node: 4, Leaves: 2, 9
- Center node: 6, Leaves: 3, 5
- Center node: 7, Leaves: 0, 2, 8
- Center node: 9, Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 4

Therefore, there are a total of <0, (7, 9)> <1, 3> <2, (3, 4, 7, 9)> <3, (1, 2, 6, 9)> <4, 2> <6, (3, 5)> <7, (0, 2, 8)> <9, (0, 2, 3, 4)>.

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph, as shown above.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
