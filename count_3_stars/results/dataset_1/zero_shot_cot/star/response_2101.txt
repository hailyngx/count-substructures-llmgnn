Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0:
   - <0, (3, 5, 9)>
  
2. Node 1:
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (2, 8, 9)>
   
3. Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
  
4. Node 3:
   - <3, (0, 1, 2)>
  
5. Node 4:
   - <4, (1, 7, 8)>
  
6. Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 9)>
   
7. Node 9:
   - <9, (0, 3, 5)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 8)>
   - <9, (6, 8, 5)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
