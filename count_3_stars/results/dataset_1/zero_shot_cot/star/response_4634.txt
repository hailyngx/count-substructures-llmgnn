Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, where each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with such properties are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 1:
- <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
Therefore, there are 4 3-stars centered at Node 1.

2. For Node 5:
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
Therefore, there is 1 3-star centered at Node 5.

3. For Node 7:
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 8)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
Therefore, there are 3 3-stars centered at Node 7.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
