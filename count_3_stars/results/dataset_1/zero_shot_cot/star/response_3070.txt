Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections:
Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 1: 0, 8
Node 2: 0, 6
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 7, 9
Node 5: 0, 3
Node 6: 0, 2, 7
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 0, 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
3. <0, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <0, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <4, (6, 7, 9)>  

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
