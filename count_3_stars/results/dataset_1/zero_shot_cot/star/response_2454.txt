Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

First, let's list all the nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 2, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
