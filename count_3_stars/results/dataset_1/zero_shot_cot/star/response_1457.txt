Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes that are directly connected to node 0.
    - Nodes directly connected to node 0: 6, 7, 8

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars centered at node 0.
    - Based on the connections, the possible 3-stars centered at node 0 are: (0, 6, 7, 8).

Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 7, 8)>
