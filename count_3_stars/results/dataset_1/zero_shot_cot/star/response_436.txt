Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
