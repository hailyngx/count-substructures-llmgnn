Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would be the potential centers of 3-stars. 
Here are the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 9.
- Nodes 8, 9 don't have exactly three connections.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes:
- Node 0: (1, 2, 5), (1, 5, 6), (2, 5, 0), (5, 0, 6) <4 unique 3-stars>
- Node 3: (4, 5, 8), (5, 3, 8) <2 unique 3-stars>
- Node 4: (3, 5, 6), (5, 6, 0), (6, 0, 1), (6, 5, 4) <4 unique 3-stars>
- Node 7: (2, 5, 9), (5, 7, 9) <2 unique 3-stars>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
