Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (7, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 2)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 0, -)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>

There are total [8] 3-stars in the graph.
