Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars below:
<0, (1, 9, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 9)>
<8, (4, 9, 9)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
