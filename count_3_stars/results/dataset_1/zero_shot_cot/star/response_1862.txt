Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's consider each node as the center in turn and find the corresponding 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
   <0, (1, 5, 9)>

2. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 9.
   <1, (0, 5, 9)>
   
3. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
   (No 3-star with node 2 as center)

4. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
   (No 3-star with node 3 as center)

5. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to node 2.
   (No 3-star with node 4 as center)

6. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
   (No 3-star with node 5 as center)

7. Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
   (No 3-star with node 9 as center)

Count of 3-stars: [2]

Therefore, the output is: [2]
