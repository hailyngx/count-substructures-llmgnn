Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given graph G with 10 nodes and 32 edges. 
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find the instances where one node is connected to exactly three others in a star-like pattern.

Count of 3-stars: [3]

<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
