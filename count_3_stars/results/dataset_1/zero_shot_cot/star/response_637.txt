Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has two neighbors: 3 and 4, forming two possible 3-stars:
   a. <0, (3, 4)>
   
2. Node 1 has two neighbors: 2 and 6, forming two possible 3-stars:
   b. <1, (2, 6)>
   
3. Node 2 has four neighbors: 1, 5, 6, and 8, forming four possible 3-stars:
   c. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
   d. <2, (1, 6, 8)>
   e. <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   f. <2, (1, 5, 8)>
   
4. Node 3 has two neighbors: 0 and 9, forming two possible 3-stars:
   g. <3, (0, 9)>
   
5. Node 4 has two neighbors: 0 and 6, forming two possible 3-stars:
   h. <4, (0, 6)>
   
6. Node 5 has two neighbors: 2 and 7, forming two possible 3-stars:
   i. <5, (2, 7)>
   
7. Node 6 has five neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7, and 9, forming five possible 3-stars:
   j. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
   k. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
   l. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
   m. <6, (1, 2, 9)>
   n. <6, (4, 7, 9)>
   
8. Node 7 has two neighbors: 5 and 6, forming two possible 3-stars:
   o. <7, (5, 6)>
   
9. Node 8 has one neighbor: 2, but it doesn't form a 3-star.
   
10. Node 9 has two neighbors: 3 and 6, forming two possible 3-stars:
   p. <9, (3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].  
   
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4)>, <1, (2, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 9)>, <4, (0, 6)>, <5, (2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (5, 6)>, <9, (3, 6)>
