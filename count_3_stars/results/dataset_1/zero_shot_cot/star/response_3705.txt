Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
