Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's find the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
1. <0, (4, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
3. <2, (8, 9, -)>
4. <3, (4, 6, -)>

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].
