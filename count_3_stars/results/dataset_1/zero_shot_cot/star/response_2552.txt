Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and the center node 0: <0, (2, 5)>
- Node 2 forms two 3-stars:
    - <2, (0, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, and the center node 3: <3, (2, 7)>
- Node 9 forms three 3-stars:
    - <9, (4, 6, 7)>
    - <9, (6, 7, 4)>
    - <9, (7, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
