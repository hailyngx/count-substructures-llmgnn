Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the center nodes by looking for nodes with exactly 3 edges:
   - Node 2 and Node 8 are both centers.

2. For each center node, list the nodes directly connected to it:
   - Center Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9)
   - Center Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9)

3. List all the unique 3-stars:
   - <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (4, 7, 9)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 7)>
   - <8, (3, 4, 9)>
   - <8, (3, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
