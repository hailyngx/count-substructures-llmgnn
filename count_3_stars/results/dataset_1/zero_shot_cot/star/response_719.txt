Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected directly to the central node, which is the node that has exactly three edges connected to it. In this case, the central node is node 0 since it has edges connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.

Next, we need to find the nodes that are directly connected to the central node's neighbors, excluding the central node itself. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
