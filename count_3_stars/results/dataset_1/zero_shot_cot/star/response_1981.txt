Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 9)
- From node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 4, 9)
- From node 2: (2, 5, 7), (2, 5, 9)
- From node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 4, 5)
- From node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 1, 3)
- From node 5: (5, 0, 2), (5, 2, 3)
- From node 6: (6, 3, 5), (6, 5, 7)
- From node 7: (7, 2, 6)
- From node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 1, 2)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1,(3, 4, 9)>, <2,(5, 7, 9)>, <3,(1, 4, 5)>, <4,(0, 1, 3)>, <5,(0, 2, 3)>, <6,(3, 5, 7)>, <7,(2, 6)>, <9,(0, 1, 2)>
