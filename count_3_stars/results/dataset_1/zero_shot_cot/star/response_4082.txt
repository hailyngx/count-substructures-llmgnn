Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the central node and the nodes connected to it. 

The central node of each 3-star must have exactly three neighbors since a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. So, we need to find nodes that have three neighbors, which would make them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the following nodes have three neighbors:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.

Now, let's list all unique 3-stars in the graph with the central nodes and their connected nodes:

<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
