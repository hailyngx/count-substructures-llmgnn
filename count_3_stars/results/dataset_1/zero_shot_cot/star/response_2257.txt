Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their respective leaves.

Let's start by listing the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:
- Central Node: 0, Adjacent Nodes: 3
- Central Node: 1, Adjacent Nodes: 4, 7, 9
- Central Node: 2, Adjacent Nodes: 6, 8
- Central Node: 3, Adjacent Nodes: 0, 7, 8
- Central Node: 4, Adjacent Nodes: 1, 6
- Central Node: 5, Adjacent Nodes: 9
- Central Node: 6, Adjacent Nodes: 2, 4
- Central Node: 7, Adjacent Nodes: 1, 3, 8
- Central Node: 8, Adjacent Nodes: 2, 3, 7
- Central Node: 9, Adjacent Nodes: 1, 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by considering each central node with its adjacent nodes:
<0, (3)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 6)>
<5, (9)>
<6, (2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 5)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 10. So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
