Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes in the graph and their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- By observing the connections, we can see that node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 7. <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 also forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, and 8. <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, and 7. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 6. <7, (1, 3, 6)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The unique 3-stars are: <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, and <7, (1, 3, 6)>.
