Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 4, and 6.
    - This forms a 3-star: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
    
2. Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 4, and 5.
    - This forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 5)>

3. Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 2, and 7.
    - This forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 7)>

4. Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 2, and 9.
    - This forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 9)>

5. Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 1, and 5.
    - This forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>.
