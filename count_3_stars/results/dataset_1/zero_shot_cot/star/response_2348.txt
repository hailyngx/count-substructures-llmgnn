Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
