Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 8, 1)>
2. <1, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
5. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
6. <6, (1, 3, 9)>
7. <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
