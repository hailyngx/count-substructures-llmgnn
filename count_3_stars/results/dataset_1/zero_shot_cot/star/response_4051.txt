Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8. <1, (4, 7, 8)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7. <2, (3, 6, 7)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7. <6, (2, 3, 7)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6. <7, (1, 3, 6)>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7. <8, (1, 3, 7)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, thus the number of 3-stars is [6].
