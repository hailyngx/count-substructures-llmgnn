Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Given the edges:
(0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8)

Let's list all the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (3, 9, 1)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
