Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7: <1, (0, 3, 7)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <5, (0, 2, 3)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7: <6, (0, 4, 7)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
