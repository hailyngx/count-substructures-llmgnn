Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 9: <3, (0, 7, 9)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <4, (0, 1, 5)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4: <6, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
