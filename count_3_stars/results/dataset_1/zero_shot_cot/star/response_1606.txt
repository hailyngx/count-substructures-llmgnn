Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes would be the potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with degree 3 are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4)

Now, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

So, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
