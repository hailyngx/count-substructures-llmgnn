Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given graph:
- 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 24 edges: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 5)

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph. 

First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. For node 0: <0, (4, 6)>
2. For node 1: <1, (2, 7, 8)>
3. For node 2: <2, (1, 4, 8)>
4. For node 4: <4, (0, 2, 7)>
5. For node 6: <6, (0, 5, 7)>
6. For node 7: <7, (1, 4, 6)>
7. For node 8: <8, (1, 2)>
8. For node 9: No 3-star as it has only one edge.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [7] 
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (4, 6)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 2)>
