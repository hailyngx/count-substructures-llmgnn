Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph.

Let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves:
- Node 1 has leaves: 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 has leaves: 1, 3
- Node 5 has leaves: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8 has leaves: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9 has leaves: 0, 2, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars. 

[The number of 3-stars is: **4**]

<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
