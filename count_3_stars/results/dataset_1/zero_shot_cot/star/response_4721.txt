Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 9) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form a 3-star. 

Let's first identify the center nodes and their corresponding leaves:
- Center node 0: Leaves {1, 9}
- Center node 1: Leaves {0, 7}
- Center node 2: Leaves {7, 9}
- Center node 5: No 3-star as it has only one connection.
- Center node 6: Leaves {5, 8}
- Center node 7: Leaves {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Center node 8: Leaves {6, 7}
- Center node 9: Leaves {0, 2, 7}

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 9)>
<1, (0, 7)>
<2, (7, 9)>
<6, (5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 9)>
<7, (2, 8)>
<8, (6, 7)>
<9, (0, 2)>
<9, (7, 0)>
<9, (7, 2)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars, we get:
[10]
