Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. 

[6]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
