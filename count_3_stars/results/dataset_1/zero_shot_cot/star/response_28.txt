Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step.

The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3, and the adjacent nodes must have degree 1.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
