Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3, 5), (0, 5, 6) [<0, (3, 5, 6)>]
2. Node 2: (2, 6, 4) [<2, (6, 4, 5)>]
3. Node 3: (3, 0, 8) [<3, (0, 8, 6)>]
4. Node 4: (4, 5, 6) [<4, (5, 6, 0)>]
5. Node 5: (5, 0, 4), (5, 4, 6), (5, 7, 9) [<5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 0)>, <5, (7, 9, 0)>]
6. Node 6: (6, 0, 2), (6, 2, 4), (6, 4, 8) [<6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>]
7. Node 8: (8, 3, 6) [<8, (3, 6, 0)>]
8. Node 9: (9, 5, 7) [<9, (5, 7, 0)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
