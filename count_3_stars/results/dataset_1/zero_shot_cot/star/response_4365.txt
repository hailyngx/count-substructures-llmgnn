Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- Nodes with degree:
    - Node 0: 3
    - Node 1: 1
    - Node 2: 2
    - Node 3: 2
    - Node 4: 3
    - Node 5: 5
    - Node 6: 5
    - Node 7: 4
    - Node 8: 3
    - Node 9: 2

Based on the degrees of the nodes, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [5].
