Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, 1, and 2 since they have a degree of 5, 4, and 3 respectively.

For node 0:
- Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 9

For node 1:
- Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9

For node 2:
- Nodes connected to node 2: 1, 5, 8, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 3-stars with the following combinations:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
