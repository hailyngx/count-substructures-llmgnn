Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The given graph can be visualized as follows:
```
   0 - 7 - 6
   |       |
   9       1
           | \
           5  4
              |
              8
```

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 0 has 2 edges: (0, 7) and (0, 9). It can form 1 3-star: <0, (7, 9)>
2. Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 4), (1, 5), and (1, 6). It can form 0 3-stars because it requires at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.
3. Node 4 has 4 edges: (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 8), and (4, 5). It can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 8)>
4. Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7), and (5, 9). It can form 3 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>
5. Node 6 has 2 edges: (6, 1), and (6, 7). It can form 1 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 0)>
6. Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 6), and (7, 5). It can form 1 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 5)>
7. Node 8 has 1 edge: (8, 4). It can form 0 3-stars because it requires at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.
8. Node 9 has 2 edges: (9, 0) and (9, 5). It can form 1 3-star: <9, (0, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <7, (0, 6, 5)>.
