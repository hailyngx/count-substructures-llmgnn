Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1: nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 are directly connected to node 1.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1, there are 5 choices for the connected node, resulting in 5 possible 3-stars.
- For each of the nodes connected to node 1 (nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9), we can form a 3-star. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5 (from node 1) + 5 (from node 2) + 5 (from node 4) + 5 (from node 5) + 5 (from node 7) + 5 (from node 9) = 30.

Thus, there are 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
