Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 9)
2. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8)
3. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7)
4. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3)
5. Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 8)
6. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 9)
7. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3)
8. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 5)
9. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 6)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars formed by the nodes.

There are 9 possible 3-stars in this graph.
[9]

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
