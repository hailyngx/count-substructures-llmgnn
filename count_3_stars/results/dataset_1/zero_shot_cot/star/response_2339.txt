Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 4, 8)
2. Central node 2: (2, 3, 5)
3. Central node 6: (6, 1, 4)
4. Central node 6: (6, 4, 8)
5. Central node 6: (6, 4, 9)
6. Central node 8: (8, 0, 4)
7. Central node 8: (8, 6, 7)
8. Central node 8: (8, 4, 7)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].  
<0, (4, 8)>  
<2, (3, 5)>  
<6, (1, 4)>  
<6, (4, 8)>  
<6, (4, 9)>  
<8, (0, 4)>  
<8, (6, 7)>  
<8, (4, 7)>
