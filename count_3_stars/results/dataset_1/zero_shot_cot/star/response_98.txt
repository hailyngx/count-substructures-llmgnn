Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step. 

First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors, as these will form the 3-stars. 

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, and 8.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 7.
3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
4. Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 0.
5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, and 8.
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 1 and 2.
7. Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 7.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.
9. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, and 4.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [7] 3-stars.
