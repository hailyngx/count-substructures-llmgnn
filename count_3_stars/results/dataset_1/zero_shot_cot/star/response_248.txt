Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. We will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph with their central node and leaf nodes:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, -)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 9, -)>
<9, (1, 8, -)>

Thus, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
