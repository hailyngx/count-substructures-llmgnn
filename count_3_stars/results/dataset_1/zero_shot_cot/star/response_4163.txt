Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can start by examining all nodes in the graph:

Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 8), (0, 9) - Forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 8)>
Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7) - Forms no 3-stars
Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 8) - Forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 4) - Forms no 3-stars
Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6) - Forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 8) - Forms a 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 8)>
Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5) - Forms no 3-stars
Node 7: (7, 1) - Forms no 3-stars
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 9) - Forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 5)>
Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 8) - Forms no 3-stars

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
