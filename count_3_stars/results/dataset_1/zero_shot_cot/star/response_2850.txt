Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.
