Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the central node and nodes 6, 7, and 8 as the leaves. <1, (6, 7, 8)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the central node and nodes 1, 2, and 3 as the leaves. <4, (1, 2, 3)>
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 9. This forms a 3-star with node 7 as the central node and nodes 1, 5, and 6 as the leaves. <7, (1, 5, 6)>
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 1, 5, and 6 as the leaves. <8, (1, 5, 6)>
5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the central node and nodes 1, 4, and 7 as the leaves. <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
