Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph and then count them.

There are three possible steps to form a 3-star:
1. Select a central node.
2. Attach three leaves to the central node.
3. Make sure the leaves are not directly connected to each other.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 9)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
