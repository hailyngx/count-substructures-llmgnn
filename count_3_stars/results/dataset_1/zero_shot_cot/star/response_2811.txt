Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 in the given graph.

The nodes connected to node 0 are 5 and 9.

Therefore, there are two potential 3-stars centered at node 0. Let's list them:

1. <0, (5, 9)>
2. <0, (9, 5)>

Similarly, we can identify the 3-stars centered at nodes 1, 2, and 3:

1. <1, (3, 5)>
2. <1, (5, 3)>
3. <2, (6, 9)>
4. <2, (9, 6)>
5. <3, (1, 4)>
6. <3, (4, 1)>

Now, we have identified all the 3-stars in the given graph. Let's count them.

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [6].
