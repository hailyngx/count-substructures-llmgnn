Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes in each 3-star configuration. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the central node: Review each node in the graph and find nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

2. For each central node, identify the connected nodes: For each central node found in step 1, list the nodes that are directly connected to it. These connected nodes form the leaves of the 3-star configurations.

Let's start the process:

- Central Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7 -> <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Central Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8 -> <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Central Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5 -> <3, (2, 5)>
- Central Node 4 is not a central node as it only has 2 edges connected.
- Central Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6 -> <5, (0, 1, 3)> and <5, (0, 3, 6)> and <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- Central Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9 -> <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Central Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5 -> <7, (1, 4, 5)>
- Central Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 -> <8, (2)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-star configurations: 
<1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (2)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
