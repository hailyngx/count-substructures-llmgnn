Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 9, -)>
<9, (6, 8, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
