Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars by looking at the nodes with three outgoing edges (leaves) from a central node.

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Hence, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph.

The final answer is [5].
