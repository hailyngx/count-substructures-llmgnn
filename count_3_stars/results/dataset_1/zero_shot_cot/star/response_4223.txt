Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

The central nodes are: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9

- Central node 0: (0, 4, 7), (0, 7, 9), (0, 4, 1) [3 stars]
- Central node 1: (1, 4, 5), (1, 5, 9) [2 stars]
- Central node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 8, 9) [2 stars]
- Central node 7: (7, 0, 2), (7, 6, 2) [2 stars]
- Central node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 5, 1), (9, 8, 4) [3 stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
