Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the nodes that are connected to three other nodes. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars.

After analyzing the provided edges, we find that nodes 2, 4, and 7 are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them the centers of potential 3-stars. 

Next, we need to identify the edges that form 3-stars with these center nodes:
1. For node 2, the 3-stars are: <2, (1, 4, 6)> and <2, (4, 6, 7)>
2. For node 4, the 3-stars are: <4, (1, 2, 6)> and <4, (2, 6, 7)>
3. For node 7, the 3-star is: <7, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars in the graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars identified are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, and <7, (2, 4, 6)>.
