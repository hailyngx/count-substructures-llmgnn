Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to locate all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 6)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
