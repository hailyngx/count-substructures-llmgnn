Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
