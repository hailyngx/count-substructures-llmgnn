Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. There are 10 nodes in the graph, numbered from 0 to 9.
2. The connections between nodes are described by the given edges.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6, forming a 3-star with center at node 1: <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5, forming a 3-star with center at node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 9, forming a 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (2, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
