Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Central node: 0, Leaves: 4, 5
- Central node: 1, Leaves: 8, 9
- Central node: 2, Leaves: 8, 9
- Central node: 3, Leaves: 7
- Central node: 4, Leaves: 5, 6
- Central node: 5, Leaves: 0, 4
- Central node: 6, Leaves: 4, 8
- Central node: 7, Leaves: 3
- Central node: 8, Leaves: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Central node: 9, Leaves: 1, 2, 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 5)>, <1, (8, 9)>, <2, (8, 9)>, <3, (7)>, <4, (5, 6)>, <5, (0, 4)>, <6, (4, 8)>, <7, (3)>, <8, (1, 2, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>.
