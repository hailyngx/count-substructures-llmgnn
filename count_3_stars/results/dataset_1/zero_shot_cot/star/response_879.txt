Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
  
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>

Counting the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star pattern:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)> appears 1 time
- <2, (3, 4, 5)> appears 1 time
- <5, (0, 2, 8)> appears 1 time

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
