Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars: 

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 9, 5)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [9].
