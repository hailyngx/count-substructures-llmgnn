Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes with edges. 

Let's list down the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 3)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Since there are 7 unique 3-stars found in the graph, the final answer of the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
