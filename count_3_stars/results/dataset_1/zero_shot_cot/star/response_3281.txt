Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. <2, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7. <4, (1, 2, 7)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8. <6, (2, 5, 8)>
4. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. <8, (2, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
