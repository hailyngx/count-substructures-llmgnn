Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (1, 8, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
