Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify groups of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9. Hence, <1, (0, 2, 9)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8. Hence, <2, (1, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8, 9. Hence, <3, (4, 5, 8)> and <3, (4, 5, 9)> are 3-stars.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5. Hence, <4, (3, 5, 0)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8. Hence, <5, (0, 3, 4)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5. Hence, <8, (1, 2, 3)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7. Hence, <9, (1, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
