Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <4, (3, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (4, 7)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 7)>
7. <7, (0, 3, 5)>
8. <8, (6, 9)>
9. <9, (6, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
