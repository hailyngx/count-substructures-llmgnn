Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 2) <0, (2, 8, 1)>
2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 4) <1, (4, 8, 0)>
3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4) <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 1) <4, (1, 2, 8)>
5. Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5) <8, (0, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
