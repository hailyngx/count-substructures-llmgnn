Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star and the nodes that are connected to the center node. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 is connected to: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2 is connected to: 3
- Node 3 is connected to: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 4 is connected to: 3, 6, 7
- Node 5 is connected to: 0
- Node 6 is connected to: 0, 4
- Node 7 is connected to: 4, 9
- Node 8 is connected to: 0, 1
- Node 9 is connected to: 3, 7

2. Identify the 3-stars: 
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- <7, (4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 6 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
