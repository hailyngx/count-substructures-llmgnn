Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Step 1: Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.
    - Node 2 has edges to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
    - Node 4 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
    - Node 5 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 7.

Step 2: Count the 3-stars based on the identified nodes.
    1. For node 2:
        <2, (3, 4, 5)>
    2. For node 4:
        <4, (2, 3, 5)>
    3. For node 5:
        <5, (0, 2, 7)>

Step 3: Combine all unique 3-stars found.
    [<2, (3, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
