Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>

By counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
