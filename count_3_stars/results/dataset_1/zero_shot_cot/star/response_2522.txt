Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the nodes that form 3-stars with the center. 

Let's look at each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars. 

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (3, 6, 7)>
   - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (7, 8, 3)>

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (2, 6, 7)>

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 3, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (0, 2, 8)>

5. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 1, 8)>

6. Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 1, 8)>
   - <7, (8, 9, 0)>

7. Node 8:
   - <8, (0, 3, 6)>
   - <8, (6, 7, 0)>

8. Node 9:
   - <9, (2, 7, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
