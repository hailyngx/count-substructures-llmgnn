Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-star subgraphs. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 5
   - Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 6, 7
   - Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 5, 8
   - Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9
   - Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 6, 7

2. Count the number of 3-stars by considering each node as the center:
   - For node 0: (0, 3, 5) and (0, 5, 3) are the 3-stars centered at node 0.
   - For node 1: (1, 6, 7) and (1, 7, 6) are the 3-stars centered at node 1.
   - For node 3: (3, 0, 5), (3, 5, 0), and (3, 5, 8) are the 3-stars centered at node 3.
   - For node 5: (5, 0, 3), (5, 3, 0), (5, 4, 9), and (5, 9, 4) are the 3-stars centered at node 5.
   - For node 8: (8, 3, 6), (8, 6, 3), (8, 6, 7), and (8, 7, 6) are the 3-stars centered at node 8.

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (3, 5, 0)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (6, 7, 1)>
   - <3, (0, 5, 3)>
   - <5, (4, 9, 5)>
   - <8, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
