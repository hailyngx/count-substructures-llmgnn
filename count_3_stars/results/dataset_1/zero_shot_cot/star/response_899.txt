Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We'll look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes and list them as 3-stars. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 4)>
2. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
3. <0, (3, 4, 5)>
4. <0, (4, 5, 7)>
5. <0, (4, 5, 9)>
6. <0, (5, 7, 9)>
7. <1, (0, 6, 2)>
8. <2, (3, 6, 9)>
9. <3, (0, 2, 4)>
10. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
11. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
12. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
13. <6, (1, 5, 2)>
14. <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
