Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
