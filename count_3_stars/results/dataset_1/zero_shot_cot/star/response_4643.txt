Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 5, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 8, 2)>
3. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
4. <9, (3, 7, 4)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
