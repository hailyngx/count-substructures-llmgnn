Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9 (forming a 3-star with node 1 as the center).
- Node 2 is connected to node 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to node 1.

Based on the connections, we have the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
