Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

The graph's nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 4.
   <0, (1, 2, 4)>

2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 4.
   <1, (0, 3, 4)>
   
3. Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 8.
   <2, (0, 5, 8)>

4. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 6.
   <3, (1, 5, 6)>

5. Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 6.
   <4, (0, 1, 6)>

6. Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 3, 8.
   <5, (2, 3, 8)>

7. Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
   <6, (1, 3, 4)>

8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3.
   <8, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
