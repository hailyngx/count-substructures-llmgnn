Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: Calculate the maximum number of 3-stars possible in the given graph.  
    - Since each 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes, we will consider each node as the central node and count how many 3-stars can be formed around it.  
    - Since the graph has 10 nodes, we have 10 options for the central node.  
    - For each central node, we need to choose 3 nodes out of the remaining 9 nodes to form a 3-star.  
    - Therefore, the maximum possible number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 * (9 choose 3) = 10 * 84 = 840.  

Step 2: Count the actual number of 3-stars in the given graph.  
    - We will examine each node as a potential central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.  
    - Count the number of valid 3-stars.
