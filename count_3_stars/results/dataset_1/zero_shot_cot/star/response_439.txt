Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's determine which nodes fit this criteria. 

Looking at the provided edge list, we find that the central node will be the node with the highest degree, i.e., the node with the most edges connected to it. In this case, node 0 has the highest degree with 4 edges, making it the central node of the 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the leaves of each 3-star. A leaf node is any node connected to the center (node 0) by an edge. By examining the edges in the list, we can find the three leaves connected to the central node.

The 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, -)>
<3, (0, 7, -)>
<4, (1, 9, -)>
<5, (-, 8, -)>
<6, (-, 9, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the answer in brackets is [10].
