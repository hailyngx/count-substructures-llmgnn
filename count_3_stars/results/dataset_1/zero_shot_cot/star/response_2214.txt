Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected to three other nodes.

The central nodes in this graph are nodes 2, 4, 5, and 7. Now, we will list all the 3-stars with these central nodes:

<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
