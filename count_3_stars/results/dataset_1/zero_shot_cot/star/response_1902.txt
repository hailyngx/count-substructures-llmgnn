Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 2)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
