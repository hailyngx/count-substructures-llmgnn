Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 1: (5, 0, 8)
- Node 2: (3, 7, 8)
- Node 3: (2, 4, 7)
- Node 4: (0, 3, 8)
- Node 5: (0, 1, 8)
- Node 6: (5, 9, 6)
- Node 7: (0, 2, 3)
- Node 8: (0, 1, 4)
- Node 9: (5, 8, 6)

Therefore, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 0, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 6)>
