Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (2, 6, 9)>
3. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
4. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
5. <5, (3, 6, 9)>
6. <6, (0, 1, 3)>
7. <7, (4, 5, 6)>
8. <8, (4, 6, 9)>
9. <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
