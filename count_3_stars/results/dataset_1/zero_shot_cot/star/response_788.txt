Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star. 
- For each node, determine if it has exactly 3 neighbors. 
- If it does, check if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 0 has the neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9. Since it has 5 neighbors, it is not a central node of any 3-star.

2. Node 1 has the neighbors: 0, 2, 3. It forms a 3-star: *<1, (0, 2, 3)>*.

3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a central node of any 3-star.

4. Node 3 has the neighbors: 1, 5. It's not a central node of any 3-star.

5. Node 4 has the neighbors: 0, 7, 9. It's not a central node of any 3-star.

6. Node 5 has the neighbors: 3, 8, 9. It forms two 3-stars: *<5, (3, 8, 9)>* and *<5, (8, 9, 0)>*.

7. Node 6 has 1 neighbor, so it's not a central node of any 3-star.

8. Node 7 has the neighbors: 4, 8. It's not a central node of any 3-star.

9. Node 8 has the neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7. Since it has 4 neighbors, it is not a central node of any 3-star.

10. Node 9 has the neighbors: 0, 4, 5. It's not a central node of any 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
- <*1, (0, 2, 3)*>
- <*5, (3, 8, 9)*>
- <*5, (8, 9, 0)*>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [3]
