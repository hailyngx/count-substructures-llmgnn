Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.

We now search for 3-star patterns by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-star patterns in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (2, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (7, 8, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
