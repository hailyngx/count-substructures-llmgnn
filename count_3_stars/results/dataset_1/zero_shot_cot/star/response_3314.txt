Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
3. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
4. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <7, (4, 6, 8)>
6. <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find a total of [6].
