Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of our 3-stars. In this case, the nodes that fit this criteria are: 1, 3, 7, and 8.

Next, we will find the leaves connected to each central node.

For node 1:
- Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 7

For node 3:
- Leaves: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9

For node 7:
- Leaves: 1, 3, 6, 8

For node 8:
- Leaves: 2, 5, 7, 9

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (3, 2, 7)>
- <1, (7, 0, 2)>
- <1, (7, 3, 2)>
- <3, (1, 5, 6)>
- <3, (9, 1, 5)>
- <3, (1, 7, 6)>
- <3, (9, 5, 1)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (8, 2, 5)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (9, 7, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
