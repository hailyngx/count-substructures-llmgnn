Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Each such node will be the center of a 3-star. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
