Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
    
    1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
    2. <0, (6, 8, 2)>
    3. <0, (8, 1, 6)>
    4. <1, (0, 8, 5)>
    5. <2, (0, 8, 5)>
    6. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
    7. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
    8. <5, (4, 6, 2)>
    9. <6, (0, 4, 8)>
    10. <8, (0, 1, 6)>
    11. <8, (2, 6, 0)>
    12. <8, (7, 9, 2)>
    13. <9, (2, 6, 8)>
    
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
