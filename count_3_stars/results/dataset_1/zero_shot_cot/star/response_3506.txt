Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's analyze each node to see if it is part of any 3-star structure. 

1. Node 0: Not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: 3-star with central node 1: <1, (4, 5, 8)>
3. Node 2: 3-star with central node 2: <2, (4, 6, 7)>
4. Node 3: Not part of any 3-star.
5. Node 4: 3-star with central node 4: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
6. Node 5: 3-star with central node 5: <5, (1, 4, 7)>
7. Node 6: Not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7: 3-star with central node 7: <7, (2, 4, 5)>
9. Node 8: Not part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: Not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>>.

Count of 3-stars: [4]
