Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list down all the possible 3-stars by considering each node as the center node one by one.

1. Starting with node 0:
   - <0, (2, 5, 7)>
   
2. Moving on to node 1:
   - <1, (5, 7, 8)>
   
3. Next, node 2:
   - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
   
4. Considering node 4:
   - <4, (7, 5, 0)>
   
5. Focusing on node 5:
   - <5, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <5, (7, 8, 9)>
   
6. Looking at node 7:
   - <7, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <7, (1, 4, 5)>
   - <7, (4, 5, 8)>
   - <7, (5, 8, 0)>
   
7. Finally, node 8:
   - <8, (1, 5, 7)>
   
In total, there are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
