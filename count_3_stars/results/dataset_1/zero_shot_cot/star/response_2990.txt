Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 does not have 3 edges connected to it, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 9). Node 1 is the center of a 3-star with nodes (7, 2, 9).
3. Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7). Node 2 is the center of a 3-star with nodes (1, 6, 7).
4. Node 3 does not have 3 edges connected to it.
5. Node 4 does not have 3 edges connected to it.
6. Node 5 does not have 3 edges connected to it.
7. Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 9). Node 6 is the center of two 3-stars with nodes (2, 3, 8) and (2, 8, 9).
8. Node 7 has 3 edges connected to it (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2). Node 7 is the center of a 3-star with nodes (0, 1, 2).
9. Node 8 does not have 3 edges connected to it.
10. Node 9 does not have 3 edges connected to it.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <1, (7, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, and <6, (2, 8, 9)>.
