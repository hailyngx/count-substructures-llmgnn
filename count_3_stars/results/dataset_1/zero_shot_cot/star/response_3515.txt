Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

The center of a 3-star can be any node in the graph. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on each node being the center and then sum them up to get the total count.

Starting from each node, we will look at all its neighbors and check for triangles formed by those neighbors. The number of such triangles is equal to the number of 3-stars with that node as the center.

Calculating for each potential center node:
- For node 0: 
    - Neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
    - Triangles: (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 8)
    - Total 3-stars: 2
- For node 1:
    - Neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
    - Triangles: (0, 3, 4), (3, 4, 6)
    - Total 3-stars: 2
- For node 2:
    - Neighbors: 1, 6
    - No 3-stars
- For node 3:
    - Neighbors: 0, 1, 5
    - No 3-stars
- For node 4:
    - Neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7
    - Triangle: (0, 1, 5)
    - Total 3-stars: 1
- For node 5:
    - Neighbors: 3, 4, 8
    - No 3-stars
- For node 6:
    - Neighbors: 1, 2, 4
    - No 3-stars
- For node 7:
    - Neighbors: 0, 4
    - No 3-stars
- For node 8:
    - Neighbors: 0, 5, 9
    - No 3-stars
- For node 9:
    - Neighbors: 1, 8
    - No 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, and <4, (0, 1, 5)>.
