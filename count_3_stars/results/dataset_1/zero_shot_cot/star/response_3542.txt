Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are the centers of the 3-stars. These nodes are: 1, 5, 6, 8.

Next, let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the number of 3-stars found, we get a total of [4].
