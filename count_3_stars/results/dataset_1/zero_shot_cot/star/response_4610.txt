Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the number of nodes connected to each node by an edge. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. So, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

2. Let's start by listing the nodes with three edges connected to them:
   - Node 0 has edges to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
   - Node 2 has edges to nodes 1, 3, and 5.
   - Node 3 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
   - Node 6 has edges to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
   - Node 7 has edges to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
   - Node 9 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 6.

3. Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
   - <0, (3, 6, 8)>
   - <2, (1, 3, 5)>
   - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <6, (0, 3, 9)>
   - <7, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <9, (2, 3, 6)>

4. Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
