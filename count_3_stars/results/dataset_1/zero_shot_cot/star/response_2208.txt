Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0, node 2, and node 3 respectively since these nodes can potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 7, and 8. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 8, and 9. <2, (5, 8, 9)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 7. <3, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>.
