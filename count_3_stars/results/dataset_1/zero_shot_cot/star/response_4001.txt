Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with 3 edges connected to them.
  
Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 6
- Node 7

Step 2: For each of the nodes identified in step 1, determine the unique 3-stars they are part of.

- Node 0:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 4)>

- Node 1:
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (6, 7, 4)>
<1, (7, 4, 9)>

- Node 6:
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 0)>

- Node 7:
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 0)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

[16]

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
