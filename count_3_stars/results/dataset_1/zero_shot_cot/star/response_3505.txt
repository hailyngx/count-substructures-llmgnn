Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (2, 8, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 3, 7)>
3. <3, (2, 5, -)>
4. <4, (9, -, -)>
5. <5, (3, 6, 7)>
6. <6, (5, 7, 9)>
7. <7, (2, 5, 6)>
8. <8, (1, 5, -)>
9. <9, (1, 4, 5)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
