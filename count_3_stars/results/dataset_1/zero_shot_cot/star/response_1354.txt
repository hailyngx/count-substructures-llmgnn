Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 0, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find 11 in total, which are as follows: 
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (1, 0, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
