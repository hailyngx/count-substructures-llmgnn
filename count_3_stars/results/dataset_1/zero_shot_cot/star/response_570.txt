Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes connected to them.

Let's start by listing the possible 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 0)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
[4]
