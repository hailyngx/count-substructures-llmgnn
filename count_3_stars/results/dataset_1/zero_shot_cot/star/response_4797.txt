Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 9, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 5, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 3, 3)>
<7, (5, 5, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 0, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
