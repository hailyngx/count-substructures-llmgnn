Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:
- 10 nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- 34 edges

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph and count them.

1. For each node, check its neighbors and form potential 3-star patterns.
2. Verify if the potential 3-star patterns meet the definition of a 3-star.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<6, (8, 9, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
