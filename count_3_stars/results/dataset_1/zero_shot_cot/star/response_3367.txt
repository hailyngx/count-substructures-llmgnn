Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, where each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify all possible combinations that meet this criteria.

Given the edges provided, we can start by looking at each node in the graph to see if it serves as the center of a 3-star. We will consider all edges incident on each node and check if there are exactly three of such edges.

Let's start with the given graph and identify the 3-stars:

```
Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6) -> <0, (1, 4, 5)>
Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 5) -> No 3-star
Node 2: (2, 4) -> No 3-star
Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9) -> <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>
Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 4) -> No 3-star
Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 9) -> <6, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 6) -> No 3-star
Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 6) -> No 3-star
```

The 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>
