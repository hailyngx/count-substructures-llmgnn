Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph.

1. 3-star with node 0 as the center: (0, 1, 3, 5)
2. 3-star with node 1 as the center: (1, 0, 3, 5), (1, 3, 8, 0)
3. 3-star with node 2 as the center: (2, 3, 4, 6), (2, 3, 6, 7), (2, 4, 6, 7), (2, 4, 6, 8), (2, 4, 7, 8), (2, 6, 7, 8)
4. 3-star with node 5 as the center: (5, 0, 1, 6)
5. 3-star with node 6 as the center: (6, 2, 3, 5)
6. 3-star with node 8 as the center: (8, 1, 2, 4), (8, 1, 2, 9), (8, 2, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (3, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>.
