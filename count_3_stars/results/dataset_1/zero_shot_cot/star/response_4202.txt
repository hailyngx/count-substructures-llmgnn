Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9, forming a 3-star centered at node 0.
   - <0, (7, 8, 9)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7, but this does not form a 3-star because node 1 is only connected to 2 other nodes.
   
3. Node 2 is connected to node 8, but this also does not form a 3-star for the same reason.

4. Node 3 is connected to node 1, but this does not form a 3-star for the same reason.

5. Node 4 is connected to node 6, forming an edge but not a 3-star.

6. Node 5 is connected to node 9, but this does not form a 3-star for the same reason.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9, but this does not form a 3-star as it is missing a connection to a third node.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 1, but this does not form a 3-star as it is missing a connection to a third node.

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 2, but this does not form a 3-star as it is missing a connection to a third node.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6, forming a 3-star centered at node 9.
    - <9, (0, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<0, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>].
