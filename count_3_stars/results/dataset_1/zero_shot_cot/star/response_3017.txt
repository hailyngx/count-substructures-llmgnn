Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6. <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6. <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 0, 6, and 7, and another with nodes 2, 8, and 9. <4, (0, 6, 7)> and <4, (2, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
