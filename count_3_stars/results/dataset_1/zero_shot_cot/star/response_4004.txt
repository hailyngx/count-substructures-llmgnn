Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, -)>
<2, (0, 7, -)>
<3, (1, 6, -)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 7, -)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
