Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

The 3-stars can only be formed with a central node and three leaves. So, for each node in the graph, we will check how many 3-star configurations it is a part of.

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 9)
2. Node 2: (2, 6, 7), (2, 7, 4), (2, 9, 3), (2, 9, 5)
3. Node 3: (3, 9, 2)
4. Node 4: (4, 5, 7)
5. Node 5: (5, 0, 4)
6. Node 6: (6, 2, 7)
7. Node 7: (7, 2, 4)
8. Node 8: (8, 6, 9)
9. Node 9: (9, 0, 5), (9, 2, 3), (9, 2, 5), (9, 5, 4), (9, 8, 6)

Count of 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (5, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 4)>
<2, (7, 4, 5)>
<2, (9, 3, 5)>
<3, (9, 2, 5)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 7, 4)>
<9, (0, 5, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (2, 5, 3)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
