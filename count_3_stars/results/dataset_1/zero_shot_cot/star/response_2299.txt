Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 0)>
5. <4, (2)>
6. <5, (1, 9)>
7. <6, (1, 8, 9)>
8. <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
