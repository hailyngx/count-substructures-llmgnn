Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to node 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to node 8.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars by observing the connections and configurations.

<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
