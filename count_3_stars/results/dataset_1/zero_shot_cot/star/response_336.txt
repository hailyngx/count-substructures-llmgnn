Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. One way to approach this is to identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, indicating that they are the centers of 3-stars.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars and count them:
- <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (7, 9, -)>
- <4, (1, 8, -)>
- <5, (2, 9, -)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <7, (3, 6, -)>
- <8, (4, -,-)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
