Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 0
- Node 5 is connected to node 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8

Now let's count the number of 3-stars (i.e., stars with 3 leaves) in this graph:
- 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (0, 8, 9)>
- 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
