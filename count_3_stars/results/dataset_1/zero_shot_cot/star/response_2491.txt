Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with three edges connected:
   - Node 0 has edges with nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - Node 1 has edges with nodes 3, 5, and 6.
   - Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
   - Node 6 has edges with nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7.
   - Node 7 has edges with nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6.
   - Node 9 has edges with nodes 0, 3, and 4.

2. Combine the above information to form 3-stars:
   - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <0, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 6)>
   - <3, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <3, (6, 7, 9)>
   - <6, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (0, 3, 7)>
   - <7, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <9, (0, 3, 4)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
   
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
