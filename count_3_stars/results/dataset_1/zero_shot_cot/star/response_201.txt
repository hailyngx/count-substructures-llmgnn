Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center and nodes 2 and 7 as leaves.
<0, (2, 7)>

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7. However, the connection to 0 and 7 are already counted. So, looking at the remaining connections 2-5 and 2-6, we can form two additional 3-stars:
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (5, 7)>

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4. This forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center and nodes 1 and 4 as leaves.
<5, (1, 4)>

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center and nodes 3 and 9 as leaves.
<6, (2, 3, 9)>

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 9. This forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center and nodes 0 and 9 as leaves.
<7, (0, 9)>

6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7. However, the connection to 7 is already counted. So, looking at the remaining connection 9-6, we can form one additional 3-star:
<9, (6, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<0, (2, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 9)>
