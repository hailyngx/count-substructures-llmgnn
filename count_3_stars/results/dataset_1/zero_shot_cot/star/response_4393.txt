Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we can search for all nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 
Let's list all nodes and their neighbors to make it easier to identify the 3-stars. 

- Node 0: neighbors {4, 9}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: neighbors {1}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 7: neighbors {5}
- Node 8: neighbors {2}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 1}

From the above information, the 3-stars in the given graph can be found as follows:
- <0, (4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, and <2, (4, 5, 8)>.
