Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Firstly, let's identify the central nodes with exactly 3 outgoing edges since each 3-star must have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. The central nodes are: 0, 4, 8.

2. For each of the central nodes, let's find the connected leaves:
   - For central node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9)
   - For central node 4: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9)
   - For central node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 9)

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (1, 3, 5)> 
   - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
   - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
