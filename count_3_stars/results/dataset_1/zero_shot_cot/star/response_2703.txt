Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
