Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 6) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8)

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. (1, 6, 7, 9)
2. (6, 1, 3, 5)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
