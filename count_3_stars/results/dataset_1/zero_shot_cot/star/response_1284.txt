Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph. 

By definition, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 0, Adjacent nodes: 2, 6, 9
2. Central node: 1, Adjacent nodes: 4, 5, 6
3. Central node: 2, Adjacent nodes: 0, 3, 5
4. Central node: 4, Adjacent nodes: 1, 5, 6
5. Central node: 5, Adjacent nodes: 1, 2, 3
6. Central node: 6, Adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 4
7. Central node: 9, Adjacent nodes: 0, 1, 4

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars and list them:

<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
