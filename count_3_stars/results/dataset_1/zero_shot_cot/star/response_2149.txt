Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, -)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [9].
