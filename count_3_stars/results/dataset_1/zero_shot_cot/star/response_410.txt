Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Since we are looking for 3-stars in the graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 9.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 8.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 8.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:

<1, (4, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (5, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
