Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can determine the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9)
    <0, (2, 6, 9)>
2. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3)
    <2, (0, 1, 3)>
3. Node 3: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7)
    <3, (2, 4, 7)>
4. Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 8)
    <6, (0, 7, 8)>
5. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6)
    <7, (3, 5, 6)>
6. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 7)
    <9, (0, 6, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
