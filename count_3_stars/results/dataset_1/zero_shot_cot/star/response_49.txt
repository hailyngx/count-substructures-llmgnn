Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. We will look for nodes that have exactly three adjacent nodes and then check if they form a 3-star. 

Let's start by listing the nodes and their adjacent nodes:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (9, 2, 9)>
2. <2, (1, 4, 9)>
3. <4, (2, 5, 7)>
4. <7, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>
