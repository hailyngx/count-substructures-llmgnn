Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it. 

1. Nodes with 3 edges connected:
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6)

2. Counting the 3-stars:
- For Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- For Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 6)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 2]
