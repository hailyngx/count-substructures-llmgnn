Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes: nodes 1, 4, and 9.

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star pattern with the adjacent nodes.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars.

Let's go step by step:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
3. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7)>
<4, (1, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
