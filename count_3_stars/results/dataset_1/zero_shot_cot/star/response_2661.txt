Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 9, -)>
3. <2, (0, 3, 4)>
4. <3, (2, 6, 9)>
5. <4, (2, -, -)>
6. <5, (0, -, -)>
7. <6, (2, 3, -)>
8. <7, (9, -, -)>
9. <8, (2, -, -)>
10. <9, (0, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. The final answer is [10].
