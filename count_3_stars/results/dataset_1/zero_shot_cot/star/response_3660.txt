Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars.

Starting with the list of edges given:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.

Let's now identify the unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-star graphs.
