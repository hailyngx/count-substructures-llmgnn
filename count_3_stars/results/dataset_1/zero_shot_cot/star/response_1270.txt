Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0: No 3-star since it has only two edges.

2. Node 1: 
   <1, (0, 5, 6)>
   <1, (2, 3, 5)>
   <1, (5, 6, 7)>
   
3. Node 2:
   <2, (1, 4, 5)>
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>
   
4. Node 3: No 3-star since it has only two edges.

5. Node 4: No 3-star since it has only one edge.

6. Node 5: 
   <5, (0, 1, 2)>
   <5, (1, 2, 7)>
   <5, (6, 7, 8)>

7. Node 6:
   <6, (0, 1, 2)>
   <6, (1, 2, 7)>
   <6, (2, 3, 7)>

8. Node 7: 
   <7, (1, 2, 5)>
   <7, (1, 2, 6)>
   <7, (3, 5, 6)>

9. Node 8: No 3-star since it has no edges.

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
