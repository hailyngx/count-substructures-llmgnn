Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
To do that, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here is a list of all 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 4)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, which is [8].
