Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are central nodes with exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6)
- Node 7: (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4)

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, represented as follows:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
