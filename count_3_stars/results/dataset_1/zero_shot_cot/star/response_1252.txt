Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. In the given graph, the nodes with degree 1 are 4 and 5. Since they cannot be part of a 3-star, we will not consider them further.

2. Now, let's look at each node in the graph and identify any 3-stars:
   - Node 0: <0, (3, 8, 9)>
   - Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
   - Node 2: <2, (3, 6, 7)>
   - Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
   - Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
