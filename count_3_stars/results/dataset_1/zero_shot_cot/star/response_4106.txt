Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (8, 9, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 2)>
<8, (2, 9, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of [14].
