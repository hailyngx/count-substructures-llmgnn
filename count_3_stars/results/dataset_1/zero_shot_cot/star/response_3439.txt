Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, -)>
<4, (9, -, -)>
<5, (1, -, -)>
<6, (0, -, -)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (7, 9, -)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
