Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, we can determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 7, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 8, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 7, 8
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 7
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 8, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
