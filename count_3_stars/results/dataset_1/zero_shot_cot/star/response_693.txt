Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the leaf nodes connected to it. A 3-star graph has the center connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
