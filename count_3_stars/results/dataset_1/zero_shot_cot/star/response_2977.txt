Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go through the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 2, 3)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 5)>
5. <4, (6, 7, 9)>
6. <5, (3, 9, 0)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
8. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
9. <8, (3, 6, 0)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
