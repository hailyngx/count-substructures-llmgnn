Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to node 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to node 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
Starting from the central node 0:
- Node 0 does not form any 3-star.

Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 forms one 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 7)>.

Moving to node 2:
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star.

Moving to node 3:
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 5)> and <3, (4, 5, 7)>.

Moving to node 4:
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 7)> and <4, (3, 5, 7)>.

Moving to node 5:
- Node 5 does not form any 3-star.

Moving to node 6:
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star.

Moving to node 7:
- Node 7 forms three 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 3)>, and <7, (4, 5, 6)>.

Moving to node 8:
- Node 8 does not form any 3-star.

Moving to node 9:
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, and <7, (1, 4, 5)>.
