Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided edges in the graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, -)> (Cannot determine the third node)
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 8, -)> (Cannot determine the third node)
- <4, (0, 3, 7)>
- <5, (2, 6, -)> (Cannot determine the third node)
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 7)>
- <9, (0, 7, -)> (Cannot determine the third node)

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is the total number of unique 3-stars, which is [7].
