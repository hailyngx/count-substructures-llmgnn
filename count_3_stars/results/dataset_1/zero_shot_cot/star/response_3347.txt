Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are adjacent to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 2, 6
- Node 6: 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: (1, 7, 2) => <0, (1, 7, 2)>
- Node 1: (0, 8, 2) => <1, (0, 8, 2)>
- Node 2: (1, 5, 6) => <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: (4, 7, 9) => <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 7: (0, 2, 9) => <7, (0, 2, 9)>
