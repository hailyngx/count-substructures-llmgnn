Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the central nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 9

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (3, 9, 0)>
<3, (2, 9, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Given the unique 3-stars above, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
