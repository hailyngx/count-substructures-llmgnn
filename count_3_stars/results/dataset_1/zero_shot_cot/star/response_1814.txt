Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This can be done by looking for nodes with degree 3 and checking for any edges among their neighbors. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3:
   - Node 0 has degree 6
   - Node 1 has degree 3
   - Node 3 has degree 7
   - Node 4 has degree 4
   - Node 5 has degree 4
   - Node 6 has degree 2
   - Node 7 has degree 6
   - Node 8 has degree 4
   - Node 9 has degree 7

2. Among nodes with degree 3, identify any connections to form 3-stars:
   - Node 1: (1, 0, 3, 4)
   - Node 4: (4, 1, 0, 7)
   
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 0, 7)>
