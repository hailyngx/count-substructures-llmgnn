Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.  
Nodes that satisfy this condition are: 2, 6, 8.  

Step 2: For each of these nodes, determine the unique 3-stars centered at them.  
- For node 2, the 3-stars are:  
    - <2, (0, 4, 5)>  
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>  
    
- For node 6, the 3-star is:  
    - <6, (2, 7, 8)>  
    
- For node 8, the 3-star is:  
    - <8, (2, 3, 6)>  
    
Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
