Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
    Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6

Step 2: For each of these nodes, determine if they form a 3-star.
    - Node 1 has edges with nodes 2, 4, and 5 => <1, (2, 4, 5)>
    - Node 2 has edges with nodes 1, 5, and 6 => <2, (1, 5, 6)>
    - Node 4 has edges with nodes 1, 3, and 5 => <4, (1, 3, 5)>
    - Node 5 has edges with nodes 1, 2, and 4 => <5, (1, 2, 4)>
    - Node 6 has edges with nodes 2, 4, and 0 => <6, (2, 4, 0)>
  
Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
