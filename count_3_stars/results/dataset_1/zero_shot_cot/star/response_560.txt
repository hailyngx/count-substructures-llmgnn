Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (3, 9, 8)>
2. <3, (0, 8, 9)>
3. <6, (2, 4, 5)>
4. <8, (1, 3, 9)>
5. <9, (0, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [5].
