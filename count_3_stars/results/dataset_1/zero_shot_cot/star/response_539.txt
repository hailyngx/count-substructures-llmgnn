Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 3)>
<3, (4, 8, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 8)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (3, 9, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars in the graph gives us a total of [6].
