Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the possible 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 7, 9)>
3. <4, (0, 8, -)>
4. <7, (2, 3, -)>
5. <8, (1, 4, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
