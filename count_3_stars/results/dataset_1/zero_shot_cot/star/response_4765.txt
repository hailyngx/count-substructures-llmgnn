Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 8, 8)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 6)> 
3. Node 2: No 3-star (since it has only two neighboring nodes)
4. Node 3: No 3-star (since it has only one neighboring node)
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 2, 5)> 
6. Node 5: No 3-star (since it has only two neighboring nodes)
7. Node 6: No 3-star (since it has only three neighboring nodes but does not form a 3-star)
8. Node 7: No 3-star (since it has only one neighboring node)
9. Node 8: No 3-star (since it has four neighboring nodes but does not form any 3-star)
10. Node 9: No 3-star (since it has only two neighboring nodes)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 8, 8)> and <4, (1, 2, 5)>.
