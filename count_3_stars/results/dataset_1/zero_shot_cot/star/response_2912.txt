Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to determine the number of 3-stars it contains.

Given that a 3-star graph consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we need to identify all the nodes in the graph that could potentially be the center of a 3-star.

1. Node 0 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
2. Node 1 has edges with nodes 0, 5, 6, and 7.
3. Node 3 has edges with nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, and 9.
4. Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 3, 5, and 7.
5. Node 5 has edges with nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4.
6. Node 7 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph using the nodes listed above:

- <0, 1, 4, 9>
- <1, 0, 6, 7>
- <3, 0, 4, 7>
- <4, 0, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
