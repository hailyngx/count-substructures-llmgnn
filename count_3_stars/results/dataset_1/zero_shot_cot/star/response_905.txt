Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars with a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided in the graph, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
1. <1, (2, 7, 8)>
2. <2, (1, 7, 8)>
3. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
4. <6, (0, 2, 4)>
5. <7, (1, 2, 8)>
6. <8, (1, 2, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
