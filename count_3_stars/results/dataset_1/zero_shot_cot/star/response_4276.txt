Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center, we can start by looking at each node and identifying if they satisfy this criteria.

Looking at the given graph, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 6), (3, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 4)
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (3, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
