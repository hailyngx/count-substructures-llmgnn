Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graph structures in the given graph step by step:

First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 1: 2, 3, 6
Node 2: 0, 1, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 6
Node 5: 9
Node 6: 4, 1, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 8
Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 3, 5, 8

Now, let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars it participates in:
- For Node 0: (0, 2, 7), (0, 3, 4)
- For Node 1: (1, 2, 6), (1, 3, 8)
- For Node 2: (2, 1, 7), (2, 0, 7)
- For Node 3: (3, 0, 8), (3, 1, 8), (3, 8, 9)
- For Node 4: (4, 0, 6)
- For Node 6: (6, 1, 4), (6, 8, 7)
- For Node 8: (8, 3, 9), (8, 6, 7), (8, 7, 2)
- For Node 9: (9, 3, 5)

Unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 7, 3)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 3)>
<2, (1, 7, 0)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 1)>
<8, (2, 7, 3)>
<8, (3, 9, 6)>
<8, (7, 2, 1)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
