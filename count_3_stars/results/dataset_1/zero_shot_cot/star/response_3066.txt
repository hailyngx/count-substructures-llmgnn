Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9) -- forms two 3-stars:
    - <1, (3, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (8, 9, 3)>

2. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8) -- no 3-stars.

3. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9) -- forms one 3-star:
    - <3, (1, 8, 9)>

4. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 9) -- no 3-stars.

5. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 8) -- no 3-stars.

6. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3) -- no 3-stars.

7. Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 9) -- no 3-stars.

8. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 7) -- forms two 3-stars:
    - <8, (1, 2, 5)>
    - <8, (3, 7, 1)>

9. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 7) -- no 3-stars.

Therefore, we found a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
