Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Possible 3-stars involving node 0:
    - <0, (4, 7, 8)>
    
2. Possible 3-stars involving node 1:
    - <1, (8, 0, 7)>
    
3. Possible 3-stars involving node 2:
    - <2, (6, 7, 8)>
    
4. Possible 3-stars involving node 3:
    - <3, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 4, 9)>
    
5. Possible 3-stars involving node 4:
    - <4, (0, 3, 5)>
    
6. Possible 3-stars involving node 5:
    - <5, (3, 4, 9)>
    
7. Possible 3-stars involving node 6:
    - None
    
8. Possible 3-stars involving node 7:
    - <7, (0, 2, 8)>
    
9. Possible 3-stars involving node 8:
    - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
    - <8, (1, 2, 3)>
    
10. Possible 3-stars involving node 9:
    - None

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
