Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
