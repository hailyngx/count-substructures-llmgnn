Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges, which will form the 3-stars. 

From the given edges, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
