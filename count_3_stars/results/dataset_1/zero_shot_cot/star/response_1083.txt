Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 9, -)>
<2, (5, 7, -)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (5, 8, -)>
<7, (2, 8, -)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
