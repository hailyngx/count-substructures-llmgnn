Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0 
   Leaves: 1, 6
   <0, (1, 6)>

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 0, 4, 8, 9
   <1, (0, 4, 8)> 
   <1, (0, 9)>
   
3. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 3, 5, 6, 9
   <2, (3, 5, 6)>
   <2, (3, 9)>
   
4. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 2, 4
   <3, (2, 4)>
   
5. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 1, 3, 8
   <4, (1, 8)>
   
6. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 2, 6, 9
   <5, (2, 6)>
   <5, (2, 9)>
   
7. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 0, 2, 5, 8
   <6, (0, 2, 5)>
   <6, (0, 8)>
   
8. Central node: 9
   Leaves: 1, 2, 5, 7
   <9, (1, 2, 5)>
   <9, (1, 7)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
