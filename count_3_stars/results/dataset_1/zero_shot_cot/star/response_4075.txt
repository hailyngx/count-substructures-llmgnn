Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all of the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<1, (4, 0, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 0, 1)>
<7, (3, 2, 5)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

So, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
