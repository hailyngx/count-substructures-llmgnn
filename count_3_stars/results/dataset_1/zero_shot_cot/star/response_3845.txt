Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Upon examining the edges provided, we find the following 3-star configurations:

1. <0, (2, 6, 8)>
2. <2, (0, 3, 7)>
3. <3, (2, 5, 6)>
4. <8, (0, 4, 6)>
5. <8, (3, 4, 7)>
6. <8, (6, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
