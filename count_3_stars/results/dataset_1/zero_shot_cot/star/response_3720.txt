Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8 <1, (2, 5, 8)>
2. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5 <2, (1, 4, 5)>
3. Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9 <5, (1, 2, 9)>
4. Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9 <7, (2, 8, 9)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
