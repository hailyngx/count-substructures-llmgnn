Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 7
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars:
- From the nodes above, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
  - <0, (2, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (3, 4, 7)>
  - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <3, (1, 4, 7)> 
  - <4, (0, 1, 7)>
  - <4, (3, 6, 7)>
  - <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Therefore, the answer is [7].
