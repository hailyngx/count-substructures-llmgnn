Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that have exactly three neighbors connected by edges:
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 4 has neighbors 2, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 has neighbors 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 9 has neighbors 3, 4, and 6.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars based on these central nodes:
- For node 3: (3, 1, 2, 7)
- For node 4: (4, 2, 7, 9)
- For node 7: (7, 0, 1, 2)
- For node 9: (9, 3, 4, 6)

Therefore, there are a total of 4 3-stars in the given graph.

<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
