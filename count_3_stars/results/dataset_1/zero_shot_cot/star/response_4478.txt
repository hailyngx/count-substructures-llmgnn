Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify central nodes
    - Node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 8)
    - Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 9)
    - Node 6 has 4 edges: (6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)
    - Node 8 has 3 edges: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 6)
    - Node 9 has 3 edges: (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6)

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars for each central node
    - Node 0: 1 <0, (2, 6, 8)>
    - Node 2: 1 <2, (0, 4, 9)>
    - Node 6: 2 <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
    - Node 8: 0
    - Node 9: 1 <9, (2, 4, 6)>

Step 3: Find the total number of 3-stars in the graph
    - Total 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
