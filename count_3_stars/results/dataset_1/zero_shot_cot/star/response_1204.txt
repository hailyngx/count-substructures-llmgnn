Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (7, 9, 4)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 4)>

Now, summing up the count of unique 3-stars found gives: [10].
