Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this network, we need to identify all the instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the unique 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (0, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 8, 0)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (7)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (1)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (1, 2, 3)>
10. <9, (7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
