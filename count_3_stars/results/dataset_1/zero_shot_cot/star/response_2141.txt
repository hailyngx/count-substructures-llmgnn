Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes: (3, 4, 5, 6, 8)
   This forms one 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 5)>

2. Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: (0, 7, 9)
   This forms one 3-star: <2, (0, 7, 9)>

3. Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: (1, 5, 7)
   This forms one 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 7)>

4. Node 4 is connected to 2 other nodes: (1, 8)
   Not a 3-star.

5. Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes: (1, 3, 9)
   This forms one 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 9)>

6. Node 6 is connected to 2 other nodes: (1, 7)
   Not a 3-star.

7. Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes: (2, 3, 6, 9)
   This forms one 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 9)>

8. Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes: (1, 4, 9)
   Not a 3-star.

9. Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes: (2, 5, 7, 8)
   This forms one 3-star: <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>.
