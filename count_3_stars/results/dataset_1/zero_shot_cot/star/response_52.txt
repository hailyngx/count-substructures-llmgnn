Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 1 forms two 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)> and <1, (5, 0, 4)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 5)> and <4, (6, 7, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
