Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Central node 0: (0, 1, 9)
- Central node 1: (1, 0, 3), (1, 6, 2)
- Central node 2: (2, 4, 5), (2, 5, 9)
- Central node 3: (3, 1, 8)
- Central node 4: (4, 2, 5), (4, 9, 5)
- Central node 5: (5, 2, 4), (5, 4, 9), (5, 8, 3), (5, 7, 9)
- Central node 6: (6, 1, 2)
- Central node 8: (8, 3, 5)
- Central node 9: (9, 0, 2), (9, 2, 5), (9, 4, 5)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [12] 3-stars.
