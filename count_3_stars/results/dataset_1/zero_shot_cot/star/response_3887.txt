Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the center nodes and their adjacent nodes. 
In this graph, the center nodes are 0, 4, and 5. 
Now let's list the edges connected to each center node. 
- Center node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)
- Center node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9)
- Center node 5: (5, 0), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 9)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars. 
For center node 0, the 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 6)> and <0, (3, 5, 7)>.
For center node 4, the 3-star is <4, (3, 5, 6)>.
For center node 5, the 3-star is <5, (0, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 6)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, and <5, (0, 4, 8)>.
