Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its neighbors in each potential 3-star configuration.

From the provided list of edges, we can see the following connections:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
8. Node 8 is connected to node 6.

Based on this information, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
