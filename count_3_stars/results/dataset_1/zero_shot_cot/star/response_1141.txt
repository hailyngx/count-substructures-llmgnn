Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central Node: 0, Leaves: 1, 2, 6
2. Central Node: 1, Leaves: 0, 4, 6
3. Central Node: 2, Leaves: 0, 6
4. Central Node: 3, Leaves: 4, 5, 6
5. Central Node: 4, Leaves: 1, 3, 6
6. Central Node: 5, Leaves: 3, 8
7. Central Node: 6, Leaves: 0, 2, 3
8. Central Node: 8, Leaves: 3, 5, 6
9. Central Node: 9, Leaves: 4, 8

This gives us the following unique 3-stars: 

<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
