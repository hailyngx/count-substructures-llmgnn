Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 5, 6)>
5. <5, (2, 3, -)>
6. <6, (3, -, -)>
7. <7, (2, 8, -)>
8. <8, (0, 3, 7)>
9. <9, (1, 2, -)>

There are a total of 9 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
