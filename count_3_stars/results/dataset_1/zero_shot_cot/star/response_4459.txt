Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
