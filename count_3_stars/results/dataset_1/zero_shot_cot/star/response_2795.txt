Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-star graphs present in the given graph:

<0, (7, 9, -)>  
<1, (2, 5, -)>  
<2, (1, 5, 7)>  
<3, (5, 8, 9)>  
<4, (7, -, -)>  
<5, (1, 2, 3)>  
<6, (5, 7, 8)>  
<7, (0, 2, 4)>  
<8, (3, 6, -)>  
<9, (0, 3, 6)>  

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph:
