Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 6, 8
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 1, 5
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 6 forms 4 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 6)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 8]
