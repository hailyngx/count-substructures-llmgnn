Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, 4: <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 7: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 3: <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, 4: <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 5: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 4: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 8: <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 6: <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, 9: <8, (6, 7, 9)>
