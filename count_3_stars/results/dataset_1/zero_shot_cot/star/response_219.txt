Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-star graphs in this given graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
