Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which fits the definition of a 3-star. Let's list those out:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8.

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- There are 2 unique 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (4, 8, 9)> and <0, (4, 8, 9)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (5, 9, 1)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (0, 6, 9)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 7, 5)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
- There is 1 unique 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (1, 4, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
