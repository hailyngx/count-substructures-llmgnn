Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the central nodes and the connected nodes to each central node:
    - For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - List the unique 3-star patterns with the central node first and the connected nodes next.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
