Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

We can see that the center nodes in the graph are: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9.

For each center node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star. 

Checking for center node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 6, 8), (2, 4, 6) - 3-stars found: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
Checking for center node 3: (3, 2, 7), (3, 7, 9) - 3-stars found: <3, (2, 7, 9)>
Checking for center node 6: (6, 2, 8), (6, 5, 7), (6, 7, 8) - 3-stars found: <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>
Checking for center node 7: (7, 3, 5), (7, 5, 6), (7, 3, 9) - 3-stars found: <7, (3, 5, 6)>
Checking for center node 8: (8, 2, 6), (8, 6, 7) - 3-stars found: <8, (2, 6, 7)>
Checking for center node 9: (9, 0, 7), (9, 3, 7) - 3-stars found: <9, (0, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 3)>.
