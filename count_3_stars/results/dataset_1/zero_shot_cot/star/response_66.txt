Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list out the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 9
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (1, 5, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 1, 9)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 8)>
8. <7, (4, 8, 9)>
9. <8, (2, 6, 7)>
10. <9, (3, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
