Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star in the given graph. 
Nodes 1, 2, and 3 have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes, indicating they can be potential center nodes. 
Let's now list the 3-stars in the graph:
<Node 1, (2, 3, 6)>
<Node 2, (1, 3, 9)>
<Node 3, (1, 2, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
