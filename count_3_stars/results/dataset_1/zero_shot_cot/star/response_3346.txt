Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in our graph. A central node is a node with exactly three neighbors. 
Based on the given information, nodes 1, 5, and 9 are central nodes because each of them is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 1, the 3-star is <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- For node 5, the 3-star is <5, (7, 8, 9)>
- For node 9, the 3-star is <9, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are three unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<1, (0, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (7, 8, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 6)>.

Counting these 3-stars, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in total.
