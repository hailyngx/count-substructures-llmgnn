Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes connected by exactly three edges.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
