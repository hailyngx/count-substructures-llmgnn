Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <5, (0, 1, 6)>
2. <6, (1, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
