Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, -)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
