Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their edges:  

Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 7)  
Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8)  
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 9)  
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 9)  
Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 9)  
Node 5: (5, 4)  
Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7), (6, 8)  
Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 6), (7, 8)  
Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 7)  
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)  

Next, let's identify the 3-star configurations with a center node connected to exactly three other nodes:  
<0, (2, 7, -)>  
<1, (3, 6, 7)>  
<2, (4, 6, 9)>  
<3, (1, 8, 9)>  
<4, (2, 5, 9)>  
<6, (1, 2, 7)>  
<7, (0, 1, 6)>  
<8, (1, 3, 6)>  
<9, (2, 3, 4)>  

Therefore, there are a total of [9] unique 3-stars in this graph.
