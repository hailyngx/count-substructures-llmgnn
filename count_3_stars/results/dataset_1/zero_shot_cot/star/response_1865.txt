Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon examining the edges, we find that the nodes have the following number of connections:
- Node 0: 2 connections 
- Node 1: 1 connection 
- Node 2: 3 connections 
- Node 3: 2 connections 
- Node 4: 3 connections 
- Node 5: 3 connections 
- Node 6: 3 connections 
- Node 7: 4 connections 
- Node 8: 3 connections 
- Node 9: 4 connections

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
