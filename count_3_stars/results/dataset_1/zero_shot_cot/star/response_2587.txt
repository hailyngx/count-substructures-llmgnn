Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7 

Now, let's look at the neighbors of each potential center node to see if they form 3-stars. 

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 7 (1, 3, 7) -> <0, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 6 (0, 4, 6) -> <1, (0, 4, 6)>

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7 (0, 4, 5) -> <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 7 (4, 5, 7) -> <3, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 9 (1, 2, 5) -> <6, (1, 2, 5)>
- Neighbors: 1, 5, 9 (1, 5, 9) -> <6, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 0, 3, 8 (0, 3, 8) -> <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- Neighbors: 3, 8 (3, 8) -> <7, (3, 8)>

Therefore, the 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 8)>. 

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
